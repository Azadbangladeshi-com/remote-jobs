#### **üßëüèª‚Äçüíª About the role**

First things first: you want to know what you‚Äôre actually applying for. It‚Äôs impossible to capture every nuance of a role ‚Äì especially at a rapidly growing company like Mews ‚Äì but if we had to distil it down to a job description (which we do because this is a job description), it would be this:

  * The backend of the Mews PMS is built with .NET Core and is deployed on Azure using services such as App Service, Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, Redis, and many others. We also use Pulumi for IaC. We‚Äôre committed to providing high availability, high scalability, and multi-regional support.
  * Front-end apps are based on similar React & Redux stacks, using styled-components for CSS and gradually being rewritten to TypeScript. 
  * All the applications are continuously integrated and deployed to production with the help of GitHub and Azure DevOps.

#### **ü§∑üèª Who is Mews?**

We want to get to know you, so it‚Äôs only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.

Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.

From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.

Mews serves over 3,000 properties across more than 70 countries around the globe and works with a huge number of hotel tech partners to provide hoteliers with an unbeatable connectivity ‚Äì no other solution offers as many integrations.

At the 2020 HotelTechAwards, Mews was voted Best PMS by industry peers. Mews was also a Best PMS Finalist in 2021 and 2022, as well as being named Best Place to Work in Hotel Tech in the same years. Mews ranked 24th in the FT 1000 fastest growing European companies in 2021.

#### **üí≠** **Life at Mews**

That‚Äôs what we do, but what about who we are? Mews‚Äô culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You‚Äôll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you‚Äôll always be able to rely on those around you.

Yes, we‚Äôre ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that‚Äôs a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.

Oh, and we love **** our pets ‚ù§Ô∏è. To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like (and to see dozens of cute cats, dogs, and hamsters), check out our Instagram üêæ.  
  
We‚Äôre guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it‚Äôs time to get in touch.  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**

To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and want to ensure we provide an inclusive experience, so do let us know if there is anything else we can do to support your application process. We can‚Äôt wait to hear from you!
