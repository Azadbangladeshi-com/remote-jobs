**ABOUT OUR ENGINEERING TEAM**

Overview of our stack:

  * Our client application is written in React and TypeScript.

  * The application is fully isomorphic, rendering application state/snapshots server-side where possible.

  * Our API services are built with Elixir, Phoenix, and PostgreSQL following the JSON API specification.

  * We run on AWS using Kubernetes and Docker.

On our engineering team, you'll be involved in the entire product development process as an equal thought partner from ideation, to engineering investigation, to design, and through implementation. At Albert, deadlines and scope are driven by the engineering team, not by teams or managers detached from the technical challenges. We take time to pay off technical debt, test, and plan long-term architectural improvements alongside new features. Most importantly, you'll see how rewarding it is to release features to tens of thousands of teachers who rely on Albert for their day-to-day instruction!

**THE ROLE**

As a Frontend/Full Stack Software Engineer, you will work with modern Javascript libraries to create accessible, interactive, and responsive interfaces that help people accelerate their learning.

You'll...

  * be a major contributor to the team by writing modern, testable and maintainable code to support Albert's roadmap;

  * take ownership of features and engineering initiatives from end-to-end by going through design, implementation, test, and maintenance cycles;

  * participate in and lead architectural and design review discussions;

  * collaborate with other engineers and the Product team to define project goals and establish milestones;

  * identify opportunities to improve existing code or architecture; and

  * embody our core values and uphold our unique company culture.

Our engineering team encourages members to pursue full-stack contributions and expand their skill set. While it is not required to work full-stack, many do and we provide mentoring and support to this end.

**BENEFITS**

  * **Competitive salary.** We observe the same pay bands, regardless of where you live. For this role, our starting salary is $100,000 - $150,000, based on experience and qualifications.

  * **Health, dental, and vision insurance.** We offer a range of options, including the best BCBS PPO Platinum plan available. The company contributes 90% of the cost for our various medical insurance options and 85% for vision and dental.

  * **One Medical.** We cover enrollment in One Medical to provide all employees with convenient access to primary care.

  * **Paid parental leave.** Parents are eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of fully paid parental leave after a year of service.

  * **A 401k plan.** Save for retirement with a fully managed plan and a 1% match.

  * **Commuter benefit.** Use pre-tax earnings on your commute through our managed platform -- although we do not maintain an office and do not have expectations to go into a particular location as a fully-remote company.

  * **Flexible, guilt-free vacation.** Take guilt-free vacations with no hard limit. Just be reasonable and considerate of the company and your teammates.

  * **Remote work.** We are a remote-first company. The majority of our team is based in Chicago, where we were founded. However, we have embraced a remote-first culture and have colleagues across the country. We do not yet support international employees.

  * **Half-day Fridays.** We value work-life balance and observe half-day Fridays every week.

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Since 2014, Albert has been powering feedback loops for students and teachers to improve educational outcomes.
