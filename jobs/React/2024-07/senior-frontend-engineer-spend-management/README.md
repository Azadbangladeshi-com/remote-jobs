In the late 19th century, the electrical industry was rapidly expanding. However, it was heavily fragmented without standard voltages, frequencies, and plug types, making it difficult for consumers. The ‚ÄúWar of Currents‚Äù emerged between proponents of DC, led by General Electric, and proponents of AC, led by Westinghouse Electric. With advancements in AC, led by Nikola Tesla, engineers and executives of both companies came together to negotiate a new technical standard. They helped establish what is now known as IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) which provided a formal platform for developing and adopting industry standards. By the early 20th century, the collaboration led to the widespread adoption of 60Hz as the standard frequency for AC power in North America and the establishment of standardized voltage levels and plug types. This standardization was crucial for the rapid expansion of the electrical grid and the proliferation of electrical appliances and
systems which consumers have benefited from for over a century.
