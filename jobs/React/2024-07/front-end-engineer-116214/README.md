## Description

Everything happens somewhere - which is why spatial analytics is fundamental to companies trying to understand the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of their business. CARTO is the leading cloud-native location intelligence platform, trusted by data scientists, data analysts, and developers from companies such as Vodafone, IKEA, BT, Coca-Cola, and Mastercard to provide geospatial insights for use cases such as site selection, geo-marketing, route optimization, network planning and much more.

  

With an exceptionally diverse team of 175 people spread across the US, Europe and APAC, CARTO (backed by Insight Partners, Accel Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Earlybird Ventures, and Kibo Ventures, among others) is changing the way companies analyze location data - making it simple to do this straight out of modern, cloud data warehouses. Redefining its category, the company has grown rapidly in recent years providing a compelling alternative to legacy GIS software.

  

CARTO has built the most advanced location intelligence platform which connects directly to the most used Data Warehouses in the industry such as Google‚Äôs BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks; thus, allowing our partners and customers to do location intelligence and geospatial analysis directly where their data lives opening limitless possibilities for their businesses.

  

The current position is open in the team responsible for the following product areas:

\- Workflows: a powerful analytics application to build geospatial analyses visually. This tool provides a set of native functions complemented with the ones in our Analytics Toolbox.

\- Analytics Toolbox: a set of SQL functions and procedures to provide spatial analytics to data warehouses such as Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Postgres.

\- Data Observatory: a great collection of public and premium geospatial datasets (+12,000). We manage the entire flow, from data ingestion to processing and distribution.

  

 **What are we looking for**

  

We are looking for a Senior Front-end Engineer to join our multidisciplinary product team and work on pioneer projects for data management, visualization, and analytics. An engineer passionate about working on product development, and willing to impact hundreds of thousands of analysts and data scientists worldwide.

  

We are working closely with engineers from Google, Amazon, Snowflake, and Databricks, to achieve the best integration and performance and provide the best capabilities to our customers.

  

If you love to be in contact with top engineers in geospatial data, this is your place!
