# [Senior iOS Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-ios-engineer-112118)  
### Mercury  
#### `ðŸŒŽ San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Portland, OR, or Remote within Canada or United States`  

In the small town of Takefu, Japan, a centuries-old tradition of crafting the world's finest kitchen knives lives on through the skilled hands of master artisans like Shiro Kamo. With each precise strike of the hammer and careful adjustment of the forge, Kamo-san infuses his unwavering dedication and passion into every knife he creates. The result is a tool that not only performs flawlessly but serves as an extension of the user's own hand, expanding the possibilities of what a talented chef can achieve. At Mercury, we draw inspiration from masters like Kamo-san as we strive to infuse the same level of skill, intuition, and beauty into our financial technology craft, particularly in our iOS app.

Just as a chef relies on their trusted knife to bring their culinary visions to life, we believe that businesses should have access to financial tools that are not only functional but also a joy to use. As we embark on this exciting journey, we are looking for a great iOS Engineer who can help us expand the Mercury iOS app, enabling our users to have peace of mind by managing their finances in a safe, stable, and beautiful application.

_* Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & TrustÂ®; Members FDIC._

**In this role, you will:**

  * Join a small-but-mighty team of experienced iOS and Android engineers (and one backend dev!) â€“ the team has been making apps for over a decade and weâ€™re pretty darn good at it.
  * Feel a strong sense of product ownership and actively seek responsibility â€“ we often self-organize on small/medium projects, and we want someone whoâ€™s excited to lay their own vision atop our foundation and make a big impact across the mobile team and Mercury as a whole.
  * Work closely with designers to ship a beautiful app â€“ they love to collaborate on getting the details right; plus, many of our customers are startups and appreciate our thoughtful, polished designs.
  * Maintain a high quality bar â€“ we provide banking services, so preventing crashes, errors, visual glitches, and wacky edge-cases is a top priority for us.

**You should:**

  * Have at least 5 years of iOS experience, preferably in Swift
  * Have experience shipping production apps in UIKit, and experience/interest in SwiftUI.   
Familiarity with RxSwift is a plus, but if you donâ€™t know a PublishSubject from a BehaviorSubject, thatâ€™s fine!

  * Have a possible interest in other parts of our stack (Android: Kotlin/Compose; Frontend: TypeScript/React; Backend: Haskell/Nix).
  * Be adaptable (we context-switch!); empathetic (recognize when a userâ€™s having a bad time); and have a good sense of humor and/or have strong feelings about puns. 
  * Above all else, weâ€™re looking for great engineers with a deep passion for iOS apps and an interest in learning â€“ _even if you donâ€™t meet all the qualifications, weâ€™d love to hear from you_!

The total rewards package at Mercury includes base salary, equity (stock options), and benefits. Our salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry. New hire offers are made based on a candidateâ€™s experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.

Our target new hire base salary ranges for this role are the following:

  * US employees (any location): $203,100- $238,900
  * Canadian employees (any location): CAD $184,800 - $217,400

We use Covey as part of our hiring and / or promotional process for jobs in NYC and certain features may qualify it as an AEDT. As part of the evaluation process we provide Covey with job requirements and candidate submitted applications. We began using Covey Scout for Inbound on January 22, 2024. Please see the independent bias audit report covering our use of Covey here.
