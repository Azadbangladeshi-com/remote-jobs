#### `ðŸŒŽ Canada (Remote)`  

**This is a remote role for candidates based in Canada Eastern time zones only.**

**What is Grafana Cloud?**

Grafana Cloud is our composable observability platform that integrates metrics, logs, and traces with Grafana. It allows our customers to leverage the best open source observability software â€“ including Prometheus, Mimir, Loki, and Tempo â€“ without the overhead of installing, maintaining, and scaling their own observability stack

At Grafana k6, we build next-generation performance testing tools for developers, DevOps and QA engineers. We are pushing forward the state-of-the-art in our industry, creating tools that have great developer experience and enable engineers to build reliable systems.

As a company we are fully remote and global, we embrace people of different experiences and backgrounds to build diverse teams where every person brings a new perspective to the software. Our tech stack is mostly made up of services written in TypeScript and Go, running on multiple Kubernetes clusters that leverage AWS.

**About the role:** **  
**

Due to our small teams and fast development pace, you will have a substantial and immediate impact on how the end product is architected, developed, and how the engineering team operates. Most importantly, you will work with competent colleagues and will be able to expand your knowledge and skills in different directions. Your responsibilities will include:

  * Develop and maintain our Electron.js app based on TypeScript and React.js
  * Collaborate with the design/product team on improving user experience
  * Take an active role in influencing our roadmap and your own career objectives
  * Work with your team to deliver new features, then use the results to iterate and improve
  * Drive projects from initial ideation all the way to operations once it is in the hands of customers
  * Be a part of your teamâ€™s on-call rotations and take ownership of the services youâ€™re running

As our engineering organization is remote, we provide guidance and meet regularly using video calls, so an independent attitude and good communication skills are a must.

**What are we looking for in you?** **  
**You are a motivated self starter with a bias towards action. You are customer focused, we build everything with our users in mind. You have a passion for creating intuitive products that fit customersâ€™ needs.

  * Pragmatism - You are able to take on complex challenges and break them down to achieve tight learning loops: to analyze, design, and build modular solutions, deliver MVPs, gather data and feedback and then progress iteratively.

  * Collaboration and communication - The smallest unit we have is a team. Youâ€™ll be working with your teammates in a fully remote setup. Good communication skills are a must.

**Requirements:**

  * Some experience with delivering projects from gathering requirements, brainstorming ideas all the way to shipping a product to the customerâ€™s hands in a self-driven way.
  * Have solid experience with single-page apps connecting to REST/APIs services.
  * Be well-versed in TypeScript, ES6+ and modern CSS
  * Have solid experience with Electron.js
  * Solid experience with React.js 
  * Experience architecting clean, resilient and user friendly web apps that are easily maintained by others.

**Itâ€™s an advantage if you:**

  * have experience with Node.js
  * have experience with React-query
  * have experience with any form of state management library connecting with React.js
  * have experience in data analyzing and presenting charts, trends, etc.
