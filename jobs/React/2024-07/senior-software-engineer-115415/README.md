# [Senior Software Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-115415)  
### Grow Therapy  
#### `ðŸŒŽ New York, New York, United States, Remote`  

**About the Role**

As an early engineer at Grow, youâ€™ll have a huge amount of scope and autonomy. You get to see a number of different product surface areas (provider portal, marketplace, client experience, infrastructure, and enabling operations) in addition to working full-stack (Flask/Python on the backend, React/TypeScript on the frontend, infrastructure on AWS).

**What you'll do**

**We have multiple roles open. Some examples of projects you may work on include:**

  * **Making a robust cost estimation and eligibility checking platform** \- Youâ€™ll pull in data from different sources and implement the logic and infrastructure that allows us to give cost estimates for every insurance type our providers accept.

  * **Creating a world-class note-taking experience for providers** \- Notes are where our providers spend most of their day! Youâ€™ll own the full-stack experience of notes syncing, intelligent prefilling, and caching notes to create a best-in-class experience.

  * **Optimizing search ranking and performance at scale** \- there are thousands of providers who accept many different insurance types, have unique backgrounds, and differing amounts of availability. Help us create a search algorithm that matches clients with the right therapist for them!

**Who you are**

  * 4+ years in engineering. Youâ€™ve built and scaled systems, made complex engineering decisions, and have proved out your technical skills in industry.

  * Full-stack web development experience. You have experience working with REST APIs, web frameworks, an understanding of HTML, CSS, JS and at least one backend language.

  * Entrepreneurial spirit. You have worked in a startup or on your own side projects and built products from the ground up.

  * Product thinker. You want to build through a user-centric lens and be involved not only in engineering decisions but product and design decisions as well.

  * Leader. Youâ€™ll do anything to achieve your goal. You know how to think on the fly and persist through setbacks and roadblocks and to motivate your teammates to do the same.

  * Team Player. You are collaborative by nature, relish in camaraderie and group wins, and are looked to by colleagues as a steadfast partner and source of encouragement

  * Highly Motivated. You want ownership of your work.

**Bonus Points**

  * Experience with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL

  * Python and Flask Experience

  * Interesting side projects!

**Engineering team principles**

  * You own what you build. You will feel ownership of the code you write, articulate the importance of the feature, and follow up to ensure it's successful.

  * We build solutions for our providers and clients. We write code to solve user problems, not just for the sake of solving technical problems.

  * You are not part of the tech team, but rather part of the team itself! Grow is a tech-enabled business and not a pure software business, so understanding how the business works is integral to your job.

The salary range for this position is $168,000 to $220,000 per year.
