  * Familiar with the Android ecosystem, including understanding feature sets and implementing best practices across devices and operating system versions. 

  * Proficient in web technologies with the ability to effectively write and debug JS-based applications.

  * Excellent communication skills, with a proactive approach to client support and team collaboration.

  * Adept in modern development practices, including automated testing and continuous integration for library development.

Nice to have
