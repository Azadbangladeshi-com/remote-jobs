Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About** **Marketing**

Creatives at Consensys make work that moves the crypto industry forward, spreading our leading-edge products far and wide into the world and pushing for the adoption of Web3 technology. Weâ€™re an ambitious team, using our unique point of view to create work that infiltrates crypto culture, influences mindsets, and prizes ourselves on being defiantly optimistic.

**What youâ€™ll do**

Linea has shown tremendous growth since its mainnet launch July 2023, solidifying its rank and potential in the L2 landscape. One of the crucial levers to maintaining this momentum is ensuring that developers feel excited and supported to build on Linea, specifically creating energy for new and exploratory entrants to web3 so that they make Linea their first home. In order to do this, we need to engage with individual developers before they have already decided what and where to build. As such, we need to capture and incubate them by planning and executing builder programs such as hackathons and cohesive educational content while still engaging at an individual level to imbue a sense of community and dedicated support. As it stands currently, we only have one head count to support this role for the entire builder ecosystem. This ask is for an additional IC to devote 100% of their time to landing and engaging an early developer community.

As a developer relations engineer at Linea, youâ€™ll play a critical role in building and nurturing a developer community. Weâ€™re looking for engineers who love to build fast and explore new technologies, inspiring that same energy in the Linea developer community! Youâ€™ll do this by:

  * Engaging our developers on X, Farcaster, Discord, Github, and Telegram
  * Resolving technical issues and queries from developers
  * Traveling to events and collaborating at hackathons around the world to meet and help developers where theyâ€™re at
  * Identifying and filling content or developer tooling gaps to make the developer experience as smooth as butter
  * Building experimentally in public with the Linea community â€“ capitalizing on hype when it happens, such as frames, ERC 404, and whatever future innovations come out
  * Managing mini-contests for hackers in the Linea community

**Would be great if you brought this to the role**

  * 2+ years of developer relations experience or related software engineering experience
  * Effective written and verbal skills with the ability to distill complex concepts simply
  * Ability to thrive in a dynamic setting with limited supervision
  * Strong computer science foundations with JavaScript, Solidity, and popular frameworks and tools like React and Hardhat as youâ€™ll be coding at least 30% of the time
  * Passion and familiarity with the web3 landscape
  * Strong interpersonal skills

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. Weâ€™re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environmentâ€”apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.
