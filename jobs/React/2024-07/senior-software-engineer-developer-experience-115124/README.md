# [Senior Software Engineer, Developer Experience](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-developer-experience-115124)  
### Block  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote,Atlanta, GA`  

### **Company Description**

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldnâ€™t work together.  
  
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions â€“ to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, weâ€™ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  
  
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes â€“ large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. Weâ€™re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
