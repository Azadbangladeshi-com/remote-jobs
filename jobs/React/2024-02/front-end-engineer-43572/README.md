**Description**

Sprout Social is looking to hire a Software Engineer, Front End to the Engineering team.

**Why join Sprout‚Äôs Engineering team?**

With collaborative cross-functional teams that span mobile, front-end, back-end, QA and site reliability engineering‚Äîthe Sprout Engineering team is a place to sharpen your craft and solve hard problems with the smartest people in the industry. You‚Äôll get to work on a ‚Äútech-giant‚Äù scale with smaller, supportive teams where every engineer has the chance to make an impact on our company, and our customers. The best part? In our industry, you often have to switch jobs or even companies to learn a new part of a tech stack or business. But at Sprout, our product is a suite, so you just need to move teams. You‚Äôre able to diversify your skills, which not only benefits your team‚Äîbut also your career.

**What you‚Äôll do**

  * Write clean, performant, and maintainable code.
  * Provide technical leadership and guidance to other team members, including junior engineers.
  * Work closely with cross-functional teams, including backend developers, designers, product managers, and QA engineers, to deliver world class customer experiences.
  * Participate in and conduct code reviews to maintain code quality, provide feedback, and ensure adherence to coding standards.
  * Continuously improve the codebase by identifying areas for refactoring and optimization to enhance maintainability and scalability.

**What you‚Äôll bring**

We‚Äôre looking for a creative, highly motivated, and inquisitive learner to build great software with us. If you confidently write web applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, we‚Äôd love to talk with you!

The minimum qualifications for this role include:

  * 3+ years of experience with planning, building, and releasing frontend applications with web technologies (Javascript, HTML, and CSS)

Preferred qualifications for this role include:

  * Experience building web applications with React, Redux, and/or similar web technologies.
  * Experience working in a large codebase
  * Communication and project management skills from collaborating with people across different teams and functional areas.

**How you‚Äôll grow**

Within 1 month, you‚Äôll plant your roots, including:

  * Complete Sprout‚Äôs New Hire training program alongside other new Sprout team members.
  * Deliver business value by shipping your first code change with active pairing/mentoring from your teammates.
  * Learn how code is deployed to our end users through collaboration with front end developers on your team.
  * Have a firm understanding of the team‚Äôs roadmap and the team‚Äôs Agile processes by having discussions with your team‚Äôs product manager.

Within 3 months, you‚Äôll start hitting your stride by:

  * Independently own and deliver stories without peer consultation given user acceptance criteria and visual mockups.
  * Adhere to the team‚Äôs engineering best practices, such as testing expectations, shared patterns, and documentation.
  * Openly communicate with all disciplines of the team, including back-end engineers, QA, product design and product managers, in order to move the team‚Äôs work forward.
  * Contribute to team processes by participating in team activities, such as code review, estimation, technical specification planning, collaboration in requirements definition, and contribution of feedback during retrospectives.
  * Fix production bugs by participating in your team‚Äôs support rotation.

Within 6 months, you‚Äôll be making a clear impact through:

  * Author a technical specification plan for a roadmap project and collaborate with teammates to create an agreed upon delivery plan.
  * Mentor junior teammates to provide guidance and coaching on code implementation, design review, and other software engineering and Agile practices.
  * Understand how the team uses React and other JavaScript frameworks and be comfortable explaining relevant details to other engineers.
  * Collaborate effectively with your team‚Äôs product manager and QA to ensure that projects are delivered on time and with quality.
  * Understand the web application‚Äôs JavaScript build system (e.g. Gulp, webpack). Optionally, you may have contributed enhancements to our local and production build tasks.
  * Have knowledge of your team‚Äôs target customer base and their most common use cases within the application.

Within 12 months, you‚Äôll make this role your own by:

  * Have an understanding of all aspects of Sprout‚Äôs web application, including server side web code, production hosting infrastructure, and ancillary services, such as the PDF generation and email delivery services.
  * Demonstrate end-to-end responsibility for delivering roadmap projects on time, from technical planning to performing/guiding implementation to testing to final delivery.
  * Balance the continuum of trade-offs during code design, knowing that solutions can favor faster delivery with less strict technical requirements or solutions can favor future technical maintainability with delayed delivery of customer value.
  * Identify a technical initiative (e.g. technical debt, introduction of a new system, need for a new JavaScript dependency, performance improvement, etc) that is prioritized as a quarterly roadmap project for your team.

Of course what is outlined above is the ideal timeline, but things may shift based on business needs and other projects and tasks could be added at the discretion of your manager.

**Our Benefits Program**

We‚Äôre proud to regularly be recognized for our team, product and culture. Our benefits program includes:

  * Insurance and benefit options that are built for both individuals and families
  * Progressive policies to support work/life balance, like our flexible paid time off and parental leave program

  * Wellness initiatives to ensure both health and mental well-being of our team
  * Ongoing education and development opportunities via our Grow@Sprout program, employee-led diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and mentorship programs for aspiring leaders
