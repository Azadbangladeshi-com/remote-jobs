### Octopus Energy  
#### `ðŸ’° ` `ðŸŒŽ Spain`  

Energy is changing.

For years, it was an industry dominated by large suppliers using outdated systems that put profits first and customers last. Now, weâ€™re using the latest technology and green generation to transform energy for customers, bringing the UK cheaper, greener, and fairer energy.

We enjoy the best of both worlds: backing from a Â£6bn business of highly experienced and talented individuals, and the dynamic environment of a start-up.

We are the only Which? recommended energy supplier for 2019, the uSwitch supplier of the year, Energy Awards supplier of the year, and UK customer experience award winner for utilities.

Youâ€™ll be working for a company thatâ€™s fighting climate change. Weâ€™re the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. Weâ€™re helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.

And for big change, we need big minds.

Weâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s passionate about code, curious, and eager to learn. Youâ€™ll be working alongside other talented people in the tech department. Youâ€™ll solve problems with technology to make us, and the industry, smarter and better for customers.

### Our team

All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around 500 people globally. This includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers.

We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs and Asana to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.

Some of our coding conventions are open-source .

Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.
