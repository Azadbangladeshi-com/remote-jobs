### Ev.energy  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ New York, NY,Remote,Ontario`  

ev.energy set up in 2018 to make electric vehicle charging greener, simpler and cheaper. We do this by ingesting real-time data from various sources which, partnered with our smart-charging algorithm, means we align charging sessions with energy from renewable sources, helping drivers avoid charging their car at peak times using fossil-fuel derived energy.

EVs are growing in popularity; a third of new cars sold by 2030 will be electric. At the same time, power outages in the US have already grown 64% from the previous decade, and the rise of EV ownership will likely cause further strain. Solutions like ours offer a way to reduce this demand on the grid, benefitting utilities as well as drivers and the environment.

To make this happen weâ€™ve brought together a great team of 100+ bringing expertise from previous roles at National Grid, Tesla, Amazon, Enel-X, Meta and others, secured over 50m USD in funding, and achieved accolades like â€˜Worldâ€™s Best Energy Start-Upâ€™ in the Free Electrons programme. Weâ€™re looking for more mission-driven and talented folk to join the team, working remotely in either Europe or North America, to drive change for the better.
