**Company Mission**

Aktos is a seed-stage, Vertical SaaS Fintech startup looking for a Founding Full Stack Engineer (70/30 Backend leaning) who will play a key role in building the Operating System that powers the $18B Credit Collections industry.

Credit Collectors play an overlooked yet integral part of our financial ecosystem. They help Consumers settle their debts and improve their credit scoresâ€” granting them clean states to start over. Collectors help critical businesses like doctor's offices and local governments, who deal with high payment default risk, secure their revenue streams and ensure their continued survival.

In truth, Collectors have incredibly interesting, multi-faceted jobs. They are often one part sales person, one part therapist, and one part detective in their mission to recover funds. At Aktos, we are building a modern software platform that caters to Collectors' unique workflows, and make the credit recovery process a more positive experience for all parties.
