# [Senior Frontend Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-frontend-engineer-55024)  
### Sparta Commodities  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Spain`  

### Hey, we're Sparta Commodities!

We are a Swiss, VC-backed scaleup with a global reach. Our mission is to digitize the commodity trading market and become the leading platform for traders in all commodities verticals. We've already gained significant market traction and are financially backed by Venture Investors.

We have a fantastic opportunity available for a driven and passionate Senior Frontend Engineer to join our growing Engineering team, based remotely in Spain or the UK. This is a great career opportunity for an experienced and delivery-focused Senior Frontend Engineer to play a key role in the development and maintenance of various front-end systems, including an Excel plug in, for a leading and highly regarded business.

### About The Team

Our naturally diverse teams are divided into verticals, with a mix of multidisciplinary members. Each team has at least 3 Backend Engineers, 3 Frontend Engineers, a Designer, a QA Engineer, a Product Owner, and a Team Manager. We work on bi-weekly sprints with quarterly goals. Each project is kicked off by a product request, from which we build a technical proposal that is refined within the team. Once the project has been greenlit one team member becomes its owner. An owner follows the project through development and deployment, making the other team member accountable for their responsibilities.

### About The Tech

We have a modern React website built using the latest Vite, using libraries such as Redux and SWR. Our Components are designed around Material UI and styled with SASS. We have plenty of financial data to graph in charts, for which we have extended chartjs. Our designers share Figma wireframes with beautiful adaptive designs.

But our use of web technologies isnâ€™t limited to frontend. We share parts of our code with a Node backend. And we've also ventured into using TypeScript to develop Excel Add-Ins.

In 2023 we doubled our website's screen count, with intentions to sextuple it by late 2024. We will also start serving dynamic content, migrating from the client-only experience we have today.

### About You

We are looking for someone who has had ownership of projects from inception until after release, and who is familiar with observability, product metrics, and maintainability. They will be involved in the design of technical solutions as owner and implementor, on top of reviewing designs from other team members.

On your day-to-day, you will work within the team reviewing code, and promoting initiatives to improve our code quality, maintainability, and development experience. As part of the development sprints, you will release new features and products using quality practices such as automated testing, QA validation, and monitorization.

### Requirements

  * Ownership and accountability for projects and their product metrics
  * Extensive experience with React
  * Knowledge of server-side rendering techniques and architectures
  * A body of work in design systems
  * Experience with Jest, Mocha or other common testing libs
  * High communication skills in a remote-first company with a diverse workforce

### Bonus Points

  * NextJS or similar
  * Experience with cypress for e2e tests
  * Prior work on real-time systems such as WebSockets, stock tickers, or videogames
  * Experience and prior work with Redux

### Benefits and Perks

  * Remote working, with occasional travel to a central hub for collaborative meetings and coordination. 
  * Attractive company stock option plan. 
  * Yearly companywide meet ups in sunny locations. 
  * Training and education budget. 
  * Private Medical Insurance. 
  * Access to the optimal gear suited for your position.
