### CARTO  
#### `üåé Spain`  

Everything happens somewhere - which is why spatial analytics is fundamental to companies trying to understand the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of their business. CARTO is the leading cloud-native location intelligence platform, trusted by data scientists, data analysts and developers from companies such as Vodafone, IKEA, BT, Coca-Cola, to provide geospatial insights for use cases such as site selection, geomarketing, route optimization, network planning and much more.

With an exceptionally diverse team of 150 people spread across the US and Europe, CARTO (backed by Accel Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Earlybird Ventures, and Kibo Ventures, among others) is changing the way companies analyze location data - making it simple to do this straight out of modern, cloud data warehouses. Redefining its category, the company has grown rapidly in recent years providing a compelling alternative to legacy GIS software.

CARTO with its new CARTO 3 platform has built the most advanced location intelligence platform which connects directly to the most used Data Warehouses in the industry such as Google‚Äôs BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake and Databricks; thus, allowing our partners and customers to do location intelligence and geospatial analysis directly where their data lives opening limitless possibilities for their businesses.

The Accounts Workspace team at CARTO is composed of 7 engineers, all of them working remotely. The position is indeed fully remote, but you should be in a compatible time zone, to be able to have some sync meetings (ideally 3-4 h around Central European Time)

On the frontend side, where this position is focused on, we use React + Redux / Sagas + React Query.

Other frontend areas to collaborate with, will be:

\- CARTO for React: library/framework to develop applications using CARTO and React to manage our Design System

\- Builder: WebGL-powered, high-performance web application for geospatial analytic visualizations. Based on the well-known Open Source project kepler.gl. React + Redux

\- Workflows: our no-code workflow design tool to automate data preparation analysis pipelines in geo spatial.

\- deck.gl is one of the most popular Open Source mapping libraries, it‚Äôs a WebGL-powered reactive framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets. Our CTO belongs to the technical steering committee and our team members are very active committers on this repo. So far, our major contributions to it are the MVTLayer, the CARTO module, the integration with Google Maps, and the following extensions: MaskExtension, CollisionFilterExtension.
