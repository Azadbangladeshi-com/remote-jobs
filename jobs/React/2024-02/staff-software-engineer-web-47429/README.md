Joining its powerful, intuitive platform with its vibrant, distinguished brand, GlossGenius is the ideal combination of a fintech, SMB software, and consumer company all in one.

**About the role**

As a Staff Software Engineer, Web at GlossGenius, you are focused on some of GlossGenius's most complex and highest-impact opportunities. You will typically be the technical lead for a team or a large technical domain, work closely with cross-functional teams on team roadmap planning and OKRs, and influence critical technical decisions. As a technical leader, your impact extends beyond your direct team and beyond the broader engineering organization. You hold a high bar, inspire, and level up the engineers around you, and you're able to zoom out and think about high-level architecture and business problems but are still able to roll up your sleeves and write code when needed.

GlossGenius has grown significantly, supporting tens of thousands of customers and seeing billions of transaction volumes on our platforms. As our customers continue to grow their businesses, we want to enable them to be more successful. We are hiring across both our Core Product and Growth Vertical Product Engineering teams.

This role can be based remotely anywhere in Canada.

**What Youâ€™ll Do**

  * Take high-level business requirements and develop the technical details behind them. Collaborate with Product Managers and Engineering Managers to write design docs, and ensure the tasks are appropriately broken down and prioritized, well understood by the team, and sized correctly for rollout.
  * Continually drive our engineering standards (code reuse, documentation, testing, etc.) and levels of service forward. Identify gaps in the engineering process and come up with proposed solutions. Work with the right stakeholders and push the change to completion. Monitor the change and iterate as needed.
  * Own problems and domains from end to end, managing complexity, identifying and engaging directly with stakeholders to think through everything from the business impact to reliability, operability, and security; always approaching situations with a bias to action.
  * Provide technical leadership to a distributed engineering team to design new and enhance existing GlossGenius product offerings.
  * Advise the GlossGenius leadership team on key technology and product roadmap considerations.
  * Architect tools, services, and systems using well-accepted design patterns to allow for iterative, autonomous development and future scaling.
  * Uphold GlossGeniusâ€™s high engineering and product quality standards, and provide mentorship to team members to get to the next level.

**What Weâ€™re Looking For**

  * 7+ years of software engineering experience, 3+ years of technical leadership experience.
  * You have a breadth of experience working in a full-stack capacity or a front-end leaning role.
  * You are able to autonomously identify and prioritize the highest impact work thatâ€™s urgent and worthy of your time.
  * You have excellent product instincts and think about our users first and are able to root decisions in the business context. Experience shipping consumer-facing products is 0 to 1 is a plus!
  * You are able to communicate complex concepts to different audiences effectively and have experience coordinating across teams to ship critical products.
  * You have experience with building a long-term roadmap and technical vision to tackle complex user problems plus an ability to break it down for other team members to execute on.
  * You have architectural and system design expertise in developing highly scalable and performant distributed systems.
  * You thrive in a collaborative environment involving different functions, stakeholders, and subject matter experts.
  * You're a continuous learner - learn and grow constantly to feed your passion for self-improvement and make those around you better.
  * You're comfortable picking up new technologies (our team builds on Ruby, React, Kotlin, and React Native, and our stack will continue to evolve.)

**Benefits & Perks**

  * Flexible PTO
  * Competitive health & dental insurance options, with premiums covered by GG
  * Generous, fully-paid parental leave policy
  * Retirement Savings Plan
  * Professional Development - employees receive a yearly stipend for approved learning and educational-related expenses
  * Home office support
  * Team Bonding opportunities - as a distributed team, building meaningful bonds virtually and in person is incredibly important to us! We are constantly evaluating how we accomplish this and currently, teams are given opportunities to gather in person throughout the year

_At GlossGenius, we celebrate our differences and are committed to creating a workplace where all employees feel supported and empowered to do their best work. We believe this benefits not only our employees but our product, customers, and community as well. GlossGenius is proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer._
