# [Staff Engineer for Permissions team](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/staff-engineer-for-permissions-team)  
### Productboard  
#### `ðŸŒŽ London`  

Join one of our product teams and develop features with real value for a one-of-a-kind product management system used by 4500+ global companies.

When we started in 2014, our focus was on product managers in smaller teams who lacked a great product management tool. Today, we are the leading product management platform. We now help much larger companies with thousands of employees, and we deal with quite different needs and personas.

We're facing a huge architectural shift in terms of how we scale our product. To meet the growing demands of the enterprise market, weâ€™re in an ongoing redesign of our systems. The aim is to make both the user experience and underlying system work at large scale â€” considering performance, flexibility and seamless access management

Setting up appropriate access levels allows product teams to easily share, and safely collaborate, inside the Productboard ecosystem, while also maintaining control over their most important or sensitive data.

The Permissions team works across two constructs, shaping how users can access the _capabilities_ and _content_ of our platform. We design the AuthN and AuthZ systems, which are provided as a service to customers as well as the other product teams at Productboard, giving our team both a strong product component and platform aspect.

**Exciting product & technical challenges**

We want our customers â€“ both small and large â€“ to be able to collaborate without the burden of complex access management. To that end, the challenge we are currently working on is to design and deploy a centralized authorization system that offers flexibility for the largest of enterprises, while keeping the access management as simple and straightforward as possible.

This is no small task and we will need you to put your data modeling and system design hat on. For those looking for an exciting and complex tech initiative, with impact across the entire Productboard platform, hereâ€™s your chance. Help us develop the ultimate AuthZ platform, and manage the complex migration away from the legacy one.
