###  **Job Description**

Overview

We are seeking a talented and motivated Application Engineer to join our team. In this role, you will be part of the AI & Cloud Engineering (ACE) Division and AI Workbench team. Our AI Workbench is a cloud-based environment to accelerate Automotive AI Software Development and Evaluation. The AI Workbench has 4 main functional blocks today, with one of those blocks providing access to both SILS (Software in the Loop Simulator) and HILS (Hardware in the Loop Simulator).

As an Application Engineer - ACE, you will be responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining web-based applications that meet our organization’s needs and requirements. You should have a strong background in web development, programming languages, and software engineering principles, as well as a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web applications.

Our division’s mission is to use the latest AI and cloud technologies to develop the best AI inference for advanced driver safety engineers building self-driving vehicles and other high performance compute products. Renesas is the leading automotive electronics supplier globally, and this is a rare opportunity to develop the infrastructure required to deploy our AI software to the billions of devices we ship to customers every year. You will join our newly formed AI & Cloud Engineering organization of around 100 software engineers.
