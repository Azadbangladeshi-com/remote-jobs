**✨ Our Culture**

TL&DR - Pulley is a unique fit, tailored for those who align with our values and culture. We are looking for people who are excited about building a great company, not just working in a high-growth startup. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:

  * First Principles Thinking. We believe in breaking down problems into their most basic parts. We don’t reject ideas because they haven’t worked before. We understand “ _why_ did certain things work?” and apply it to our situation.
  * Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don’t fixate on the finish line.
  * Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback.
  * Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn’t know it was impossible.

We’re also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues. If you like the sound of our environment and you’re passionate about joining a team like the one we’ve described, we'd love to talk!

Annual Salary Range: $130k - $165k USD
