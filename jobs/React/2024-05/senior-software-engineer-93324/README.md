As a **Senior Software Engineer** , you'll have the opportunity to push our product in new directions while also shaping the next iterations of the features our customers already love. You'll define the future of core pieces of our backend across areas like our data model, or authentication, or integrations, as well as core pieces of our frontend like design systems, or rich visualizations.

  * Grow your expertise and fluency with core pieces of technology across the full application stack
