# [Staff Frontend Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/staff-frontend-engineer-86454)  
### Pulley  
#### `🌎 Remote`  

Pulley's mission is to make it easier for anyone to start a company. We believe that more startups should exist and that founder-led companies are more successful in the long term. With Pulley’s cap table management tools, companies can better understand and optimize their equity for the long term. Starting a company is hard enough. Managing equity shouldn’t be.

We’re a high-performing team looking for passionate, execution-focused, self-starters to help us build equity management tools for founders. Pulley is growing quickly with over 3000 customers including unicorns like Clubhouse, Birdies, and Coda - all within our first year of product launch.

Our trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founders’ Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels. All of our growth has been organic, and we’re growing the team to meet the demand.

**🌟 Staff Frontend Engineer**

We’re looking for an experienced Frontend Engineer to join and be a key member of our engineering team. You will play a critical role in designing, developing, and maintaining our front-end components, ensuring a seamless user experience and robust functionality. This is a unique opportunity to work with a talented team on challenging projects that have a real impact on our industry.

🚨 We're offering an open coding challenge as a first step in our interviewing process. You can find it at https://ciphersprint.pulley.com/ ; it will give you all instructions needed. We'll be reaching out to everyone who completes the challenge and who we think will be a good fit at Pulley based on your application. If you're planning on completing the challenge, you should first submit a job application here, and then complete the challenge using the same email address as the one you submitted here; we will automatically match your completion to your application and advance you to our next stage.

**✨ Our Culture**

TL&DR - Pulley is a unique fit, tailored for those who align with our values and culture. We are looking for people who are excited about building a great company, not just working in a high-growth startup. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:

  * First Principles Thinking. We believe in breaking down problems into their most basic parts. We don’t reject ideas because they haven’t worked before. We understand “ _why_ did certain things work?” and apply it to our situation.
  * Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don’t fixate on the finish line.
  * Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback.
  * Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn’t know it was impossible.

We’re also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues. If you like the sound of our environment and you’re passionate about joining a team like the one we’ve described, we'd love to talk!

Annual Salary Range: $130k - $210k USD
