### Headway  
#### `üí∞ USD 152000.0~230000.0` `üåé United States`  

Headway‚Äôs mission is a big one - to build a new mental health care system everyone can access. We‚Äôve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don‚Äôt accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to take insurance and scale their practice.

Headway was founded in 2019 ‚Äì since then, we‚Äôve grown into a diverse, national network of over 25,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software. We‚Äôre a Series C company with over $225m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, and Health Care Service Corporation.

We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. **Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.**
