### **About Found**

The self-employed workforce is a rapidly growing, resilient, and colorful 60 million Americans. But self-employment comes with its own set of challenges: navigating taxes, accounting, bookkeeping, and business banking are just a few. Thatâ€™s where we come in.

Found is building tools that give self-employed people the security and peace of mind that has historically only been possible at big corporations. Weâ€™re a business bank account that automates taxes and expense tracking because we believe small business owners should spend more time doing what they love and less time on their business finances.

Weâ€™re looking for kind, resourceful, and passionate people to join us in building the safety net for self-employment.
