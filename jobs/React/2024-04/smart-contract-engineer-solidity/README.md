# [Smart Contract Engineer (Solidity)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/smart-contract-engineer-solidity)  
### Randamu  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

Randamu is looking for a fully remote Solidity developer on a full-time, permanent basis. Salary is a flat rate for company of $240,000 cash, (meaning actual take-home salary will depend on local taxes, social deductions and such) though will be augmented with tokens upon launch.  
  
  

Description  
  

  
You will be the go-to person for all of our code that lives on-chain. In the short term, this includes smart contracts for randomness retrieval, upload and verification. In the medium to long term, this will include development and deployment of a token to back the value in the drand and Randamu ecosystems, and contracts for managing the lifecycle of interaction with an off-chain decryption committee for key-management and encrypted messaging.  
  
Being a small company, you'll be expected to be comfortable designing and architecting solutions, presenting them to the rest of the team, reading and writing specifications for public consumption, and working at other layers of the stack when all hands are on deck.  
  
  

Skills  
  

  
_Must have_  
  

  * Strong background in Solidity - gas optimisation, bytecode twiddling, and security are key
  * web3.js or ethers.js
  * Foundry or Hardhat
  * Solid knowledge of cryptographic primitives and protocols
  * Experience with 1 or more EVM blockchains

  
_Desirable_  
  

  * Strong background in a backend language (rust or go would be great)
  * Some frontend experience (React and Typescript predominantly, but we're open to more exotic things)
  * Threshold cryptography
  * Experience developing and deploying SNARKs on-chain

  

> About Randamu  
>  
>

We are a lean, well-funded startup focused on web3 infrastructure. Our flagship project, drand, provides publicly verifiable randomness that powers Filecoin consensus among other blockchains and applications.  
  
Our mission is to integrate drand into as many blockchain ecosystems as possible and deliver new threshold cryptosystems into production for use cases such as committee encryption and decryption, key management, MEV prevention and oracles.  
  
We're all professionals with long breadth of experience in web3, big tech, finance and cybersecurity.  
  
We enjoy presenting at conferences, attending hacker camps and making espresso in weird and wonderful ways.  
  
We are a remote-first culture, spread across EU and US time zones. As a result, we travel quite regularly.  
  
  

Benefits  
  

  * unlimited paid time off
  * annual conference budget
  * $3000 hardware allowance
  * (optional) quarterly coworking in a new city
