  * Ability to work collaboratively in a fast-paced environment and adapt to changing priorities, ideally at an early stage start up

  * Ability to translate product or design requirements into parallelizable and incrementally releasable tasks

  * Experience balancing short-term deliverables with making long-term investments for efficiency, scale, and performance

 **It Would Be Great if You Had**

  * Experience with Rust

  * Previous work in high transaction services like message queue systems or billing systems
