# **Job Details:**

## Job Description:

Intelligent Systems Research Lab (ISR) is focused on multi-disciplinary research spanning ethnography, design, HCI, and AI to create Human/AI collaborative systems that can amplify human potential and create sustainable and transparent AI solutions. We utilize multi-modal signals (e.g. vision, audio, speech, language, RF) and AI to infer and predict human state and actions and enable physically situated dialog and interactions. We conduct this research in the context of vertical domains including manufacturing, education, enterprise, and assistive computing for people with disabilities.  
  
ISR is looking for an Intern passionate about building novel Multimodal Interaction Agents. This work will involve developing efficient multimodal architectures and pipelines for vision/language interaction systems for real-time task guidance support, in particular (but not limited to) manufacturing domain.  
In this context, the intern will be able to explore methods to improve LLM-based Retrieval-based pipelines from complex metadata in documents (e.g., free form text, tables and figures), prompting approaches (e.g., ReAct, multimodal-react, thought-prompting etc.) and conversational Human/Assistant dialogues to generate responses that are factually correct and may involve multi-step reasoning.  
  
You will be building and evaluating systems and proofs-of-concept that will allow for the deployment of scalable approaches in real settings. This research will enable validation of the ideas and the publication of findings in both internal and external venues.

_This is an internship position and compensation will be given accordingly._
