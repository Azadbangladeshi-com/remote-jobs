_**We are a team of doers, seasoned engineers, hackers and builders, working on the future of streaming data.  
  
**_

_Funded by premier investors including GV and Lightspeed, Redpanda is building the streaming data platform for developers. We‚Äôre evolving streaming beyond the Apache Kafka¬Æ protocol into a unified ‚Äúengine of record‚Äù that delivers a categorical reduction in complexity, wicked-fast performance, onboard Wasm transforms, and transparent tiered storage that gives consumers access to both real-time and historical data from a single API._

######

**_About the Role:_**

The Core Engineering team‚Äôs mission is to create the best data streaming platform. The team consists of experts in foundational technologies such as Raft/consensus, transactions and distributed storage, who have come together to build a differentiated, highly performant product with compelling traction in the market. We work closely across multiple functions at Redpanda and our work directly drives key business metrics through various SaaS and self-managed offerings. Redpanda is growing and so are we.

We are looking for a performance and scalability expert who will help with the Core Engineering team‚Äôs mandate to push Redpanda‚Äôs scale and performance up to the limit of what the underlying hardware is capable of. Low latency is a core tenet of our product philosophy.

**_You will:_**

  * Contribute to understanding bottlenecks and hotspots in high throughput complex distributed systems
  * Optimize software, all the way from specific subsystems to large inter-system interactions employing varied tools and techniques
  * Build tooling and enable testing to ensure Redpanda‚Äôs performance continues to be a first class citizen
  * Work with engineering team members who deeply care about our craft and take pride in what we deliver
  * Help shape Redpanda‚Äôs future while learning and growing professionally

**_You have:_**

  * A strong understanding and experience in C++
  * Substantial relevant experience of at least 7 years in a professional role
  * Prior experience in working on deeply technical projects in the realm of performance optimization, scalability, concurrency and parallelism, replication protocols, and correctness
  * Passion for making software run faster and more efficiently through techniques such as compiler optimizations, cache-line access optimized data structures or compression techniques
  * Desire to further develop your skills in building scalable and performant systems
  * Pride in writing robust, well-abstracted code and care as much about deleting dead code as writing new code
  * Experience or desire to work with a 100% distributed engineering team, collaborating on GitHub, in the open
  * Excellent written communication skills

**_You are:_**

  * Passionate about world-class systems software development and the value it provides
