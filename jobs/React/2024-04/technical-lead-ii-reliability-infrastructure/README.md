Description

**About the team**

The HubSpot Product team is made up of over 1000+ engineers, designers, product managers, and researchers. Weâ€™re passionate about building tools that help small and medium-sized businesses market, sell, and serve their customers â€” and ultimately, grow better.

Those tools end up in the HubSpot application platform, which itself is made up of thousands of services, workers, and jobs spanning over 170 teams and thousands of repos. Our teams work autonomously to deploy these systems across a common infrastructure, up to 3,000 times a day. As weâ€™ve grown to serve over 75,000 customers in 100 countries, reliability and stability have become just as important as speed and time to market. And as weâ€™ve opened up our APIs, our product has moved to the core of many of our customersâ€™ and partnersâ€™ businesses.

In 2019, we built an SRE team to help our product teams focus on delivering highly available and dependable products. This team is off to a great start: evangelizing, building tools, and embedding onto product teams. We are looking to grow this team by hiring engineers with an interest in reliability and scale. This is an opportunity to work on hard problems across a variety of domains with an experienced team of software engineers.
