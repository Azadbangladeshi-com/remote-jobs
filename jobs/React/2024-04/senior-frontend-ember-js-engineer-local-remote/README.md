**Why work at ZenCase?**

At ZenCase, we build powerful web applications for law firms. Weâ€™re a small, development driven startup company, founded by a lawyer. Most of the engineers at ZenCase are remote, however we do have an office in Jacksonville, FL if you want to work in an office environment. While prior experience working remotely isn't required, we are looking for team members who perform well given a high level of independence and autonomy if you choose to work remote.  
  

Some of the reasons our team have said they love working at ZenCase is:

  * The remote-first culture gives me a lot of flexibility to balance work with other personal and family commitments. I'm able to adapt my schedule to fit in the things I've not been able to at previous jobs, without the expectation of also being always on. Everyone has been encouraging of having clear boundaries between work and non-work time.

  

**What would you be working on?  
** ZenCase is a lawfirm practice management software that enables lawyers to work more efficiently by managing their contacts, matters, time, and billing in one place.  
  

Our products are built on JavaScript and Ruby on Rails, so you'll spend most of your time working in Javascript building new features with our team.

  * Contribute to various parts of our product, which consists of a Ruby on Rails backend and Ember.js frontend
