Description

**We are open to hiring a Senior or Staff Engineer for this role.**

  

 **What Weâ€™re Building**

Honeycomb defined the concept of observability and is raising expectations of what our developer tools can do! Honeycomb is the observability platform that enables engineering teams to find and solve problems they couldn't before. It enables engineers to answer novel questions about their ever-evolving cloud applications, so they can deploy confidently, resolve incidents faster and focus on high-value work that drives innovation. Weâ€™re working with well known companies like HelloFresh, Slack, LaunchDarkly, and Vanguard and more across a range of industries. This is an exciting time in our trajectory, weâ€™ve closed Series D funding, scaled past the 150-person mark, and were named to Forbesâ€™ Americaâ€™s Best Startups of 2022 and 2023!!

  

Youâ€™ll be joining a brand new internally focused engineering team, that will be enabling developers across the company to be more effective. This team will primarily focus on supporting front end development owning the design system, choosing tools, and building tools as needed to allow everyone to move faster and with more accessibility. If you want to know more on what Dev Experience teams bring to the table, please check out this article, as well as our thoughts on Platform Engineering.

  

 **Who We Are**

We come for the impact, and stay for the culture! Weâ€™re a talented, opinionated, passionate, fiercely inclusive, and responsible group of bees. We have conviction and we strive to live our values every day. We want our people to do what they truly love amongst a team of highly talented (but humble) peers.

  

**How We Work**

We are a remote-first company, which means we believe it is not where you sit, but how you deliver that matters most. We invest in our people and care about how you orient to our culture and processes. At the same time we imbue a lot of trust, autonomy, and accountability from Day 1. #LI-Remote

  

 ** _We can hire for this role in the United States and Canada._**

### What Youâ€™ll Do In the Role:

  *  **Make meaningful decisions in an ambiguous space.** You will drive the foundational work and roadmap for this new team. With the support of your team and the larger organization, you can be creative in your problem-solving, experiment carefully, and suggest novel solutions. Youâ€™ll also help others navigate the landscape of new technologies, guiding technology choice, and adoption of best practices.
  *  **Lead and contribute to the delivery of quality software.** You will write code across the full application stack, primarily in React and TypeScript. Youâ€™ll deliver impactful code that is well-tested to maintain a high level of code quality without spending an ever-growing amount of time maintaining those tests. You will also plan and lead these complex, multi-team, or system, long-term projects, including ones with external dependencies while collaborating with design and other engineering teams.
  *  **Support other engineers within the team and beyond.** As a technical leader, youâ€™ll have opportunities to mentor other engineers as they build their skills. Youâ€™ll pair, review code, and communicate daily with your team, give and receive thoughtful feedback on Pull Requests as you work in our shared code repositories, and act as a multiplier who shares knowledge and delegates to help others grow. 
  * **Partner closely with design and bring a strong product mindset.** This team needs to take a curious, product approach to the issues other engineering teams are facing. A strong candidate would have experience wearing the product hat, or working closely with product managers. Bonus points for being familiar with triad-based collaboration and the methodologies of product leaders like Marty Cagan and Jeff Patton. This team will be working extremely closely with design, so they would also be familiar with modern UX and product design techniques, and bring empathy for designers â€” and internal engineers.
  *  **Build and deliver quality software.** You will write code across the full application stack, primarily in Typescript and React. While most of your time will be focused on delivering software, you will be trusted to model best practices, lead team-level projects, and weigh in on larger technical decisions.
  *  **Support our software/systems in production.** We believe in owning the software that we build. The ownership is built through defining our own team KPIs, product SLOs, and alerting. Every engineer on the team participates in an on-call rotation to support issues that our customers encounter (reactive) and to look for other areas of toil that our customers may face (proactive).
  *  **Pair program with other engineers.** Our team is fully distributed across multiple time zones, and we regularly use pair programming to build our solutions. Pairing is not required for every change but is a tool we use to help reduce knowledge silos and encourage strong communication.
  *  **Learn new ways to solve complex problems.** As our company and product grow, we regularly face new challenges in scaling to meet our customersâ€™ demands. You will learn new technologies as we look for new ways to use our databases, caches, and streams to optimize for this growth.

### What Youâ€™ll Bring:

  *  **Deep experience in web/frontend application development.** You are familiar with the challenges common with browser applications and have a sense of how to balance risks and engineering efforts and are open to learning the specific languages, skills, and technologies we use by working here.
  *  **A strong sense of teamwork.** You have worked on teams requiring collaboration with other engineers and cross-functional partners, such as product managers and designers. You look for opportunities to reduce knowledge silos and level up the team members around you. You enjoy pair programming and helping others when they are stuck.
  *  **Can balance engineering investment with customer value.** Itâ€™s easy to get caught up in building a perfectly polished solution and lose the context of the value you are delivering. You have experience revisiting scope and working in small iterations to quickly put features in customersâ€™ hands.
  *  **A flexible mindset.** The urgency of product delivery within a growing business sometimes requires us to alter our strategies or roadmap. You have an open mind and are comfortable pivoting when necessary to meet the company's or customers' needs.
  *  **A strong sense of teamwork.** You have experience working with a cross-functional team. This team will work closely with design, other engineering teams, and the product managers for those other teams. You will collaborate with these partners, beginning with problem discovery through solution design and delivery. We work through building small changes/experiments and then iterate based on customer interaction.
