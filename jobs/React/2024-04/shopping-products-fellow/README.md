### The Role

### We want to hear from you!

 **BuzzFeed is looking for shopping- and products-focused writers for three-month, full-time fellowship roles. This is a paid position (starting at $18/hour). The Fellowship allows candidates to work fully remotely in select locations, but we also have monthly in-office days in our New York office for those who live locally. BuzzFeed's shopping section is an expanding editorial endeavor that includes both service-oriented and entertaining content for a shopping-minded audience (see our ‚ÄúShopping‚Äù page for examples).**

The deadline to apply for this Fellowship is **April 26th, 2024 by 5 PM EST, but applications are being considered on a rolling basis**. All application materials will need to be submitted when you apply. **The intended (and tentative) start date for this Fellowship is June 10th, 2024.**

The BuzzFeed Shopping & Products Fellowship is a program for aspiring and hungry writers eager to hone their skills, and to learn by doing. The program is a crash course in how to help our audience discover deals and great products through themed roundups and more.

You should have enough shopping knowledge to discover and share products and deals, and enough of a low-key (or high-key) internet obsession to quickly find, drive, and react to current trends. You‚Äôre just as comfortable writing about a product you love yourself as digging into reviews to find out which viral skincare products actually work or unearthing quirky kitchen gadgets people haven‚Äôt seen before.

Fellows will work with and learn from members of the BuzzFeed Shopping team. You won‚Äôt be running errands for senior staff, or transcribing someone else‚Äôs interviews, you will be pitching ideas, brainstorming, collaborating on non-writing projects, and writing dozens of stories that will be published to BuzzFeed.com and promoted across our social channels. The Fellowship is fun and inspiring, but also fast-paced and challenging.

### You Will

  * Research products in various categories and price points that are of interest to the BuzzFeed audience.
  * Write and edit shareable, unique and/or service-forward product roundups as well as SEO-friendly shopping guides or reviews.
  * Track and analyze your posts using affiliate analytics.

### You Have

  * Genuine love for the internet and online shopping
  * Firm understanding of the BuzzFeed audience and voice
  * Strong attention to detail
  * Ability to handle critical feedback and improve from it
  * Flawless spelling, grammar, and usage in your writing
  * A positive, curious, playful disposition with a sense of humor

 **Please submit the following when applying to be a Shopping & Products Fellow:**

  * Instead of a formal cover letter, please discuss your shopping habits (for example: what do you always buy in-store vs. online, how do you find a good deal, what ~special tricks~ do you use that most people don‚Äôt know about, etc.)
  * Tell us about a couple of products you‚Äôre obsessed with
  * Create a BuzzFeed.com/community profile, and create 2 shopping posts (if doing a roundup, no more than five products are needed). When you submit your posts, include ‚Äú _This is for the Shopping & Products Fellowship_.‚Äù in the description. You‚Äôll be asked to provide the links to your posts when you complete the application. **_SO, PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR COMMUNITY POSTS BEFORE COMPLETING THIS APPLICATION!_** ** _We encourage you to check_** buzzfeed.com/shopping ** _to see examples of posts that are connecting with people._**
  * Attach a resume ‚Äî keep it to one page!

The deadline to apply for this Fellowship is **April 26th, 2024 by 5 PM EST, but applications are being considered on a rolling basis**. All application materials will need to be submitted when you apply. **The intended (and tentative) start date for this Fellowship is June 10th, 2024.**
