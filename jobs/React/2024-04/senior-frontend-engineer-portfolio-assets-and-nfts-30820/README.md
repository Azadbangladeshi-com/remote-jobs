Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with ConsenSys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. ConsenSys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.
