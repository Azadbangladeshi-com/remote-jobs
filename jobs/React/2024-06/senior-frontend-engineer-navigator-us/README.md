# [Senior Frontend Engineer - Navigator (US)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-frontend-engineer-navigator-us)  
### Addepar  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote, USA`  

#### **The Role**

The Navigator team at Addepar is growing!

Navigator is a quantitative liquidity risk projection tool that is one of the key components of Addepar's multi-product ecosystem. Brought into the Addepar family as part of an acquisition in 2021, Addepar has continued to double down on investing in this critical add-on, as we've scaled well beyond the multi-million ARR goal first set for this product line.

As we continue to scale, a need has opened up for a Senior Frontend Engineer who would bring to bear their unique expertise with the existing Engineering team, with exciting opportunities to extend the scope for this role longer term, as the product continues to push onward into future global expansion mode.

Addepar takes a market-based approach to pay. A successful candidateâ€™s starting pay will be determined based on the role, job-related skills, experience, qualifications, work location, and market conditions. The range displayed on each job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target base salary for roles in Colorado, California, and New York.

The current range for this role is $125,000 - $195,000 (base salary) + bonus + equity + benefits.

Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process. Additionally, these ranges reflect the base salary only, and do not include bonus, equity, or benefits.

#### **What Youâ€™ll Do**

  * Collaborate multi-functionally with product owners, designers, GTM teams, program managers and other Engineering team members to deliver for our clients.
  * Conceive of, develop, and deliver novel solutions within a sophisticated and rich domain area. Learn and develop your career within a particularly challenging and growing part of the financial industry.
  * Build both within the primary Navigator application and in other parts of Addepar's product ecosystem, bridging shared concerns for our clients across multiple product areas, with an investor-focused viewpoint.

#### **Who You Are**

  * At least 3+ years of React experience, with ideally enough experience to have worked in both older and newer versions of the library.
  * A strong, hands-on technical approach; a desire to demonstrate your technical expertise, and to focus and improve the abilities of those on your team.
  * 3-5+ years of experience as a professional software engineer, focused on frontend systems
  * An ideal candidate will bring a background of building and scaling finance software within a product-focused, technology-forward organization.
