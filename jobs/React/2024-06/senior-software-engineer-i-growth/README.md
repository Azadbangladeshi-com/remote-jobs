**Why SurveyMonkey? Weâ€™re glad you asked**  
SurveyMonkey is a place where the curious come to grow. Weâ€™re building an inclusive workplace where people of every background can excel no matter their time zone. At SurveyMonkey, we weave employee feedback into everything we do to create forward-looking benefits policies, employee programs, and an award-winning culture, including best workplace for parents, our annual holiday refresh, our annual week of service, and our C.H.O.I.C.E Fund. In addition, weâ€™ve reimagined the way we work to allow employees to choose what works best for them -- working in-person, fully remote, or a hybrid model that combines the two through our Choice Model.

We celebrate the unique differences of our employees because that is what drives curiosity, innovation, and the success of our business.
