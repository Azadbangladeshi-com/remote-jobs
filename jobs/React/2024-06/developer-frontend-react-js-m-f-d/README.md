### **Company Description**

 ** _Who are YOU?_**

Rigilog was created more than 20 years ago to realize software support for bespoke clothing in mass production. From this starting point efficient systems quickly emerged for companies that provide uniforms and equipment to their employees and automate all processes in this environment. Today we are a team of 15 colleagues who develop software with passion and love our relaxed corporate culture, in which everyone can have a stake in the decision making process.

###  **Job Description**

 ** _What would be my tasks in the team?_**

Your focus will be on frontend development and middleware connections as well as test development. The following languages and types of communication are used for this:

  * Development with React.js and React Hooks
  * Understanding and implementing MobX for managing the state
  * Solid knowledge in HTML5 / CSS3 / CSS Preprocessors (Sass) / JavaScript / AJAX for client-based needs, requests or enhancements
  * frontend design of our successful LogiX software
  * independent implementation of smaller projects and team play for larger ones
  * Learn from experienced colleagues and pass on your own knowledge
  * and, and, and, ...!

 ** _What is expected from ME?_**

  * You have great development skills, but are you also full of ideas that are easy to implement?
  * Would you like to realize your own projects and be allowed to decide for yourself?
  * You also like to work together in a team on larger projects?
  * Are you looking for a technology-savvy company that challenges and supports you in the long term?

Then support our team! We are not looking for career types who prefer to work rather with their elbows than their heads, but for nice colleagues who like challenges, love to work independently, like to laugh and are committed to helping.

###  **Qualifications**

 ** _Which qualifications should I bring?_**

First and foremost, you should be able to develop software and already have some years of experience with the conception and development of web applications.

We donâ€™t require diplomas or degrees, but we are looking for practical experience. By the way, your future colleagues have partly completed a job training (e.g. IT specialist), partly have a degree (computer science, business informatics ...) and some are also career changers. In addition to the training, we traditionally place a high value on personal development. We follow the philosophy that very good business software must be user friendly, so we focus more and more on UX.

 ** _Therefore: If you are experienced in software development, come on board_**
