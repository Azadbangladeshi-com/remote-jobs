### Come Build With Us

We're looking to add an experienced frontend engineer to our team. There's an opportunity to have a big impact at this early stage, not only on the core product but also on the culture and direction of the company. We're looking for someone who's comfortable going outside their comfort zone and wearing many different hats.

### What You'll Do

  * Design, architect, and build Standard Metricsâ€™ core product as a member of the engineering team
  * Take ownership of entire outcomes, and continue to support and grow them through iteration, documentation, and bug fixes (we do not have a QA team)
  * Collaborate with the product team in scoping and defining the features that will best help the company achieve the outcomes aligned with our goals and the values we believe in
  * Be an active contributor to the company culture and future hiring efforts

### What You'll Bring

  * 6+ years of frontend development
  * Strong record of building and delivering web applications in React and/or Typescript required
  * Expertise with complex state management (zustand, redux, mobx, etc.)
  * Experience with building and maintaining internal component library
  * Understanding and adherence to modern software development practices (gitflow, continuous integration, peer reviews, etc.)

For international roles, we aim to pay top of market for your country. The estimated annual salary for this role is between $180,000-$225,000, plus a competitive equity package.
