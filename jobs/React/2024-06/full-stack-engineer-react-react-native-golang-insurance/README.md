 **Hi! We're UW.** Weâ€™re on a mission to take the headache out of utilities by providing them all in one place. One bill for energy, broadband, mobile and insurance and a whole lot of savings!

**The challenge**

For our customers and Partners, UW just needs to work â€“ there when you need it, and invisible when you donâ€™t. Just like flicking a switch.  
  
Our proposition to customers is simple, but for our technology teams, the behind-the-scenes complexity is what makes it so interesting. Learn more about life in our Tech teams here.

**We put people first. Itâ€™s all about you..**

The ideal candidate is someone who, regardless of their preference for back-end or front-end development, possesses the desire and ability to work on both. They should be comfortable supporting complete product initiatives by seamlessly transitioning between back-end ( **Golang, Kafka, PostgreSQL, AWS, Terraform** ) and front-end tasks ( **React Native, React, Redux** ).

**We work together. Your team and the people you will work withâ€¦**

We work in small, fully autonomous teams that have real ownership of their products. We use the best tool for the job and constantly look for better.

The Insurance team is in charge of creating, maintaining and supporting insurance products in Utility Warehouse. We currently have more than 130k live policies across multiple Insurance products, and the percentage of UW customers who hold an insurance policy with us keeps growing! Home Insurance, Boiler and Home Emergency Cover are meant to give peace of mind with our customer's most important asset! We have a small and mighty team across front-end and back-end and use a range of technologies, with event-driven architecture as our core.

**We deliver progress. What youâ€™ll do and how you will make an impact.**
