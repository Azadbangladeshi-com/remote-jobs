# [Backend Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/backend-engineer-109467)  
### Wonders  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote, US`  

**About Us:**

Here at Wonders we build products that empower small brick and mortar restaurants by liberating them of the operational burden of running their business. We accomplish this by providing a frictionless connection between them and their customers through our multi-product ecosystem offering AI-enabled order taking, delivery enablement, payment solutions, and point-of-sale software. At Wonders, we use a combination of bits (technology) and atoms (people) to solve real world problems facing small business owners.

We obsess over placing our customers first and working backwards from there. When our customers succeed, we succeed. The restaurant industry in the US is over a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM), but remains relatively underserved by technology. Large chains are able to afford expensive tech that gives them a huge advantage; we believe that small restaurant owners deserve access to the same technologies at an affordable price.

Wonders has been profitable for nearly a decade and seen 5x revenue growth in the last three years. As of our last fundraising round in mid-2022, we were valued at $450M and have since seen substantial growth across customer acquisition, product development and company headcount. Thousands of loyal restaurants have entrusted Wonders with their success, and together we have supported nearly 20 million customers. We are proud to be named one of Built Inâ€™s top companies to work for in 2023.
