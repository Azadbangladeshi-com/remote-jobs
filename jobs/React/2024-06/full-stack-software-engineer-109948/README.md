### Amenities Health  
#### `🌎 Remote,Dallas, TX`  

### **Company Description**

Amenities is the Digital Membership Platform for healthcare. The US healthcare system is a billion dollar industry and is modeled around providing care at a hefty expense. And yet, most healthcare experiences are awful and loyalty hardly exists in this industry.

Our mission is simple: build loyalty. _Amenities Health_ helps large US health systems to (1) acquire new patients, (2) modernize their tools and (3) win patient loyalty. We build white labeled products & membership services designed to lock-in loyalty (think Amazon Prime or Costco memberships).

At Amenities, you’ll be surrounded by experienced industry leaders and driven technology experts paving the paradigm shift in healthcare, including:

  * CEO is ex-McKinsey, MD, 2nd time founder, & former digital health executive.
  * Product team responsible for the industry-leading patient portal (3M accounts, 80% patient adoption, and 700k monthly users).
  * Engineering team includes former founders, ex-Cerner, ex-Epic, and more.

Our company values are:

  * Go big, little fixes won’t cut it
  * Delighting members is really smart business
  * Hire clever, motivated people, and trust them to figure it out
  * We do our best work when healthy, rested, and connected

As we experience tremendous market demand for our product and on the heels of a successful Series A funding round, we're actively growing the team across sales, marketing, product, engineering, design, and customer success functions.
