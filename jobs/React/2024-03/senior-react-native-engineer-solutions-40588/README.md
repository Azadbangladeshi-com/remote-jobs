#### `ðŸ’° 308000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

ev.energy set up in 2018 with a simple aim - to make electric vehicle charging simpler, greener, and cheaper for everyone. Drivers download our app and charge their vehicle overnight; and, in the background, weâ€™re ingesting real-time data and using our proprietary smart-charging algorithm to align charging sessions with energy from renewable sources. This reduces carbon emissions caused by EV charging by as much as 70%.

This is a growing industry, with growing demand for our solution - a third of new cars by 2030 will be electric. Simultaneously, thereâ€™s increasing strain on the power grid (power outages have already jumped by 64% in the last decade in the USA). We are already working with over 30 utilities in the US, Canada and Europe, offering a way to reduce demand on the grid.

To achieve this weâ€™ve brought together a team of over 100 people, bringing expertise from previous roles at National Grid, Tesla, Amazon, Arcadia, and Chargepoint; weâ€™ve secured over 50m USD from leading VCs in the automotive and energy space including National Grid Partners, WEX Venture Capital, Energy Impact Partners and JLRâ€™s InMotion Ventures. Come help us drive change for the better.

### The Role

Do you love coding as much as you love meeting new people? We're looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Solutions team - this team work closely with our clients (utility companies like Con Edison; EVSE manufacturers) to understand their problems, and architect solutions to solve these problems using our platform.  
  
**What will you be doing?**

  * Working closely with prospective and existing clients and partners (utility companies and EVSE manufacturers) to understand their problems and architect solutions to solve these effectively using our platform 

  * Working daily with TypeScript and React Native on our app, and with React on client web portals 

  * Collaborating closely with other members of the team day to day (Engineering, Commercial, Product) 

### What are we looking for?

  * Excellent experience with TypeScript, React Native and React, ideally with experience of React Navigation, Redux and React Query, as well as RESTful APIs

  * Numerous years of experience developing customer-facing React Native apps for iOS and Android 

  * Previous experience working on white labelled solutions is helpful but not essential 

  * Comfort working in a remote, distributed team in a fast-paced environment 

  * Excellent communication skills - you'll be comfortable talking to engineers, product folk and salespeople alike, and be proficient in communicating the technical to non-technical teams

  * Interest in the product - you'll either be excited about EVs or enthusiastic about having a positive impact on the environment

### How will we support you?

  * Work remotely and work well - we'll provide the tools you need to do your best (including a Macbook Pro), and can provide access to co-working spaces

  * Access to conferences, meet-ups and training through our L&D allowance

  * A structured career progression framework and advancement opportunities

  * Great benefits - including health insurance, 401(k) or pension, paid parental leave 

  * Annual team gatherings - in previous years the whole company has spent a week together in London, Bath and Manchester in the UK 

If you donâ€™t have all of the requirements, but youâ€™re really interested in what weâ€™re doing, please apply anyway and we can consider your application now and in future! We value applicants regardless of their background or years of experience. We'll also do our best to accommodate reasonable adjustments to the interview process if needed.
