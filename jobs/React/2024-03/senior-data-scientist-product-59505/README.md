Description

In the 1950s, Norman Borlaug embarked on an effort to breed a new type of wheat that was disease resistant and had higher yields. In the outskirts of Mexico City, he combined his background of agricultural research and theoretical knowledge with careful experimentation and diligent data collection to run over 6,000 experiments - and he was ultimately successful, kicking off the ‚ÄúGreen Revolution‚Äù that increased global crop yields by an estimated 44% and earned him a Nobel Prize.
