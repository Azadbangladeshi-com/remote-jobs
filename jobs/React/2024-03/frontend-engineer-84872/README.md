Description

**About Connext**

Connext is the protocol for cross-domain intents, focused on L2-L2 communication. Connext is the most secure and decentralized protocol on the market.

Connext enables any kind of user-facing interaction between blockchains at unprecedentedly low price and latency, settling via canonical bridges for the best possible security.

To allow instant bridging, Connext is using a third-party service provider (a router) who can trustlessly complete the interaction on their behalf. Routers are rewarded with fees.

Connext has a 20-people team, and was founded by Arjun Bhuptani and Layne Haber in 2018.
