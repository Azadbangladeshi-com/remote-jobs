In 1969, Katherine Johnson was tasked with calculating the flight trajectories of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. Her years of experience helped shape a backup plan featuring a one-star observation system that would allow astronauts to determine their location with accuracy. This plan became critical when the mission was aborted and charts helped set a safe path for the crew's return to Earth.

We‚Äôre looking for a leader of the Risk Data Science team to leverage their experience to build, grow and manage a team of skilled Data Scientists that enable Mercury to scale powered by the fraud controls this team helps build.
