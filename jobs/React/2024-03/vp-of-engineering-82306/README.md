Description

**About Koa Health**

Against the backdrop of decades of rising demand, mental health has never been more important. The Covid pandemic has led to a four-fold increase in mental disorders around the world, impacting individuals, companies, and communities. With no increase in the supply of clinicians, tens of millions of people are stranded today without access to care. Today, we simply donâ€™t have enough mental health clinicians to meet demand. Koa Health aims to solve the gap between demand and supply with a unique human-digital hybrid approach, built upon the best digital technology in the literature. Koaâ€™s digital assets deliver the highest quality care, measured through engagement, program completion, patient and clinician satisfaction, and clinical efficacy. Critically, Koa technology substantially increases clinician productivity, allowing our precious clinicians to treat more people. With more than fifty papers in the literature, twelve clinical trials, 26 patents, and broad and deep clinical
networks in place, we have just launched Koa Care 360 - a uniquely scalable and profitable mental health care service.

Having secured a successful and oversubscribed Series A funding totaling â‚¬30m (ca.$36M) in October 2020 and additional â‚¬20m funding in May 2022, we are currently closing our Series B round of investment, with â‚¬12M secured from our existing investors. You can read more about Koa Health on our website here. There has never been a more critical moment for the work that weâ€™re leading at Koa Health. And this is where you come in!
