Description

Flex is a growth-stage, NYC headquartered FinTech company that is creating the best rent payment experience. Itâ€™s hard to believe that itâ€™s 2024 and paying rent on time is expensive, inflexible, and difficult. Weâ€™re here to change that! Flex enables our users to pay rent throughout the month on a schedule that better fits their finances and budget. Our mission is to empower as many renters as possible with flexibility over their most significant recurring expense. After deliberately keeping a stealth profile as we built up unprecedented investor support and an enthusiastic user base, we are looking for motivated individuals to help us keep our mission growing.

In this role, you can expect to be working closely with other cross functional partners across our organization on a daily basis.

  * Youâ€™ll roll out changes to our customers in an agile manner with a delivery cadence that favors small, frequent iterations.

  * The ideal candidate will be comfortable leading scoping, design and implementation for APIs they build and can drive their production rollouts to completion with minimum oversight.

### **Key qualifications**

  * Strong computer science fundamentals 
  * Experience building scalable frontend infrastructure, SDKâ€™s, and APIâ€™s
  * A strong focus on building high quality and delightful UIâ€™s and experiences
  * Ability to write code that is accessible and compatible to our users devices
  * Experience with various architectures and tools within the React ecosystems (Hooks, Components, Context, Redux).
  * Experience leading and delivering products at a large scale without performance bottlenecks (hundreds of thousands to millions of users)
  * Write maintainable code that uses industry best practices to improve the entire software development life cycle, such as: unit testing, linting, automation.
  * Ability to write well-documented and testable TypeScript code
  * Familiarity with REST APIâ€™s and tooling across web architectures

_The national pay range for this role is $161,000-$240,000 annually. Individual compensation will be commensurate with the candidate's experience aligned with Flex's internal leveling guidelines and benchmarks._
