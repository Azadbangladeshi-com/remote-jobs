Wolt is a Helsinki-based technology company that provides an online platform for consumers, merchants and couriers.

To enable this, Wolt develops a wide range of technologies from local logistics to retail software and financial solutions – as well as operating its own grocery stores under the Wolt Market brand.

We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.

### Job Description

Are you interested in being part of building a service that is unique to the tastes of our over 20 million users? Would you like to be in the midst of it all, learning, growing, and expanding into new verticals together with us? Does working with Scala and building stuff from scratch sound like something you’d like to do? If the answers to all 3 questions are “yes”, then great news since Wolt is looking for multiple Senior Scala Backend Engineers to join different engineering teams across our Courier Group!

Courier Group consists of several amazing teams responsible for logistics optimization, logistics growth, courier earnings, supply and demand forecasting and providing top notch courier onboarding and delivery experiences. We strive to always use the latest Scala version in our services which allows us to benefit from the latest language features. So if you’re into functional programming and would like to be surrounded by like minded people, we have a lot to offer, like joining one of the following teams to start with! 🚀

**Courier Employment Team** is a brand new team with a mission to provide effective tools for managing the practicalities of courier employment. In countries like Germany Wolt, our Courier Partners are in an employment relationship with Wolt, so being able to effectively manage things like absences and working hours has a big impact on the courier experience and efficiency of the delivery platform. This is a greenfield project, so you’ll be building a beautiful product from the ground up and integrating it with external systems, like HR and payroll as well as collaborating a lot with our Courier Onboarding team. In this team the backend is beautifully powered by Scala while the frontend is built in Typescript (React) and React Native. Wolt has a very strong community around Scala, so there are good opportunities to collaborate and learn from others!

 **Courier Onboarding Team** in this ecosystem is the very first gear of the Courier Group and Wolt - it’s where everything starts for our Courier Partners as we are the ones helping them to become one! This story begins with us being able to provide work opportunities for people, so our work is not only impactful for the company, it is also meaningful for us as individuals. 💙 The projects in this team are super interesting and come with many nuances: together with your team you’ll be working on the tools needed to onboard our Courier Partners as fast and as smoothly as we can. To do that we work with Scala on the backend and React TS and React Native on the frontend. Since we work with Courier Partner onboarding within the 25 countries Wolt operates in, you’ll learn to navigate the many country-specific regulations, see how people in different countries use our system, what challenges there are that we can solve, and, at the end of the day, figure out how can we make our operations
team’s life easier.

📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Stockholm, or Berlin or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia.

### Qualifications

👉 You have solid experience designing, building, and integrating quality software (microservices) in modern Scala on a large scale within a complex domain.

👉 You have strong technical leadership skills.

👉 You have knowledge of AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, observability (Data Dog or similar tools) and data storages, both SQL and noSQL databases.

👉 Your stakeholder management skills are excellent.

👉 You’re a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.

👉 You’re comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances.

### Additional Information

💯 Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 800 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.

💙 You’ll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.

🙌 Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie.
