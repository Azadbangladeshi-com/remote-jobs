**Company overview:**

Hi üëã we‚Äôre Clerkie, a fintech startup based in SF. We‚Äôre a team of nearly 30 spread across the country, and we‚Äôre on a mission to help Americans get out of debt.

The consumer debt crisis is at an all-time high ($17T) and most Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck. When people fall into debt, it‚Äôs typically driven by scenarios outside of their control, and for many families, it can be incredibly difficult to navigate. We‚Äôre here to help Americans manage their debt and give them the tools to succeed. We work closely with borrowers to help triage their financial situation, increase their credit score, and automatically negotiate their outstanding debts. We provide powerful and innovative tooling to both consumers and creditors to streamline repayment through the next generation of financial tooling.

Clerkie launched in 2018 and has significant financial backing from leading financial and venture institutions like Citi, Left Lane Capital, Wellington Ventures, Flourish Ventures, and Vestigo Ventures.

**Culture:**

Every day, we obsess about how we can provide the best possible experience and outcome for our users. Our goal is to create a lasting business, one that uses true innovation to rethink the financial journey for Americans.

We‚Äôre a group of hard-working professionals who are located across the US - 4 different time zones! We have a customer-first mindset and an appetite for getting stuff done. We‚Äôre looking for a rock star Frontend Engineer to help us deliver life-changing solutions to those who need them most. üí™
