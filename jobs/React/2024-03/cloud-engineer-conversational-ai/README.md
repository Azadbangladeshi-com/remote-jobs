#### `ðŸŒŽ Greece`  

### About us

A visionary combination of technology and art, Omilia is now home to solution architects, engineers, developers, linguists, and individuals that synergize and combine their expertise and passion to one goal; deliver unfeigned human experience through virtual communication. Omilia was recognized as a Leader in the 2022 GartnerÂ® Magic Quadrantâ„¢ for Enterprise Conversational AI Platforms.

### The Role

We are looking for an Experienced Cloud Engineer with some Cloud platform experience. This individual will be responsible for designing, operating and maintaining production clusters and collaborate with other team members to develop automation strategies and deployment processes.

Your goal will be to become an integral part of the team, making every challenge of the platform â€“ your own challenge, and solving them accordingly.

 _ **The position is fully remote.**_

### Responsibilities:

  * Support & expand â€“ Maintain our AWS and Azure hosted infrastructure. You'll need to monitor and proactively plan and configure aspects of the infrastructure, as well as liaising with other parties both internal and externally to improve our performance and improve reliability. As you would expect with a role such as this, when situations arise you may need to react to outages outside the business day, to either deal with an issue or act as an escalation point;
  * Thinking out of the box and anticipate challenges â€“ It is imperative we are not simply reactive, we must expect challenges and question technologies, procedures and thinking already in place, you will be expected to constantly review and challenge at all levels;
  * Eager to learn â€“ You have expertise with what you've worked on and an eagerness to learn where you haven't worked before. Today we rely heavily on AWS, Azure, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI, Jenkins and Terraform, as well as a great number of additional applications for functions such as monitoring and networking. We are however always open to new tools & techniques to get the job done more effectively;
  * Versatile â€“ We work with agile/lean methods. We'd much rather iterate and learn than assume we know all the answers;
  * Engineering excellence â€“ Constantly looking for new ways to improve our infrastructure and leverage the capabilities AWS, Azure (and others if needed) provide us with;
  * Team player â€“ You don't (always) work in isolation and are excited by the thought of using your team whilst involving product, experience design, engineering and more in the process.

### Requirements

  * Bachelor's Degree or MS in Engineering or equivalent;

  * 2+ years of working experience in similar role;
  * Experience in operating a container orchestration cluster (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm);
  * Experience with AWS;
  * Experience with Continuous Integration tools (Gitlab CI, Jenkins, Argo CD);
  * Experience with Terraform;
  * Strong scripting skills (Bash, Python or Go);

### Will be considered as a plus:

  * Experience with Cloud Security Services.
  * Experience in Linux Administration (RedHat, CentOS);
  * Working knowledge in Configuration Management tools (Ansible);

### Basic RDBMS knowledge (MySQL, Postgres);

Basic NoSQL knowledge (Redis);

  * Telephony knowledge (SIP,VoIP);
  * Experience with ELK;

### Benefits

  * Fixed compensation;
  * Long-term employment with the working days vacation;
  * Development in professional growth (courses, training, etc);
  * Being part of successful cutting-edge technology products that are making a global impact in the service industry;
