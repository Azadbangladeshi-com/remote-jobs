Description

## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies‚Äîfrom the world‚Äôs largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups‚Äîuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone‚Äôs reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

The Stripe Dashboard is the primary way that merchants manage their Stripe accounts with a web browser. The UI Components and Patterns team is making the Dashboard‚Äôs UI and UX more consistent, accessible, mobile responsive, and modern. We‚Äôre doing this by building and establishing Dashboard-wide patterns that we and other teams use, and by creating and updating platform-level UI components. Our team is composed of engineers and designers. We‚Äôre primarily remote, and distributed throughout North America.

## **What you‚Äôll do**

As a frontend engineer on the UI Components and Patterns team, you‚Äôll build platform-level components, patterns, and guidelines for the Stripe Dashboard, elevating the experience for every merchant. By creating and expanding these platform capabilities, you‚Äôll make the page-to-page and product-to-product experience in the Dashboard more consistent, accessible, mobile responsive, and modern. And on top of that, you‚Äôll accelerate other teams at Stripe by enabling them to focus on their unique goals without needing to think about platform-level concerns.

You‚Äôll work with engineers and designers across many teams to identify new opportunities to improve and expand the Dashboard‚Äôs capabilities. We ‚Äúraise the floor‚Äù for ourselves and the rest of Stripe. Our team emphasizes high-polish user experiences, data-driven decision making, and iterative development.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Design, build, roll out, and maintain UI components and patterns that other teams rely on
  * Ensure our UI components and patterns are consistent, accessible, mobile responsive, and flexible
  * Plan and execute against short-term and long-term goals
  * Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation
  * Partner with other teams to understand and solve for their needs while considering the bigger picture
  * Teach and mentor others; as a senior member of the team, you will be looked to for guidance

## **Who you are**

We‚Äôre looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * You have 5+ years of professional, hands-on, frontend software development experience
  * You are an expert at building consistent, accessible, and responsive web UIs using React, TypeScript, and CSS
  * You have excellent oral and written communication
  * You are motivated by solving hard problems, and measure your success in terms of impact doing so
  * You thrive in a collaborative environment involving engineers, designers, and other teams to identify high-impact ways of solving problems quickly

### **Preferred qualifications**

  * You strive for simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have a good intuition for what will last and scale well
  * You have experience designing and building experiences that work elegantly across commonly used browsers and devices
  * You can put yourself in the shoes of your users to understand their needs and fit that into the bigger picture
  * You have experience building or extending a design system
  * You value and prioritize great documentation
