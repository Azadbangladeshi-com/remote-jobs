When hiring, we look for candidates who can thrive in our culture of trust, feedback, and rapid growth. We believe that diversity and inclusivity are essential to our success, and we provide equal employment opportunities regardless of background or identity. Our opportunities support remote, hybrid, or onsite work at our offices in New York City, San Francisco, or Silicon Valley, and we're dedicated to creating an environment where all employees can do their best work and contribute to the growth of our platform.

OpenSea is the largest decentralized application on Ethereum by user traffic, serving millions of users every month. Design Engineers straddle the line between being both technical contributors and product / brand designers â€” they specialize in producing extremely polished, delightful interactions and experiences that make static designs come to life.. This is a unique, specialized role with a mandate to bolster frontend engineering efforts across all of our products, improve core design system implementation & consistency, and act as a close collaborator (and often direct contributor) to the design process.

### Responsibilities

  * Work with design & frontend engineering teams to realize static designs into product experiences that have delightful interactions & polish with exceptional code quality, performance, and detail orientation.

  * Collaborate closely with designers by bringing a technical perspective to refining static design output and often directly contributing design concepts.

  * Improve and elevate core design system components and evangelize their consistent usage in OpenSeaâ€™s products.

  * Design and develop interactive marketing collateral such as landing pages in order to elevate OpenSeaâ€™s brand presence. 

### Desired Experience

  * At least 4+ years in software engineering with an evident focus on Frontend Engineering

  * ### Fluency in React, Next.js, and Tailwind.

  * Extreme design-oriented detail orientation and demonstrably good sense of craft.

  * Familiarity with best practices in crafting web animations & interactions

  * Opinionated, autonomous, and proactive â€” you donâ€™t wait to be told what to do. Fluency with programming in one of either JavaScript or TypeScript

  * Familiarity or experience with blockchain tech not strictly required, but a strong genuine curiosity & enthusiasm for the technology is required

The base salary for this full-time position, which spans across multiple internal levels depending on qualifications, ranges between $160,000 to $275,000 plus benefits & equity.
