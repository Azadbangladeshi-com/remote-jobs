Netflix has been changing the way people watch shows and movies and we've built a global Content Delivery Network called Open Connect, which sets the standard for video delivery.

Building Open Connect required the effort of a truly global team representing a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, cultures and personalities. We are looking to add to the engineering team responsible for building the Open Connect Control Plane:

  * Load-balancing algorithms for optimizing hardware utilization

### We spend our time trying to answer questions like these:

  * How do we design our systems to react to failure, internet traffic shifts, and other changes in real-time?
  * How do we steer traffic for Live delivery over the backbone?
  * How do we best predict the most popular content in order to improve the customer experience?
  * What is the optimal way to pack petabytes of content into our machines to optimize their throughput?
  * How should we design our streaming hardware given customer behavior?
  * How do we pick the best server for every Cloud Game session?

### We are looking for a software engineer who identifies with the following:

  * You like to build software and tools that help your teammates do their jobs better.
  * You have a penchant to invest in our technology so that we can stay agile.
  * You are comfortable with ambiguity.

  * Experience in a microservice environment

### Nice To Have:

  * Basic background in networking concepts
  * Distributed Systems experience at scale
  * Big Data Experience (e.g. Hive, Spark, Presto, etc.)

Netflix is a global company with a diverse member base, which is why the content we produce reflects that: global perspectives and global stories. As we grow globally, we must have the most talented employees with diverse backgrounds, cultures, perspectives, and experiences to support our innovation and creativity. We are an equal-opportunity employer and strive to build balanced teams from all walks of life.

Our culture is unique, and we tend to live by our values, so itâ€™s worth learning more about Netflix here.

To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $100,000 - $720,000
