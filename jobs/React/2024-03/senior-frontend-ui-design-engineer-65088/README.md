Our mission is to make peopleâ€™s money work for them â€” making it easier to hold, move and earn with your money, on your terms, than ever before. Our end vision challenges what people expect from money itself.

We believe crypto is simply a better way to hold and move money. We build products like Beam to make that a reality and make it accessible to people. Beam is the fastest way to onboard into crypto and send money globally â€” from anywhere, to anyone, instantly, without limits. Killer features like auto bridging, auto routing and Super send (ask us!) push the boundary of what crypto enables and just how powerful the user experience can be.

We remain active in its community, building future products and upgrades for the protocol. We continue to build one of the most selective teams in crypto, chasing one of its most ambitious visions.

We're on a mission to make your money work better for you. If youâ€™re interested in crypto, motivated by working on complex and important challenges that matter to everyone, and want to be part of a world-class team building market-leading products, we want to hear from you!
