### DevOps Engineer at Rarible

🚀 Join Us in Pioneering the Web 3 Era

We are actively shaping the future by developing robust infrastructure, bridging gaps, and crafting solutions to benefit global communities.

🛠 **Role Overview**

As our DevOps Engineer, you'll support in our transition to more scalable and cloud-based infrastructure while ensuring we meet all SLAs, SLOs, and keep the budget low.

### The challenge:

We aim to transition from partial bare metal to cost-effective Cloud, from low automation to full Infrastructure as Code (IaC), from having the DevOps Engineer as a bottleneck to empowering developers, and from plain CI to GitOps. Your contribution to this roadmap is highly valued.

Our current stack includes: LXC and QEMU VMs on top of bare metal in our DC or Hetzner, Kubernetes (for applications), nginx, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Jenkins, SOPS, Ansible, and a bit of Terraform.

 **Ideally** , this person would be open to hybrid working at our office in Lisbon, but we are also open to candidates who wish to work remotely.

💼 **What's On Your Plate?**

  * React to tickets from development teams and alerts.
  * Contribute to the stability, scalability, and performance of the infrastructure.
  * Help identify deficiencies and propose infrastructure improvements.
  * Work on the DevOps roadmap towards more scalable and cloud-based infrastructure.
  * Monitor the health of the infrastructure, uptime SLAs, and contribute to improvements around the availability and reliability of our environments.

🔧 **Skills We Admire:**

  * Enjoy IaC and automation in general; Terraform, Crossplane, or Pulumi are your friends.
  * Love Kubernetes and Kubernetes Operators and believe that if you can orchestrate Kubernetes, then you can orchestrate MongoDB clusters in Kubernetes as well.
  * Have experience managing infrastructure in any Cloud environment.
  * Experience with Prometheus and Grafana.
  * Managed MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
  * Experience with any CI/CD tools.
  * Possess basic knowledge of Linux administration and technologies like LXC, VMs, and Docker.
