## **Why Praxent?**

We get it. You have options. Let us tell you why we‚Äôre different. Our work is changing the world of financial services. Everyday, clients arrive with big ideas for their industry. They‚Äôre experts in their field with the vision and resources you need to change everything. All that‚Äôs left is the right team to bring that vision to life. If you‚Äôre a fast learner and you love working on a wide variety of projects, you‚Äôre going to like it here. We help our clients modernize, rather than rebuild, outdated customer-facing software applications. Our clients see a return within weeks instead of months and that‚Äôs why they choose us.

At Praxent, we let you do your work your way. We‚Äôre a team of 120+ located throughout the United States and Central/South America. Our role is to encourage you, support you, and give you the freedom you need to thrive. Whether you‚Äôre working at home, in a coffee shop, or heck, even on your travels, we‚Äôre here to create an environment that lets you live your best life. On your terms.

We trust our people to be their best. It‚Äôs a level of autonomy and respect that‚Äôs helped us grow a diverse and brilliant team of experts. Experts who also happen to be some of the best colleagues you‚Äôve ever worked alongside.

This role has been categorized as a Remote position. ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù employees do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in the following locations: Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Argentina.
