Description

Role

Regrello is seeking a US-based **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** to join our small but mighty infrastructure team. In this individual-contributor role, you will be tasked with designing, automating, and monitoring our global cloud infrastructure, as well as working directly with our enterprise customers to ensure that our platform works seamlessly for their mission-critical use cases. Further, you will collaborate closely with our product and development teams, advocating for best practices and contributing to a culture of reliability and resilience. If you are a passionate builder and want to make a significant impact on both our company and a major global industry, you'll fit right in!

  

Company

 **Regrello** is a 40-person startup reimagining automation in supply chains, in which companies still communicate about $13T of annual shipments almost entirely via email. This is a $220-billion, Amazon-sized market opportunity that‚Äôs been largely overlooked for over 20 years. Our team has experience building billion-dollar companies and includes veterans from Oracle, Palantir, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Our customers include some of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world. We're funded by Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Dell, Bloomberg, and Ram Sriram (first investor in Google). With a 2-3 year runway, we offer startup agility and longer-term stability.

  

Product

We are building a global operating network that finally enables supply-chain companies to collaborate within one platform. Our **workflow engine** empowers non-technical industry experts to model their complex manufacturing and operational processes. Our **forms engine** enables unprecedented data exchange between companies. And our upcoming **AI engine** summarizes the complex goings-on across thousands of workflows, identifying inefficiencies and driving optimization as companies react to a constantly-shifting global landscape. Quote one user: ‚ÄùI‚Äôve been waiting for this for 20 years.‚Äù

  

Culture and Compensation

We are a customer-obsessed, product-driven company that is building a flexible, hybrid/remote culture to enable the brightest minds in the industry. We are particularly interested in candidates based in our hubs of Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, but we will consider candidates who live anywhere in the US, Canada, or Mexico. For this role, we are also open to considering applicants from time zones opposite North America. We have industry-leading compensation packages, including equity and health benefits. We are willing to sponsor US work authorization if needed.
