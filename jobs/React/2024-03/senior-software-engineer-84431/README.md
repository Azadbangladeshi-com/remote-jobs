As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be contributing to complex and innovative features in the Datafold application as well as help build the foundation of the Datafold platform.

Datafold empowers its users â€“ data engineers and analysts â€“ by abstracting them from the complexity of their data and automating the most tedious tasks. That requires us to solve various challenging problems under the hood.

You will partner closely with the CTO, Head of Engineering and product team to scope projects, and collaborate with other members of the engineering team to get projects shipped and solve our customersâ€™ problems. Datafoldâ€™s frontend is written in React/TypeScript, our backend in Python, and we use PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and Redis as datastores. Our product is hosted on AWS and Google Cloud.

##  **About you**
