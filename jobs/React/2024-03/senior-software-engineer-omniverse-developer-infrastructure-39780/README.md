Description

At NVIDIA, we are known world-wide for our groundbreaking GPU technologies, and our portfolio continues to expand and innovate in the areas of AI, simulation, deep learning, and more. Our technology has been redefining the art of the possible in industries like gaming, automotive, and virtual reality. Now, our vision is to create a holistic platform for 3D and digital twin collaboration and innovation through our groundbreaking Omniverse platform.

We are looking for talented and motivated Software Engineers to join our Omniverse platform development team. You will play a crucial role in ensuring the success of the revolutionary Omniverse platform by optimizing our development and release processes, creating world-class performance and quality measurement and regression management tools, and maintaining a high standard of excellence in our build system, testing frameworks and release engineering tools and processes. Develop, maintain, and improve CI/CD tools for on-prem and cloud deployment of our software, enable sophisticated cross-platform build systems, and bring world-class release engineering to NVIDIA's Omniverse platform and cloud deployment process.

 **What you will be doing:**

  * Collaborate with developers, QA, and product teams to establish, refine, and streamline our SW change management processes.

  * Analyze and optimize build and test performance for efficient resource utilization and accelerated development cycles.

  * Implement automation and continuous improvement methodologies to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in existing workflows and allow developers to ship features faster.

  * Ensure code quality by setting up and maintaining static and dynamic analysis tools.

  * Contribute to the documentation of best practices, guidelines, and procedures related to CI/CD, performance, build systems, and release engineering, particularly where AI can be used to ease workloads.

  * Stay up-to-date with industry trends and emerging technologies, and incorporate relevant innovations to improve processes and systems.

 **What we need to see:**

  * Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field.

  * 5+ years of experience with large and complex software development environments. Experience with large code bases (300k+ LoC) is a plus

  * Expert knowledge of the C++ and/or Python programming language and the Linux environment

  * Experience creating and maintaining distributed, scalable systems that are fault tolerant and reliable

  * Proficiency with popular CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis CI, CircleCI), build systems (e.g., CMake, Bazel, Gradle), and version control systems (e.g., Git, Perforce).

  * Experience with containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

  * Excellent problem-solving and debugging abilities, with strong attention to detail.

  * Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively in a fast-paced, cross-functional team.

 **Ways to stand out from the crowd:**

  * Experience with GPU-accelerated applications or technologies.
