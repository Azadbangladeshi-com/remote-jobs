### Check  
#### `üí∞ 363000.0` `üåé United States`  

Check is leading a revolution in the payroll industry. Payroll is the backbone of the US economy, and yet it has not undergone significant innovation in decades. We invented the embedded payroll space to change that _(_ see:Check: Solving the $150 Billion Payroll Problem _,_ Bank On It; Episode 438), both for the business owners who spend countless hours per week running payroll and for the millions of Americans who depend on their next paycheck. At Check, our mission is to empower the most innovative software platforms to create new payroll businesses, and enable those businesses to transform the way companies pay their employees.

Check‚Äôs culture is intensely caring: to each other as teammates, to our partners, and to the businesses and workers we serve. Our teams are made up of creative problem solvers and empathetic cross-functional collaborators who can simplify the complexities of payroll. We bring hustle and grit to our day-to-day, while building enduring solutions and relationships.

### Role Overview:

Check is hiring a full stack engineer to expand our embedded payroll platform: the intuitive APIs, delightful UIs, and product-backed services that simplify creating, growing, and running a payroll business for our partners. This is the perfect role for an engineer who wants to have an outsized business impact. Our technical stack includes Python, Django, React, TypeScript, Postgres, and AWS.

### In this role, you will:

  * Scope, develop, and lead large technical projects with significant business impact
  * Build tools that support and automate complex payroll workflows for our partners and internal teams
  * Influence the culture, values, and processes of a growing engineering team
  * Use data-driven analysis to identify opportunities to achieve our business goals
  * Provide input on product and strategic decision-making

### You may be a fit for this role if you:

  * Have a strong product/user orientation
  * Focus on iterative value delivery
  * Have led projects that simplify complex concepts through software
  * Enjoy navigating ambiguity and making decisions independently
  * Have interest in designing both frontend UIs and backend APIs
  * Love working with cross-functional stakeholders

### We use:

  * Python (type-annotated) and Django for our API
  * React and TypeScript for our frontends
  * Postgres for our database
  * AWS for our cloud infrastructure
  * GitLab for issue tracking and CI/CD

### What we offer:

At Check we value transparency and trust. It‚Äôs important to us that every employee and candidate feels confident that they‚Äôll be treated (and compensated) fairly on our team. The engineering team specifically operates on a flat titling system, meaning everyone is either a Software Engineer or an Engineering Manager. We structure our titles this way to maximize equity, inclusion and opportunity within our team, and to minimize seniority bias. We want all engineers, regardless of job level, to feel empowered to lead projects they‚Äôre passionate about and to collaborate with their fellow Checketeers _as_ _equals_.

To that end, we will consider candidates with a variety of backgrounds and levels of expertise for this role, and we will determine the appropriate job level for each candidate based on their unique experience and qualifications. The expected annual salary for this role is between $160,000 and $203,000, depending upon the job level.

In the US, Check offers company-sponsored medical, dental, vision, short-term/long-term disability and basic life insurance coverage to all full-time employees, effective on your first day of work. We also provide stock options, flexible PTO and sick leave, 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave for all new parents and flexible return-to-work, 9 annual holidays, a 401k retirement plan, and a $100 monthly stipend for home internet and mobile phone expenses. Benefits may vary outside the US.

We accept applications on an ongoing basis with no specified deadline.
