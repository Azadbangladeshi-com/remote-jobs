# [Software Engineer (React Native)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-react-native-84321)  
### Sona  
#### `üí∞ ~0k` `üåé Remote`  

Description

The real economy employs 3 billion people in frontline jobs, yet frontline teams have been underserved by technology for decades and are left to choose between paper or 20-year-old workforce management solutions, which harm both their employees and their business.

At Sona, we‚Äôre building the Frontline Operating System; an end-to-end platform to manage the entirety of a shift-based workforce. Sona combines the functionality you expect from any workforce management software - including scheduling, time & attendance, and absence management - with industry-specific plugins and dedicated features to empower staff, all in one easy-to-use platform that simplifies frontline work for everyone.

We have the opportunity to build a very large, impactful and sector-defining business, and we‚Äôre off to a fast start. In year 1, we reached tens of thousands of frontline workers and raised over $10 million from Google‚Äôs AI fund - Gradient Ventures, SpeedInvest, Notion Capital and angels like Tom Blomfield, to help us reach more.

It‚Äôs a hugely exciting time to be joining the team, as we‚Äôre still small enough that you‚Äôll have a significant impact on the company, growth trajectory and culture, but large enough that we have a great structure, experienced leaders and world-class benefits in place (such as being fully remote and flexible, and only working 4.5 days a week)

 **About the Role**

Our stack has two main components:

  * A native mobile application built in React Native + Typescript

  * A backend with a GraphQL API (for communicating with the Native App) and a web frontend built using Elixir and Phoenix Live View (the PETAL stack)

We think in terms of ‚ÄúT Shaped‚Äù developers. This means that while all of us have some ability across the ‚Äúfull stack‚Äù, most of us have one side of the stack (e.g. Elixir or React Native) we‚Äôre stronger on and spend the bulk of our time on. We're a little lighter than we'd like on React Native specialism within the team, so we're looking to rebalance with this hire.

**How we Work**

We fundamentally believe that the best products are built when small, cross-functional, autonomous teams are empowered to solve business problems as they see fit. You‚Äôll be joining a pod which owns a particular area of the product and movement between product areas is encouraged and easy.

We‚Äôre a small company with a strong preference for lightweight, asynchronous processes and within Product, we work in sprints with periodic retrospectives. Everything starts with our customers and our engineers (and wider Product team) work closely with Customer Success to ensure we‚Äôre building a product that fits our users needs. Our Product team principles give more of a flavour of how we like to work day-to-day.

 **Requirements**

Everybody‚Äôs different, but a lot of the following probably applies to you:

  * You have plenty of professional experience in React Native

  * You have a strong preference towards taking ownership, making sure you‚Äôre clear on what you‚Äôre doing and why and then communicating progress over awaiting instruction

  * You have a focus on ‚Äúgetting it shipped‚Äù and when given the choice between ‚Äúcomplicated and shiny‚Äù vs ‚Äúget something simple in front of a user‚Äù, you always choose the latter.

  * You‚Äôre in a country which is GMT +/- 3 and fluent communicating both verbally and in writing in English

  * You‚Äôre able to attend in-person company meetups 2-3 times per year, these will be around 4 days long and usually require flying both in and outside of Europe

 **Benefits:**

  * ¬£75-90k (or local equivalent), depending on experience

  * 4.5 day standard working week 

  * Share options

  * Fully remote and flexible working

  * 35 days annual leave (25 days standard plus 10 flexible public holiday days)

  * Pension contributions matched up to 5%

  * Enhanced parental leave & pay

  * Comprehensive health insurance via Bupa

  * Co-working space stipend

  * Quarterly all expenses paid team retreats

  * The latest Macbook and equipment for your home office

  * Professional development budget

  * Unlimited free books

 **Working at Sona**

We take our health and mental health seriously, believing that we can only perform to our best when we are healthy, happy, and in control of when, where, and how we work. That's why we're fully remote and everyone works a 4.5 day week (you choose when you take the half day) with a fully flexible schedule.

We balance this with regular virtual stand-ups and all-hands so we're all aligned, and paid-for, in-person meet-ups so you can get to know your colleagues.
