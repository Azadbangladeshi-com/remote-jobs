  * Talk with our fantastic designers and work with them to bring great experiences to the world.
  * Drop some knowledge on everyone about how legit frontend code is written.

**You are the one we're looking for if you:**

  * Enjoy coding across the stack, but relish those times when you get to do frontend work.
  * Designers love you and want to hang out with you all the time.
  * Amazing JavaScript code just flows out of your fingers and you love React.js more than anything!
  * You know the dark arts of how to make CSS behave.
  * Helping others is one of your favorite things to do, also laughing.
  * You've been creating dazzling web and mobile applications for 8 or more years 

**Unusual days include:**

  * Playing online games until the wee hours of the afternoon
  * Enjoying team trivia, magic shows, and team game nights!
  * Traveling to Napa and relaxing in the breeze
