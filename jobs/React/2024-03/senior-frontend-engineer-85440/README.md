### **About Argent**

Argent aims to be crypto‚Äôs _defining_ company: the first to bring the benefits of self-custody to a global audience. Giving people control of their assets and identity, and helping them to enjoy new economic opportunities.

To do this we‚Äôve built the first smart wallet. As different from traditional wallets as smart phones were to 90‚Äôs phones. Argent is easier, safer, cheaper, and greener.

As a company, we‚Äôve raised a $40m Series B from Paradigm, Index Ventures and Creandum, putting us in a strong financial position with 4 years of runway.

We work remotely across Europe, prioritizing autonomy and flexibility. And it‚Äôs a particularly exciting time to join as we‚Äôre launching new breakthrough products on Starknet.

 _‚Äúwe need wide adoption‚Äù of wallets like Argent (Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-Founder)_

    * Hito Studios, our new startup studio. We recently launched the studio in partnership with the Starknet Foundation with the aim of building and spinning out iconic consumer-facing projects. The studio will also accelerate existing, early stage Starknet projects with similar potential. We want Hito Studios to be a moonshot factory, radically changing crypto‚Äôs impact globally.

Across both you will work directly with our founders to bring transformative ideas to market.

    * At ease with design and architecture of software and systems (e.g. Design Patterns, Secure Software Development)
    * Experience with agile methodologies and software development tooling and processes

### You might also have
