#### `ðŸŒŽ Canada`  

### This role is 100% remote within Canada.

 **Who Youâ€™ll Be Joining:**

As a Web Developer on the dotcom team, you'll create an experience that serves as the company's face to its customers. You'll be responsible for an experience that guides and informs customers on their eCommerce journey as well as providing visibility and knowledge on ecobee's products and initiatives. You'll also have the opportunity to continually modernize and enhance the the dotcom platform - ensuring its maintainability and scalability with a highly collaborative team thatâ€™s passionate about Web technologies, accessibility, automation and performance.

**How Youâ€™ll Make an Impact:**

As a Web Developer, you will be continually involved in shaping the direction of what web technologies we are using and how we implement those technologies. As someone who is familiar with the ever-changing universe that is the vast and infinite Web, you'll be part of a team that has the freedom to choose their own tools for development. This freedom is encouraged through a relaxed view on coding that allows for individual expression - where everyone has a voice and every opinion is valued. Our team believes in a thoughtful and well-planned development cycle. We iterate, refactor, rewrite - in other words, no throwing code over the fence. You'll have ownership of the experiences you create, continually improving them and providing production support.

### What Youâ€™ll Bring to the Table:

  * You have your web fundamentals down pat (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) 
  * You have a high level of confidence in your JavaScript, and you have a thirst to learn and know more 
  * You're more than comfortable in Typescript, and in common web frameworks, such as but not limited to React 
  * You practice and recognize the advantages of component-based design and development 
  * You're an agilest who believes in shipping frequently and iterating as we learn and have strong time management and communication skills. 
  * You understand that the web is for everyone, and champion accessibility and inclusive design 
  * Collaboration and iteration are part of who you are, and you are willing to engage your peers in both giving and accepting constructive feedback 

**Bonus points if you are familiar with**

  * GatsbyJS or other React-based framework 
  * Contentful or other headless CMS 
  * Shopify App development 

_Just so you know: The hired candidate will be required to complete a background check._

 **What happens after you apply:**

**Application review.** It will happen. By an actual person in Talent Acquisition. We get upwards of 100+ applications for some roles, it can take a few days, but every applicant can expect a note regarding their application status.

**Interview Process:**

  * Round 1: A 45-minute phone call with a member of Talent Acquisition
  * Round 2: A 1-hour virtual interview with a pair of our engineering managers, including the engineering manager of the Dotcom team
  * Round 3: A practical take-home challenge followed by 1.5-hour virtual interview in which you'll present your solution to senior members of our Dotcom team
