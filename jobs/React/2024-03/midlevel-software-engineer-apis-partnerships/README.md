### Honeycomb  
#### `ðŸ’° ~175k` `ðŸŒŽ US,Remote`  

Description

**We can hire for this role in the United States and Canada**

  

 **What Weâ€™re Building**

Honeycomb defined the concept of observability and is raising expectations of what our developer tools can do! Honeycomb is the observability platform that enables engineering teams to find and solve problems they couldn't before. It enables engineers to answer novel questions about their ever-evolving cloud applications, so they can deploy confidently, resolve incidents faster and focus on high-value work that drives innovation. Weâ€™re working with well known companies like HelloFresh, Slack, LaunchDarkly, and Vanguard and more across a range of industries. This is an exciting time in our trajectory, weâ€™ve closed Series D funding, scaled past the 150-person mark, and were named to Forbesâ€™ Americaâ€™s Best Startups of 2022 and 2023!!

  

In the Software Engineer role, youâ€™ll join Honeycombâ€™s API and Partnerships team. From building new APIs to creating open-source API clients like Terraform & Cloudformation providers to building product integrations with partners like CircleCI, LaunchDarkly, Github, PagerDuty, etc., the team will ensure working with Honeycomb data is always within arms reach no matter what tool you are using. Lately, the team has worked on creating and exposing Honeycomb Activity Logs and started on a journey to level up our API keys and introduce programmatic management of API Keys. At the moment, these functions are only possible within the UI. Just before this, the team worked to launch two new integrations between Honeycomb<-> Microsoft Teams and Honeycomb â†” GitHub.

  

 **Who We Are**

We come for the impact, and stay for the culture! Weâ€™re a talented, opinionated, passionate, fiercely inclusive, and responsible group of bees. We have conviction and we strive to live our values every day. We want our people to do what they truly love amongst a team of highly talented (but humble) peers.

  

**How We Work**

We are a remote-first company, which means we believe it is not where you sit, but how you deliver that matters most. We invest in our people and care about how you orient to our culture and processes. At the same time we imbue a lot of trust, autonomy, and accountability from Day 1.

### What you'll do in the role:

  * **Build and deliver quality software.** You will write code across the full application stack, primarily in Go and Typescript/React. While most of your time will be focused on delivering software, you will be trusted to model best practices, lead team-level projects, and weigh in on larger technical decisions.
  *  **Collaborate with cross-functional partners.** Our team follows a product triad model composed of design, product, and engineering. You will collaborate with these partners, beginning with problem discovery through solution design and delivery. 
  * **Avoids** monolithic deliverables and breaks down complex tasks quickly. We work through building small changes/experiments and then iterate based on customer interaction. 
  * **Support our software/systems in production.** We believe in owning the software that we build. The ownership is built through defining our own team KPIs, product SLOs, and alerting. Every engineer on the team participates in an on-call rotation to support issues that our customers encounter (reactive) and to look for other areas of toil that our customers may face (proactive).
  *  **Enjoys being a generalist.** This teamâ€™s work will naturally touch multiple areas of the product to build meaningful integrations that delight our customers. The ideal candidate would probably enjoy a variety in their work and be willing to jump between creating SDKs, API surface, some UI work, documentation, and more to help the team accomplish its goals.
  *  **Loves creating a good developer experience.** Youâ€™ll be working with some of our most important product surface areas: the APIs and SDKs that allow customers to consume Honeycomb data. Youâ€™ll do well if you are the kind of engineer who enjoys thinking about how to design solutions and write code and documentation that other engineers are delighted to work with. You know how to balance developer experience against other concerns like performance, reliability, availability, etc.
  *  **Values clear, open communication and teamwork.** We see clear, thoughtful, and regular written & face-to-face communication (including a willingness to give & receive feedback) as a fundamental engineering skill and one of the strongest predictors of future engineering impact, not just a nice to have, and we hope you do too. In this role, you will also be a part of helping others maintain resilience in periods of change.

### What You'll Bring:

  *  **Experience working across an application stack.** You have experience with modern frontend and backend languages (being stronger in one is perfectly fine). You may have delivered features for which you built the UI, as well as the database migrations and API endpoints to support it.
  *  **A strong sense of teamwork.** You have worked on teams requiring collaboration with other engineers and cross-functional partners, such as product managers and designers. You look for opportunities to reduce knowledge silos and level up the team members around you. You are open to pair programming and helping others when they are stuck.
  *  **Can balance engineering investment with customer value.** Itâ€™s easy to get caught up in building a perfectly polished solution and lose the context of the value you are delivering. You have experience revisiting scope and working in small iterations to quickly put features in customersâ€™ hands.
  *  **A flexible mindset.** The urgency of product delivery within a growing business sometimes requires us to alter our strategies or roadmap. You have an open mind and are comfortable pivoting when necessary to meet the company's or customers' needs.
  *  **Act with Autonomy and Ownership.** You **** can work independently and with the team as needed and be accountable end-to-end through planning, deployment, and maintenance, showing ownership of their own work in production. You can proactively identify and suggest solutions to problems impacting the team. And you know how to create your own learning path, proactively seeking out the resources you need to level up.

### What you'll get when you join the Hive:

  * Base pay (range) of $160,000 - $175,000 USD
  * A stake in our success - generous equity with employee-friendly stock program
  * Itâ€™s not about how strong of a negotiator you are - our pay is based on transparent levels relative to experience
  * Compensation benchmarked to San Francisco market - no matter where you live (or move)!
  * 401k plan to help you plan for your future
  * A remote-first mindset and culture (really!)
  * 100% employee coverage for Health, Dental, Vision, Life and Disability insurance and 75% for dependents
  * Time to Recharge - In addition to our Unlimited PTO policy, we provide ~23 days off through out the year. This includes a company wide break at the end of the year, and we honor having at least one three day weekend a month (if there is not already a locally observed holiday that month, we add one!)
  * Pick Your Perk - $600 a year to spend on the perks that you care about most
  * Work Life Balance and Flexible Schedule options
  * The tech you need AND a $500 Home Setup Stipend
  * $200 Reimbursement for Cell/Wifi/CoWorking
  * $1500+ Annual Professional Development Allowance
  * Up to 16 weeks of paid parental leave, regardless of path to parenthood
  * Maven Inclusive Family-Building benefit including unlimited virtual appointments, coaches & counselors, and $10K â€˜walletâ€™ to support adoption, surrogacy, IVF, and egg/sperm freezing
  * Modern Health well-being benefit including self guided resources and access to 12 mental health and 8 coaching sessions - at no additional cost to you.
  * Semi-annual performance conversations (we call them Review & Rewards conversations) - so you know where you stand, and how youâ€™ll be rewarded for your impact
  * Annual compensation review, benchmarking to industry and inflation changes

 **Please note we cannot currently sponsor or do visa transfers at this time.**

  

 **Diversity & Accommodations:**

We're building a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other, and welcome nontraditional candidates, and people of all backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives. You don't need to be a millennial to join us, all gens are welcome! Further, we (of course) follow federal and state disability laws and are happy to provide reasonable accommodations during the application phase, interview process, and employment.
