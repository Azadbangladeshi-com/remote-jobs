Description

At Scribd (pronounced ‚Äúscribbed‚Äù), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

  

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

  

We love collaborating and investing time in our Scribd community, and we create intentional in-person moments with each other to build culture and connection. And, it is through our flexible work benefit ‚Äì Scribd Flex ‚Äì that we enable employees, in partnership with their manager, to choose the work-style that best suits their individual needs and preferences.

  

**About the Discovery Experience Team**

Discovery Experience is the face of Scribd‚Äôs Machine Learning and Discovery Engineering Division. It is dedicated to building the customer-facing web experience that powers our cutting-edge search, recommendations, and generative AI features. As a bridge between our innovative machine learning engineers and end-users, this team is tasked with translating complex algorithms and data-driven insights into intuitive, seamless web interfaces. Our goal is to ensure that customers interact with our product in the most engaging, effective, and enjoyable way possible.

Joining this team means you will play a key role in bringing to life the pioneering work of our data scientists and machine learning engineers, creating tangible impacts through exceptional user experiences.

  

  

 **As a Discovery Experience Engineer**

Our cross-functional squads often involve deep collaboration with other engineering teams, designers, and product managers. Your excellent communication, both ‚Äúlive‚Äù in meetings and asynchronously via slack will be a key tool in driving success.

This role predominantly focuses on the frontend but comfort and knowledge of the full tech stack is a must as this team is often responsible for working with backend engineers to build our complete product.

Full-cycle software development will be your primary function, but we'll expect you to contribute in a number of ways, including advising on others' technical design, reviewing code, participating in interviews, and mentoring less experienced engineers.

When you are building software, you'll be doing more than just coding a ticket that is handed to you. You'll contribute to the code strategy, architecture, implementation, delivery, and operation of systems, end-to-end. You'll consider testability, upgradeability, scalability, and observability throughout the development process.

### Must have skills

  * 2+ years of full time experience working on frontend systems, especially with React
  * Understanding of at least one modern JavaScript/TypeScript framework (React, etc)
  * Strong written and verbal communication skills - We're a remote company with a robust documentation (and Slack!) culture
  * A collaborative spirit, as you‚Äôll be working closely with product, design, and back-end engineers to implement features
  * Knowledge of APIs to comfortably participate in API design discussions with your server-side teammates

### Nice to have

  * Experience with Next.js
  * Experience with GraphQL
