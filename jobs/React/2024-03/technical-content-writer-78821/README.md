#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

Our everyday digital experiences are in the midst of a realtime revolution. Whether attending an event in a virtual venue, receiving realtime financial information, or working with colleagues in an online collaborative environment - consumers simply expect realtime digital experiences as standard. At Ably weâ€™re not just witnessing this revolution - weâ€™re powering it.

At the heart of our mission lies a commitment to putting developers first. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime, delivering billions of messages for millions of devices every day and supporting organizations like Split, Hubspot, Toyota and Genius Sports.

Working at Ably means helping to build the infrastructure and technology that will power and shape the future of the internet. The opportunity in front of us is immense. And weâ€™d like your help.

###  **About this role**

Ablyâ€™s Marketing team brings together product marketing, channel experts, technical writers, and growth-minded individuals to build our brand and customer-base. The opportunity to spread the word about Ably to technical decision makers (CTOs, VPs, Architects) and senior engineers through high-caliber and engaging marketing activities and technical content is what excites and motivates us each day. If you enjoy identifying new opportunities, experimenting with new ideas, and speaking to our highly-technical audience through content and campaigns then youâ€™ll love working at Ably.

As an experienced Technical Content Writer, youâ€™ll play a pivotal role in our Marketing team as we continue our growth. Whether you come from a background in DevRel, Developer Education, technical Product Marketing or youâ€™re a developer who enjoys writing content and code looking for a career change, this role offers a unique opportunity to delve into all facets of developer marketing at an exciting developer tools company.

You'll be instrumental in advocating for the developer voice in the Marketing team, sharing developer trends and insights, and making technical content a growth engine for Ably by both producing your own content, and working with internal and external content contributions to help set Ably apart.

###  **Day to day you will**

  *  **Drive technical content creation and marketing initiatives.** Youâ€™ll develop technical content and developer marketing initiatives to engage senior developers in our target segment, leaning on developer trends and your deep understanding of our audience.
  *  **Engage internal and external experts to support developer marketing initiatives.** Youâ€™ll work with the Ably engineering team, and external experts, to deliver content and activities that support developer marketing initiatives.
  *  **Work collaboratively to distribute content.** Youâ€™ll develop a deep understanding of the ways we can get our content in the right developer communities, newsletters, and websites, and work with teams across the business (including Engineering and Product) to make this happen.
  *  **Support business and marketing activities with your technical expertise.** To engage our senior developer audience, everything needs to be technically accurate - from our product landing pages, to our case studies, and campaign messaging. Therefore, we are seeking someone able to provide technical reviews, and translate technical information into messaging for the website.

###  **Weâ€™d love to hear from you if you have**

  * An understanding of developer behaviors and preferences (how they research, evaluate and purchase products) and can use that knowledge to create compelling and engaging marketing activities. Bonus points if you have experience marketing to senior engineers in scale up/enterprise businesses.
  * An awareness of the technology landscape, including both established and emerging technologies.
  * Proven experience in delivering impactful content and campaigns designed to reach technical audiences, and a portfolio to showcase your work.
  * Comfortable writing code (particularly JavaScript and React).
  * A continuous learner mindset and comfort with complex technical concepts.
  * Strong multitasking and prioritization skills.
  * Excellent verbal, written, and interpersonal communication skills.
  * Experience working in a fast-paced environment, as part of cross-functional teams.

###  **It would be nice, but not essential if you have**

  * Knowledge of serverless, event-driven and realtime technologies (e.g. Pub/Sub, WebSockets, Kafka, Server-Sent Events, MQTT, etc.).
  * Familiarity with SEO and content distribution channels.
  * Experience coordinating internal and external content resources.
  * Experience ghost writing on behalf of engineers.
  * An active presence in developer communities.
  * Experience producing video, podcast, and/or audio content.
