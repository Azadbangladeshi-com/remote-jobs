    Want to make Decentralized Finance accessible to all?
    
    DeFi enables anyone to perform jobs previously reserved to banks like market making or lending. This unlocks incredible yield opportunities for investors.

We are transitioning web2 to web3.

  * Lead frontend for an early stage startup with funding and traction

  * Utilize Typescript for both the development of the front end and the integration with a programmatically generated frontend API based on the backend schemas.

  * Work closely with product and design to continuously improve the user experience

  * Interface with all stakeholders in a company

Who you are

  * Provide a thoughtful approach to technical tradeoffs and risks

  * An advocate for test driven development and testing automation

  * Perseverance to figure out the solution to any problem you encounter

  * Capable of adding or extending an api in a backend codebase

    
    
    We are hiring extraordinary people that dream big and dare to build. We win and we do so with unwavering integrity. We are customer obsessed. We love solving hard problems. We hustle. We are owners. We are gritty and see things through to the end. We are humble and down to earth. We stick together and create an inclusive environment. Sounds like you? Join us!
