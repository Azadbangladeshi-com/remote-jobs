### Voltus  
#### `ðŸŒŽ USA`  

**About Voltus**

Voltusâ€™ mission is to be the Distributed Energy Platform that fulfills the promise of the energy transition. The Voltus platform connects any distributed energy resource (DER) to any energy market across the US and Canada, providing flexibility, reliability, and resilience to the grid while generating revenue for our partners. By partnering with industry leaders and the DER ecosystem, we are building the decarbonized, distributed, decentralized, and digitized energy system of the future.

  

Voltus is a remote and virtual company, distributed across US, Canada, and abroad. While this job is remote, you must be within 4 hours of North American Eastern Time - GMT-1 to GMT-9.

  

  

**About the Role**

As a Senior Frontend Engineer on the Applications team, you will build UIs and client-side web applications to help our team of energy market experts manage complex distributed resources in wholesale energy markets. At the same time, you will build apps to make our customersâ€™ lives easier while they get paid for using less energy.

  

You have experience with modern web development frameworks (especially React) and are comfortable working on the API layer when you need to. You have the product chops to create beautiful customer-facing tools or functional internal tools, and have the judgment to know which to build when. You are bright, gritty, and good, and you want to work with others like you.
