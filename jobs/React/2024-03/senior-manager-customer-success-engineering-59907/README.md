### About Vercel:

Vercel's Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. Vercel enables customers like Under Armour, Nintendo, The Washington Post, Porsche, and Zapier to build dynamic user experiences on the web.

At Vercel, our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products and that goes hand in hand with creating an environment where you can do the best work of your life.

### About the Role:

We are seeking to hire an experienced Senior Manager for our Customer Success Engineering (CSE) team who has a strong focus on both velocity and quality and a desire to deliver a customer experience beyond all expectations. This role inherits an existing team with a variety of experience levels with the opportunity to build out further to ensure an adequate level of coverage for our customers. You will join two other regional managers and find a set of well documented processes, policies, and expectations, although there is considerable scope and expectation to re-evaluate and simplify these, in the name of continually improving outcomes for customers alongside our efficiency.

You will be driven by working with and expanding the team with exceptional people who care deeply about providing the best customer experience and this will be reflected in your approach to hiring - world class talent that understands the right balance between digging deep and moving fast. You will focus on scaling and efficiency, identifying and implementing solutions that reduce the need for customers to contact support while building partnerships across the company that allow your team to get the help they need and finding the balance between human and technical solutions. You will understand the importance of growing a support team in such a way that it can continually improve the customer experience while not scaling linearly with incoming cases - ambitious and bold ideas are strongly encouraged.

This role is fast paced and while regular office hours will suffice most of the time, you must be prepared for flexibility during busier times or when unexpected issues arise, as such, we utilize out of hours paging where required. You will have ample support from leadership at all times, alongside other CSE managers in alternate timezones. Ultimately, the desire to deliver exceptional customer experiences at scale is what will motivate you and help you and your team achieve success through a variety of means that you will have direct influence over.

  * Identifying opportunities for tooling to improve efficiency and quality of work.
  * Overseeing the communication of incidents to customers.
  * Leading by example and periodically demonstrating CSE best practices in the role.
  * Recruiting exceptional people that understand and are driven greatly by Vercelâ€™s mission.
  * Recognizing trends, issue patterns, and proactively taking action to prevent further difficulty for customers.

### About You:

  * Experience balancing the velocity of work with the quality of customer outcomes.
  * Experience operating as a technical leader who resolves concerns for developers.
  * Experience working with a globally distributed, technical support team.
  * Experience setting and managing KPI's and growth plans for team members.
  * Experience driving efficiencies and building teams that donâ€™t scale linearly with case volume.
  * Desire to work cross-functionally, engaging closely with Product.
  * Desire to mentor direct reports and help them succeed in their growth.
  * Desire to empower your team, unblocking and helping them to prioritize.
  * Confident dealing with a fast-paced platform with regular changes.
  * Confident in being assertive to ensure the right outcomes are achieved for customers.
  * Confident taking ownership of important decisions in the absence of leadership.
  * Confident making decisions that make long-term sense.
  * Ability to identify upstream concerns and represent the customer impact.
  * Ability to work autonomously with a reliance on asynchronous communication.
  * Ability to calmly handle pressurized situations at all times.
  * Technical knowledge within modern application development and deployment.
