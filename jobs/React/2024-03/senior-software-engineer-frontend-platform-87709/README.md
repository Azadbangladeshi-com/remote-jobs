### Coinbase  
#### `üåé Remote - USA`  

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn‚Äôt do this without hiring the best people. We‚Äôre a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they‚Äôre trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That‚Äôs us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We‚Äôre a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

**Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:**

  * You‚Äôve got positive energy. You‚Äôre optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
  * You‚Äôre never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
  * You appreciate direct communication. You‚Äôre both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let‚Äôs face it, you can‚Äôt have one without the other. You‚Äôre cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
  * You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You‚Äôre not looking for a boring job.
  * You have a ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn‚Äôt scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
  * You want to be part of a winning team. We‚Äôre stronger together, and you‚Äôre a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone. 

We are looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our Developer Experience (DevX) team. DevX is responsible for making sure all engineers at Coinbase build high-quality products while being productive and engaged. We do this by providing infrastructure, libraries, frameworks, and tooling to make it easier and faster to build high quality applications.  
  
The DevX team is a part of the Platform Product Group. The mission of the Platform Product Group is to build a trusted, scalable and compliant platform to operate with speed, efficiency and quality. Our teams build and maintain the platforms critical to the existence of Coinbase.  

**What you'll be doing:**

  * Articulate a long term technical direction and vision for maintaining and scaling our web and mobile platforms.
  * Create trustworthy user experiences by building interfaces that are simple, easy to comprehend, performant and reliable using modern tools like React, React Native, Typescript, React Navigation, Jest and Webpack.
  * Turn our vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter by working with engineers, product managers and senior leadership.
  * Mentor and train other team members on design techniques and coding standards.
  * Add positive energy in every meeting, and make your coworkers feel included in every interaction.

**What we look for in you:**

  * You have at least 5 years of experience in software engineering and at least 4 years of experience in developing web apps and shipping user-facing features with JavaScript and modern, component-based JS frameworks like React.
  * You've developed and shipped user-facing features using component-based UI frameworks.
  * You‚Äôre familiar with current trends and best practices in front-end architecture, including performance, security and usability.
  * You‚Äôre familiar with product and design lifecycles, and collaborating closely with designers, engineers, and product managers.
  * You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.

**Nice to haves:**

  * You have good understanding of React Native tools (e.g. React Native CLI, metro, etc...)
  * You have good understanding of the native build system (e.g. xcodebuild, cocoapods, build.gradle)
  * You have created a few react native modules for both iOS and Android
  * You have familiarity with Expo (e.g. Prebuild, Config, Plugins, OTA, etc...)
