Description

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn‚Äôt do this without hiring the best people. We‚Äôre a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they‚Äôre trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That‚Äôs us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We‚Äôre a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

**Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:**

  * You‚Äôve got positive energy. You‚Äôre optimistic about the future and determined to get there. 
  * You‚Äôre never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0. 
  * You appreciate direct communication. You‚Äôre both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let‚Äôs face it, you can‚Äôt have one without the other. You‚Äôre cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
  * You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You‚Äôre not looking for a boring job.
  * You have a ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn‚Äôt scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
  * You want to be part of a winning team. We‚Äôre stronger together, and you‚Äôre a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone. 

We are looking for an Engineering Leader to join Trust & Loyalty to lead a brand new team focused on high net worth individuals (HNW). This new team will work very closely with the broader Coinbase One (CB1) team.

CB1 redefines what it means to be a member of the crypto community by providing an array of unparalleled benefits like zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, account protection, and priority support to members. Our vision is to create the Amazon Prime experience for all Coinbase users, by creating a membership that users can't afford not to get, and becomes a reason users choose Coinbase over all other competitors.

As an Engineering Manager of the HNW team, you'll play a pivotal role in creating unique experiences and value to our customers that drive the largest revenue for Coinbase (think elevated in-app delight to white-glove services such as account managers & VIP support). You‚Äôll work closely with your product partner to define a business, product, and engineering strategy to launch + scale this brand new effort.

**What you‚Äôll be doing (ie. job duties):**

  * Build and manage full-stack engineering teams, to guide the development of features, services, and infrastructure across both web and mobile.
  * Coach your direct reports to have a positive impact on the organization and support their career growth.
  * Collaborate with engineers, designers, product managers, and senior leadership to translate our vision into a tangible roadmap on a quarterly basis. Break down complex projects into smaller pieces and lead the iterative design and implementation process.
  * Be a thoughtful technical voice within the team, aiding in diligent architectural decisions and fostering a culture of high-quality code and engineering processes. Collaborate with Product and Engineering teams to ensure successful delivery and operation of multi-tenanted, distributed systems at scale.
  * Work closely with our talent organization to identify and recruit exceptional engineers who align with Coinbase's culture and contribute to our products.
  * Contribute to and take ownership of processes that drive engineering quality and meet our engineering SLAs.

**What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):**

  * At least 7 years of experience in software engineering.
  * At least 2 years of engineering management experience.
  * Possess a strong understanding of what constitutes high-quality code and effective software engineering processes, creating an environment that fosters these principles.
  * Build and manage full-stack engineering teams, to guide the development of features, services, and infrastructure across both web and mobile.
  * An execution-focused mindset, capable of navigating through ambiguity and delivering results.
  * Collaborate with engineers, designers, product managers, and senior leadership to translate our vision into a tangible roadmap on a quarterly basis. Break down complex projects into smaller pieces and lead the iterative design and implementation process.
  * Be a thoughtful technical voice within the team, aiding in diligent architectural decisions and fostering a culture of high-quality code and engineering processes. Collaborate with Product and Engineering teams to ensure successful delivery and operation of multi-tenanted, distributed systems at scale.
  * You can be hands-on when needed ‚Äì whether that‚Äôs writing/reviewing code or technical documents, participating in on-call rotations and leading incidents, or triaging/troubleshooting bugs.
  * Coach your direct reports to have a positive impact on the organization and support their career growth.
  * Contribute to and take ownership of processes that drive engineering quality and meet our engineering SLAs.

**Nice to haves:**

  * Had experience leading a product team, and experience in React, React Native, Graphql, Golang, K8, and MongoDB.

  * Experience with Derivatives trading systems.
