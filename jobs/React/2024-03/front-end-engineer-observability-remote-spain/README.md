# _Frontend Engineer - Observability Grafana Cloud_

## **What is Grafana Cloud?**

Grafana Cloud is our composable observability platform that integrates metrics, logs, and traces with Grafana. It allows our customers to leverage the best open source observability software â€“ including Prometheus, Mimir, Loki, and Tempo â€“ without the overhead of installing, maintaining and scaling their own observability stack.

The Observability Frontend team is focused on making data intake into Grafana easier by providing data source integrations with prebuilt dashboards and alerts for common use cases. We want customers to easily and reliably monitor all of their servers and applications with Grafana Cloud.

We own the Grafana Cloud integrations which provide easy to use pre-built dashboards and alerts to monitor a host of popular observability targets as well as our SaaS integrations which are completely hosted solutions. The team is also responsible for our AWS Observability solution, Kubernetes, Asserts and new emerging monitoring products.

As a company we are remote-first and global, we embrace people of different experiences and backgrounds to build diverse teams where every person brings a new perspective to the software. We are looking for Frontend Engineers that are passionate about providing seamless experiences for our customers to join our growing team! Our stack is Typescript + React (interacting with backends written in Golang). Frontend Engineers at Grafana also have the opportunity to contribute to Open Source communities.

## **Requirements**

  * You are **comfortable working in a remote-first company** ; communication is key.
  * For us, working together means being **collaborative, friendly, kind, and respectful**. We operate by consensus. You can contribute to a discussion, disagree constructively, and commit to the teamâ€™s decision. You are able to communicate design decisions clearly in written and spoken English.

  * You have a good understanding of **a software development process that takes a user-centered approach**. You easily build an understanding of the usersâ€™ context and goals which will help you build the right solution with the maximum value.
  * You know how to **transform ideas into working code** â€“ you are able to design a solution, get feedback, and write a prototype by yourself.
  * You enjoy **working on complex solutions** â€“ Grafana is a highly technological solution and has avid followers who rely on it every day and who care deeply about their workflows. You value code maintainability, readability & automation.
  * You are able to **troubleshoot modern web application issues** and work with profilers, debuggers, bundlers, and testing libraries.
