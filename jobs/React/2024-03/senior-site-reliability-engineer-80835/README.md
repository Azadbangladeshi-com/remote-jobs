## The Role

Site Reliability Engineers at Maze help our engineering organization design, build and operate resilient, scalable and healthy systems.

Running highly reliable software is a complex endeavor. Our SREs build infrastructure and collaborate across our teams to help ship an excellent and trustworthy product to Mazeâ€™s customers.

### As an SRE at Maze, you will:

  * Build and operate Mazeâ€™s cloud infrastructure

  * Empower engineers to ship at pace, safely and confidently

  * Implement tooling and practices that aid engineers in observing, debugging and understanding how Mazeâ€™s system operations in production

  * Support architecture and design, across multiple teams, to ensure operational reliability and scalability

  * Build tooling and automation that drives down manual toil

  * Improve our incident management lifecycle to identify, mitigate, and learn from past incidents

Our engineering teams prioritize shipping fast, learning from data, and designing for humans in our product and process. We like to build and use products that are polished and powerful.

### Weâ€™re looking for someone who:

  * Has experience with modern SRE practices

  * Has production experience with at least one cloud platform, ideally AWS

  * Has good working knowledge of infrastructure tooling e.g. Terraform and Docker

  * Is capable with at least one programming language e.g. Python, Golang or JavaScript

  * Is enthusiastic about teaching and sharing their knowledge, and loves to level up the team around them

  * Has hands-on experience diagnosing complex production issues

  * Is comfortable with ambiguity and owning problems end-to-end

### Our stack

  * We primarily use AWS for infrastructure, managed via Terraform. Our services run on Kubernetes and Lambda.

  * We test and deploy using CircleCI and Argo CD, and monitor our application with Datadog and Sentry

  * We write full-stack TypeScript, using Node and React

Our team believes in _running less software_. We aim to build our product with a small set of highly effective tools that help our team focus on shipping impactful work to our customers.

 _We donâ€™t expect you to have experience in every area or technology listed above: if you think you could do a great job in this role, we canâ€™t wait to hear from you!_

Maze values transparency and it enables us to approach compensation equitably across the world. We are informed by data and regularly check our salary ranges (either _United States_ or _Rest of World_ ) against other venture backed companies. Additionally, we are proud of our holistic and generous benefits offerings, included in every compensation package.  
  
Your salary is dependent upon many factors, including years of experience, expertise, etc. Donâ€™t let the typical compensation range for this role stop you from applying; during your first interview, you can expect to have an open conversation with your recruiter regarding your compensation expectations.

 _Thoughts to share about how Maze communicates compensation? Weâ€™re open to hearing your_ insights and feedback.

At Maze, we are dedicated to building an equitable, inclusive, and authentic workspace. Unique and diverse perspectives are welcomed, and continuous growth is encouraged. We believe that people are more than their resumes, so if your past experience looks different than the criteria listed, we'd still love to hear from you. We appreciate and celebrate non-traditional life routes and encourage you to apply should you connect with a job description or the Maze culture.
