Lead Full Stack Engineer - Capital One Software (Remote)

Capital One has taken a bold journey to build a technology company, while operating in a complex, highly regulated business. We have built out a large engineering organization, moved to the cloud, re-architected our applications and data platforms, and embraced machine learning at scale. Our AI/ML capabilities are now at the forefront of whatâ€™s possible in banking (e.g., Eno).

As we uncovered new challenges along the way, we built and battle tested new capabilities to meet those needs. Weâ€™ve open sourced several of the software tools we built (e.g., Cloud Custodian, Hygieia) and forged new partnerships with other digital leaders (e.g., Microsoft).

We've developed a suite of internal solutions uniquely designed to meet the challenges of a digital-first, cloud-first business at scale. Today, the Capital One Software team is exploring how these internal solutions across cloud, data, security, governance, and applications could serve the needs of other companies born or built in the cloud.

Capital One Software is a new enterprise B2B software business focused on providing cloud and data management solutions to companies operating in the cloud. This is Capital Oneâ€™s first foray into the enterprise software market and comes after years spent building our own in-house cloud and data management tools that enable us to operate at scale in the cloud.
