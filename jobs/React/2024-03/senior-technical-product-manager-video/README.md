#### `ðŸŒŽ Portugal`  

We are looking for a Technical Product Manager to shape the future of our core products: APIs and SDKs to build in-app Chat Messaging, Video Audio, and Activity Feeds.

With a global remote presence and offices in Amsterdam (NL) and Boulder, CO (US), Stream is a global technical startup represented by over 35 nationalities.

### This role is open remotely in Portugal.

###  **What will you be doing**

As a Technical Product Manager, you will work on the entire Product lifecycle alongside Engineering, Product Design, Marketing, Sales, and Support. You will be exciting the entire company with the vision, strategy, and progress of the products you own.

 **Responsibilities include but are not limited to the following:**

  * Product and Market Research. Conversations with Customers are a pillar of this process.
  * Partner with the Engineering team on continuous cycles of discovery and delivery at all stages of product development, from Research to go-to-market.
  * Work with the Marketing team on positioning and messaging the product, competitor analysis, and go-to-market initiatives.
  * Enabling and training other departments (Support, CS, Sales) on the product capabilities, value proposition, differentiators, and pricing.
  * Work with Stakeholders and the Leadership team on building a solid strategy and measurable goals.

Availability to travel is required (4 to 6 times a year).

###  **What makes this role exciting?**

  * Building complex applications is becoming more accessible. Companies such as Snowflake, Cloudflare, Auth0, Algolia, or Twilio provide a new layer in the internet infrastructure. Stream has a solid vision for this space, and this is a unique opportunity to be part of this journey.
  * By joining a Scale Up company, you will work closely with all levels of the organization, including the C-level team.
  * We are transparent in our journey as a Startup and proud to share how to scale a business. You may be the one building the next big thing one day.
  * Our team has vast experience growing Startups at all stages and you will be able to learn from that experience. Bonus point: we are super fun to work with and will always support you with anything you need.
  * We push for excellence and want you to excel as a Product Leader.

###  **Who You Are**

Building products for Developers is challenging. To understand that persona, you should have a technical background and a good understanding of Software Development Tools and Techniques.

The ideal candidate should have experience managing technical products in a SaaS environment, and be able to code an app following one of our tutorials for iOS, Android, React, Flutter, or any other framework we support.

You should excel in Product Management Techniques and Product Leadership and stay connected with the community as a respected leader.

You enjoy Scale-Ups that move fast and where leadership roles need to be as good in the high-level and strategic topics as in delivering operational and day-to-day work.

  * You have 10+ years of experience in Tech companies.
  * You have 3+ years of experience in Product Management.
  * You have prior experience as a Software Engineer
  * You are tech-savvy and have solid technical background and knowledge.
  * You are a strong advocate of Product Management techniques.

  * You enjoy working in a dynamic startup environment.
