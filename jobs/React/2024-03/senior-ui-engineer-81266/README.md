Description

The Protenus Healthcare Compliance Analytics platform is powered by a data pipeline that ingests robust and varied feeds to provide visibility into potential patterns of suspicious behavior that may otherwise go unnoticed. Our AI empowers subject matter experts to mitigate and ultimately reduce organizational risk â€” whether it's an employee improperly accessing patient records, or a clinician diverting medications â€” in an efficient, accurate, and scalable manner.
