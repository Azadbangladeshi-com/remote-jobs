**About Us**

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the worldâ€™s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazineâ€™s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the Worldâ€™s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.

We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

### About the Department

Emerging Technologies & Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures which make Cloudflare a massively successful business, we are able to leverage them to deliver entirely new tools and products to our customers.

#### **About The Team**

Cloudflare helps build the future of the Internet. The Emerging Technology and Incubation (ETI) team invents, launches, and brings to market the technologies required to reach that goal. ETI ships software that changes the Internet. The world's fastest DNS resolver, 1.1.1.1, Cloudflare WARP, Cloudflare One, Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2, and Workers AI are examples of our launches.

The team members in ETI make this possible. The group consists of engineers, product managers, developer advocates and researchers who share a common passion for helping build a better Internet. The ETI organization encourages individual team members to be ambitious and bold in how we find and solve problems. We move quickly and shape our products based on customer usage and feedback, while leveraging the massive scale and reliability of our global network.

ETI also helps drive our Innovation Weeks at Cloudflare and contributes with new products, features, and visions for helping build a better Internet. Doing that requires all of ETI to execute on releases that customers will use today, tell our story as part of Cloudflareâ€™s larger mission, and to build products that allow Cloudflareâ€™s customers to realize that 1+1 can equal 3 when using all of these features together.

We are looking for a Frontend Engineer to join our team. You will work with a team of passionate, talented engineers that are building innovative products that bring security and speed to millions of internet users each day. You will play an active part in shaping product features based on whatâ€™s technically possible. Furthermore, you will make sure our company hits our ambitious goals from an engineering standpoint.

You bring a passion for meeting business needs while building technically innovative solutions, and excel at shifting between the twoâ€”understanding how big-picture goals inform technical details, and vice-versa. You thrive in a fast-paced iterative engineering environment.

### What Makes Cloudflare Special?

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

 **Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
