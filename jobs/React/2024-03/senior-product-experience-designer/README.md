About Rewiring America

Rewiring America is the leading electrification nonprofit, focused on electrifying our homes, businesses, and communities. We develop accessible, actionable data and tools, and build coalitions and partnerships to make going electric easier for households and communities. Rewiring America helps Americans save money, tackle nationwide emissions goals, improve health, and build the next generation of the clean energy workforce. We believe in an abundant, flourishing, climate-safe future, and know that, together, we can realize one.

Position Summary

We are growing our team and seeking an entrepreneurial and multidisciplinary designer who will work with our Rewiring Communities team to design an experience from scratch to support electrification projects for homeowners in low income and historically disadvantaged communities. This is a unique and important opportunity to build products and services that ensure that the electrification transition happens equitably. This position reports to the Head of Product.

What You‚Äôll Do

You will work closely with a cross-functional team at Rewiring America that is engaging directly with communities on the ground to understand the barriers that households face and to design products and services that can overcome these barriers at scale. These solutions will need to be deeply grounded in knowledge of homeowners and communities, and will likely require multiple rounds of prototyping and iteration to get right. The end goal is to craft products and services that can facilitate bringing financial resources into these communities and support electrification that can scale to historically disadvantaged communities across the country. This will require a wide variety of work, from user research and discovery to prototyping to product strategy to perhaps some front-end development for the right candidate.

 **You will:**

  * Conduct user discovery and research, synthesize your learnings and codify them into key insights, personas, and journeys - which make you a strong champion for the user experience in all aspects of the program
  * Collaborate and consult with many cross-functional stakeholders to align on the timeline, goals, outputs of the work, as well as the broader program design that the products and services fit into
  * Develop early-stage concepts and prototypes for internal and external testing and many rounds of iteration
  * Facilitate design-thinking exercises, workshops, and sprints with your team to advance new ideas
  * Wear the product manager ‚Äúhat‚Äù for this early-stage effort by writing briefs and strategy docs, aligning on priorities, and teeing up key build vs. buy decisions for key elements of the experience
  * Stay connected to the core Rewiring America engineering, product, and design team to share insights and borrow foundations (e.g. our nascent design system) to help accelerate the work.
  * Step into whatever is needed to get the job done - this is a highly independent and entrepreneurial role!
