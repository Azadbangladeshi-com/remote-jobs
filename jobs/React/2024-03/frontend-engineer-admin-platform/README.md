## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

Stripe Admin is an internal platform which is relied upon by Stripe employees globally for every part of their job: from talking with our users on the phone to launching a new feature and everything in between. Admin is an integral part of how we move quickly in service of our users. Admin Platform is responsible for the entire stack that powers Stripe Admin. Our platform supports hundreds of Stripe engineers globally, who deploy dozens of times daily into a several-hundred-thousand-line codebase to thousands of internal users; those users spend their entire day in Admin executing mission-critical tasks for Stripe. Our job is to improve productivity for all those stakeholders while upholding a world-class security posture, and this often requires intervention at every layer of the stack.
