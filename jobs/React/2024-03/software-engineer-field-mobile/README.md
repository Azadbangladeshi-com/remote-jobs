### Kojo  
#### `ðŸ’° 270000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### **About Kojo**

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. Weâ€™re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.

Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we canâ€™t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, thereâ€™s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.
