# [Experienced React Developer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/experienced-react-developer)  
### Tanooki Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

TL;DR - Flexible freelance and full-time work on amazing products.

This is not your average company job posting.

We are Tanooki Labs, a product and development studio based in the United States that works with entrepreneurs on early stage products.

We provide product-minded developers with fun projects to work on, as well as the flexibility and freedom to continue working on their own goals (be it recording an album, crafting your next app, or raising the newest member of your family).

We choose our clients and projects carefully, and every product we build requires us to tackle new and exciting challenges. We also reject the idea that software development has to feel like a grind. We work 35 hours per week, support flexible schedules, are family friendly, and work with both local and remote developers.

### Requirements

We are looking for pragmatic developers who build with:

  * empathy for users,
  * a deep understanding of the software we build and our clients' businesses,
  * an eye toward writing well architected code.

### You should have:

  * a strong background in frontend Javascript, especially React
  * bonus points for experience with TypeScript, React Native or Ruby on Rails
  * experience developing applications from the ground up
  * experience with behavior-driven development and unit testing
  * a product-minded focus when creating applications
  * good communication skills in English and a location in North America
