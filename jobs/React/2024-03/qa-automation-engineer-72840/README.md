At Two Six Technologies, we build, deploy, and implement innovative products that solve the worldâ€™s most complex challenges today. Through unrivaled collaboration and unwavering trust, we push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible to empower our team and support our customers in building a safer global future.

Would you like to use your QA and test automation skills to be a part of building the applications that help policy makers, corporate leaders, and operators make sense of increasingly complex information spaces? Two Six Technologies provides Information Advantage to Government, Military, and Fortune 50 customers tasked with mission critical decision making.

Our products collect and synthesize huge quantities of publicly available data in multiple languages, then serve that data to be easily queried by our expert analysts and used in machine learning analytics. In addition, we have product capabilities that allow our customers to engage with populations around the world through advertising, surveys, and other methods. As a QA automation engineer you will work closely with our product engineering teams to build out our testing framework for the full product suite.

As a top candidate you have experience building automation test suites from ground up, including API, UI, and unit test automation using a variety of frameworks. We are also looking for someone who is knowledgeable of, and passionate about, QA processes and methodology, with the ability to collaborate with product and engineering to understand our use cases and then create and execute the appropriate testing.

You have experience working with AWS, Linux, and ideally with technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. You also have been a member of remote engineering teams working in Agile software development environments. Ideally you have experience with Python or similar programming and scripting languages.

Having previously automated the testing of web scraping applications is not required, but is definitely a huge plus, and either way you should enjoy working out novel solutions to the technical challenges of testing that type of application. Previous experience testing applications that process data in multiple languages is another plus.

Most importantly you share our passion for applying technology to solve hard problems and deliver high quality solutions.
