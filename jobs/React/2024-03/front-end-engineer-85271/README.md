Description

Everything happens somewhere - which is why spatial analytics is fundamental to companies trying to understand the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of their business. CARTO is the leading cloud-native location intelligence platform, trusted by data scientists, data analysts and developers from companies such as Vodafone, IKEA, BT, Coca-Cola, to provide geospatial insights for use cases such as site selection, geomarketing, route optimization, network planning and much more.

  

With an exceptionally diverse team of more than 170 people spread across the US and Europe, CARTO (backed by Accel Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Earlybird Ventures, and Kibo Ventures, among others) is changing the way companies analyze location data - making it simple to do this straight out of modern, cloud data warehouses. Redefining its category, the company has grown rapidly in recent years providing a compelling alternative to legacy GIS software.

  

CARTO with its new CARTO 3 platform has built the most advanced location intelligence platform which connects directly to the most used Data Warehouses in the industry such as Google‚Äôs BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake and Databricks; thus, allowing our partners and customers to do location intelligence and geospatial analysis directly where their data lives opening limitless possibilities for their businesses.

  * At ease with technology, able to quickly pick up new tech stacks and troubleshoot.
  * Fluent written & spoken English
  * Autonomy, curiosity & good energy.
  * A true will to teach & learn from your coworkers (code reviews, tech discussions‚Ä¶)

  * Experience with geospatial visualization or mapping libraries like Deck.gl, Google Maps, Mapbox GL or MapLibre. 
  * Experience with WebGL2/WebGPU.
