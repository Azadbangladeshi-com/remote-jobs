### **Who You Are**

Youâ€™re a perfectionist. Yes, the big picture matters, and thinking strategically about the whole product gets you fired up. But the intricacies? Thatâ€™s where the magic lives. Youâ€™re a diligent problem solver, and an even more adept problem _finder_. Your deep understanding of your craft means you know how each individual piece worksâ€” and more importantly, how they work most efficiently together.

Youâ€™re a seasoned full stack engineer with a passion for building scalable web applications. Your expert understanding of the JavaScript and React ecosystems on top of general web development best practices mean that sometimes youâ€™re both the artist and the critic; but you wouldnâ€™t have it any other way.

Youâ€™re a dedicated player-coach used to working in a senior roleâ€” you love to spearhead projects and mentor team members as much as you love to write code. You know that no success comes on the back of a single person; youâ€™re a collaborative leader with experience in building the highest possible quality software solutions as a team.

Most importantly, youâ€™re excited to bring your skills to a growing company in a fast-moving market. Youâ€™re ready to shake up an industry; you just need the right opportunity to make waves.
