### Clerk  
#### `ðŸ’° ~0k` `ðŸŒŽ Remote,San Francisco, CA,US`  

## About the role

Clerk is hiring frontend and backend engineers, remote or in-office in San Francisco

We build developers tools for authentication. We're known for our React components like `<SignIn/>` and `<UserProfile/>` that "just work" when they're added to the page.

Our components are powered by a new type of API: a frontend-facing API that relies on session tokens for authorization, instead of a backend-facing API that relies on a secret key.

We've found this pattern unlocks a new level of efficiency. Developers can implement Clerk faster than traditional APIs because it comes built-in with UX and UI. To learn more about the approach, see our talk on A Component is Worth a Thousand APIs.

## Who we're looking for

We're especially excited to work with engineers who are thoughtful about speed and craft. Clerk is defining the gold standard for components-as-a-service, and we are constantly searching for new ways to evolve and improve our approach.

## Business status

Business growth has been healthy and we have over 1,500 paying customers. We're a Series B company funded by a16z, CRV, Stripe, and more.
