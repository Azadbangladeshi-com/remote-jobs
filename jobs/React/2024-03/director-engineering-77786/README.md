Our vision is to build the next-generation platform for fast and easy creation of audio and video content. In June 2022, we launched Storyboard, a completely redesigned experience around video creation and what we have always envisioned to be our v1. We are used by some of the world's top podcasters and influencers as well as businesses such as BBC, ESPN, Hubspot, Shopify and Washington Post for communicating via video. We've raised $100M from some of the world's best investors like OpenAI, Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures and Spark Capital.

To justify our ambitious vision and serve our rapidly growing customer base, weâ€™re planning to accelerate growth of the engineering team and are looking for a senior engineering leader who can lead and scale with the rapid growth of the company. Youâ€™ll oversee multiple teams, and this role reports directly into the VP of Engineering.
