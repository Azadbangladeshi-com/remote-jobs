**Headquarters:** United States  
**URL:** https://www.morphmarket.com/

MorphMarket is the world's biggest marketplace for exotic animals (snakes, lizards, etc.) with over a million users. We're growing fast and branching into aquatics amongst other areas.  
  
**Culture:**  
  
We run a calm, zero politics, zero finger-pointing operation where the focus is on high-quality technical work, on improving as engineers, and on teamwork (in the sense of solving hard problems by communicating and sharing knowledge).  
  
**Location**:  
  
We're based in the US but much of our team is based in the EU so working times where you overlap for approx half the day in the US is fine.  
  
**Technologies**:  
  
You'll need BOTH React Native and Django/Python skills to fill this role. If you don't have significant experience in either of these areas, please do not apply. We specifically need someone who can solve problems that require deep knowledge of both technologies and previous hires missing either of these two weren't able to crack our technical problems.  
  
Knowledge of WebViews is a huge plus.

\- Django Rest Framework  
\- Swift  
\- Expo  
\- App release processes and navigating app store challenges  
\- Shell scripting  
\- Kotlin  
\- Heroku  
\- SQL speed optimization  
\- React.js  
\- HTTP caching  
\- Queue systems  
\- AWS  
\- Multi-threaded code
