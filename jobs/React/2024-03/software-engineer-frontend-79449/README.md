Description

  

Role

Regrello is seeking a skilled **Frontend Software Engineer** who is as passionate about design systems, data fetching, and discriminated unions as they are about CRDTs and the psychology of human cognition. In this role, you will work closely with our senior engineers, junior engineers, and product team to design, develop, maintain, and scale Regrello's frontend React/TypeScript/GraphQL application code. You will drive projects, lead and participate in design discussions, communicate directly with customers, effect real change in an industry that is enthusiastically rooting for us, and help empower the rest of our team to do their best work as well.

  

Company

 **Regrello** is a 40-person startup reimagining automation in supply chains, in which companies still communicate about $13T of annual shipments almost entirely via email. This is a $220-billion, Amazon-sized market opportunity that‚Äôs been largely overlooked for over 20 years. Our team has experience building billion-dollar companies and includes veterans from Oracle, Palantir, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Our customers include some of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world. We're funded by Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Dell, Bloomberg, and Ram Sriram (first investor in Google). With a 2-3 year runway, we offer startup agility and longer-term stability.

  

Product

We are building a global operating network that finally enables supply-chain companies to collaborate within one platform. Our **workflow engine** empowers non-technical industry experts to model their complex manufacturing and operational processes. Our **forms engine** enables unprecedented data exchange between companies. And our upcoming **AI engine** summarizes the complex goings-on across thousands of workflows, identifying inefficiencies and driving optimization as companies react to a constantly-shifting global landscape. Quote one user: ‚ÄùI‚Äôve been waiting for this for 20 years.‚Äù

  

Culture and Compensation

We are a customer-obsessed, product-driven company that is building a flexible, hybrid/remote culture to enable the brightest minds in the industry. We are particularly interested in candidates based in our hubs of Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, but we will consider candidates who live anywhere in the US, Canada, or Mexico. We have industry-leading compensation packages, including equity and health benefits. We are willing to sponsor US work authorization if needed.

### Requirements

  * B.S. in Computer Science or related field, with 3.5+ GPA (M.S. is a plus)
  * 2-5 years of industry experience as a software engineer
  * Deep experience with React or another view framework, TypeScript, component design, visual design, data flow, events, CSS, APIs, and web-performance issues (experience with GraphQL is a plus)
  * A builder's spirit (you've built something on the side just for the fun of it)
  * Ability to work independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced startup environment
  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills
  * Enthusiasm for learning and growing as a software engineer‚Äîand for helping your peers do the same

### Responsibilities

  * Collaborate with cross-functional teams including Design, Product Management, and industry experts to build high-quality product features.
  * Take on new challenges and responsibilities as needed, and be an enthusiastic team player in a dynamic startup environment.
  * Help shape the company by participating in hiring decisions and contributing to our culture of continuous learning and growth.
