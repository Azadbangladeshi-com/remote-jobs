### Torc Robotics  
#### `ðŸ’° 353800.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### About the Company

At Torc, we have always believed that autonomous vehicle technology will transform how we travel, move freight, and do business.

A leader in autonomous driving since 2007, Torc has spent over a decade commercializing our solutions with experienced partners. Now a part of the Daimler family, we are focused solely on developing software for automated trucks to transform how the world moves freight.

Join us and catapult your career with the company that helped pioneer autonomous technology, and the first AV software company with the vision to partner directly with a truck manufacturer.

### Meet the team

Accurate and highly available information about the vehicle ego-motion and localization is central to ensure an adequate functioning of the virtual driver software of an autonomous truck. Core functionalities such as environment perception and prediction, as well as motion planning and control, strongly rely on this information to guarantee that the vehicle executes a collision-free driving plan. Accordingly, our ego-motion and localization modules are responsible for supplying reliable ego-motion and localization state estimates even in the presence of external disturbances, sensor imperfections, and system degradation.

As part of the ego-motion estimation and localization team, you will be able to design, develop, and release sensor fusion algorithms for the real-time estimation of the vehicle pose, velocity and acceleration. You will also gain a deep understanding of not only self-driving technology, but also its real-world challenges and how to convert such technology into real products.

### What you will do:

  * Execute full software development lifecycle activities using modern C++, including developing and releasing robust and reliable solutions to ego-motion estimation and localization problems 
  * Analyze and improve the current ego-motion estimation and localization algorithms, ensuring our self-driving vehicles have the best ego-motion and localization accuracy to drive safely and smoothly on the road 
  * Define software requirements, design software architecture, and develop robust verification strategies to guarantee the effective development and quality assurance of our software solutions 
  * Integration of software standards and safety requirements into the ego-motion estimation and localization software 
  * Collaborate with a creative team of engineers and researchers to solve multi-disciplinary problems 
  * Improve how our vehicles act and react in complex and nuanced situations 

### What you will need to succeed:

  * Bachelor's degree in computer science, computer engineering, robotics, aerospace engineering or a related field 
  * 3+ years hands-on experience in C++ programming, as well as solid Python programming skills 
  * 4+ years industry experience in robotics, software engineering or relevant PhD degree 
  * Experience with inertial navigation, GNSS, statistical estimation or sensor fusion 
  * Solid background in SLAM, visual odometry or computer vision 
  * Experience with nonlinear optimization frameworks such as GTSAM, CERES, g2o 
  * Experience with software development for resource-constrained embedded systems 
  * Expertise with Linux software development environment, Git, Jenkins and Docker 
  * Strong written and verbal communication skills 

### Bonus Points!

  * Master's or PhD degree in a relevant field 
  * Familiarity with deep learning frameworks for feature extraction and analysis 
  * Knowledge of safety engineering, functional safety and requirements engineering according to ISO26262 
  * Knowledge of vehicle kinematics, dynamics, mechatronics, and E/E-Systems 

### Perks of Being a Full-time Torcâ€™r
