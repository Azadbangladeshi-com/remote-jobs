Description

## **Company Overview**

Marketers have a problem. Today companies spend over $1T to bring customers to the door, but $19 of every $20 they spend does not convert to revenue. Companies have no choice other than to dedicate large engineering and data science teams to manually build more relevant, higher-converting experiences for different customer segments.

Mutiny is a no-code AI conversion platform that helps marketers convert their top-of-funnel demand into revenue, without engineers. Mutiny gives marketers everything they need to drive revenue and prove it‚Äîfrom data and analytics to AI-powered recommendations and content writing.

The world‚Äôs fastest-growing companies, including Notion, Snowflake, Qualtrics, and Carta use Mutiny to convert their visitors into customers. We are backed by Sequoia Capital, Insight Partners, Uncork Capital, Cowboy Ventures, and Tiger Global, along with current and former CMOs from world-class companies like Atlassian, Carta, Cond√© Nast, Figma, Salesforce, Snowflake, Square, Visa, and Uber.
