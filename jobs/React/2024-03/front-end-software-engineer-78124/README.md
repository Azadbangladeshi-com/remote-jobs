  * Produce highly performant and flexible user interfaces.
  * Collaborate with designers and other UI engineers across the company to learn from others and to ensure you stay up to date on the companyâ€™s UI best practices.
  * Learn and improve your skills to continuously push us to deliver higher quality data products and improve how we view data visualization as a company.

  

This role requires

  * 2+ years of experience working with JavaScript, and experience working with front-end frameworks such as React
  * Familiarity with modern development and build tools such as git, npm, babel, and webpack; experience with front-end JS testing tools and a comprehensive understanding of UI testing techniques
  * Experience integrating the UI with data from service endpoints using modern technologies such as GraphQL

Bonus points if you have

  * Thrive in a fast-paced environment focused on delivering production code at a regular cadence using Agile techniques, tools, and methodologies.
