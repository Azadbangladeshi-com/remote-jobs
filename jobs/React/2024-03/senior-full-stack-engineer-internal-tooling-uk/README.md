Description

**Our Mission**

Reduce inequity by helping immigrants move money home, and become the leading cross-border fintech for emerging markets.

  

 **The Team**

-> Founded by Harvard grads / 3rd-time founders --- also founded Segovia (successful exit) and GiveDirectly (>300M revenue, fastest-growing NGO).

-> Top performers from top and varied organizations (e.g., Bain, Bolt, Google, McKinsey, SafeBoda, Uber, Zipline) --- we like moving fast, and we hire people that do as well.

-> Driven by mission, guided by values (see below) â€“ in deed, not just word.

-> Team as global as the mission, >30 languages from 25 countries (i.e., if youâ€™re interested in learning to make Chicken Moambe, weâ€™re the place).

  

 **About Us**

Taptap Send is backed by top VCs (Spark, Canaan, Reid Hoffman, Breyer Capital, etc.), rapidly growing and a great place for those looking for both impact and a fast-paced tech startup environment. Read more about the journey in Reid Hoffmanâ€™s words or TechCrunch article

  

Launched in 2019, Taptap is tapping into a transformative shift in global finance: from banks to phones. While this has affected wealthier countries as well, it has been nothing short of a revolution for the emerging markets where the overwhelming majority of population had been unable to access digital finance previously. Taptap Send allows immigrants to send money home instantly and with no fee*, saving money in the process. With a formal market size of >700B alone, weâ€™ve got a lot more saving to do for our users. Our mission is to reduce inequity by helping immigrants move money home, and become the leading cross-border fintech for emerging markets. And thatâ€™s just the beginning...
