### About Metomic

Over the last ten years, SaaS has changed the way we work â€” for the better. Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but itâ€™s also introducing a new surface area of risk theyâ€™ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team down.

At Metomic, we help companies protect sensitive data in SaaS applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.

Our technology connects to SaaS applications, detects the most critical sensitive data risks, and put automated policies in place to ensure these risks donâ€™t happen again in the future.This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.

After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the worldâ€™s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Octopus Energy and Crypto.com. In 2023 we raised a $20m Series A round led by Evolution Equity and backed by other investors such Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc), and Resonance.vc.  

###  
Engineering Team

As we continue to change the way companies deal with their sensitive data, our Engineering Team is growing and weâ€™re looking to welcome Software Engineers, either back-end or full-stack, to our team to be part of this journey.

Some of the areas you may be working on: Our sensitive data and classification engine, building systems to allow us to process billions of messages a day, data ingest pipelines, sensitive data remediation system, risk identification and ranking engines and alerting systems.

Our back-end services are written in Typescript and make extensive use of Kafka, GraphQL and Postgres. Our front-end is written in React/TypeScript. Our house style is grounded in functional programming principles. We use AWS ECS Fargate via github actions and Terraform to deploy to production multiple times a day.

### Requirements

  *  _Product-minded and pragmatic engineers_ \- Front of mind for you is thinking through what the best solution is for the problem the customer is facing. Youâ€™ll be given a lot of autonomy to explore solutions from what we build, how itâ€™s designed and what technologies we use.
  *  _Problem-solvers_ \- Weâ€™re facing a lot of previously uncharted territory and with that a set of new and unseen challenges. Youâ€™re not one to shy away from tackling these sorts of problems. Youâ€™ll think through not just how to solve a problem, but what caused the problem in the first place and how we can make improvements to prevent similar problems in the future.
  *  _One eye on now, one eye on whatâ€™s next_ \- Our engineers have a passion for bringing to life distributed systems and scalable and robust architectures. Youâ€™ll have a huge role in coming up with how the system will evolve from an architecture and engineering standpoint.
  *  _Culture contributors_ \- Weâ€™re a small, close-knit team and recognise the importance of our culture as we continue to grow. Youâ€™ll be pivotal in helping shape the early stages and building a team platform that we can grow from.  
  
We encourage applications from all backgrounds, communities and industries and we are happy to discuss any reasonable adjustments that you require.
