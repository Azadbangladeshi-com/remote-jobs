Description

Company

 **Regrello** is a 40-person startup reimagining automation in supply chains, in which companies still communicate about $13T of annual shipments almost entirely via email. This is a $220-billion, Amazon-sized market opportunity that‚Äôs been largely overlooked for over 20 years. Our team has experience building billion-dollar companies and includes veterans from Oracle, Palantir, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Our customers include some of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, all of which are hungry for us to succeed. We're funded by Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Dell, Bloomberg, and Ram Sriram (first investor in Google).

  

Product

We are building a global operating network that finally enables supply-chain companies to collaborate within one platform. Our **workflow engine** empowers non-technical industry experts to model their complex manufacturing and operational processes. Our **forms engine** enables unprecedented data exchange between companies. And our upcoming **AI engine** can generate entire new processes and summarize the complex goings-on across thousands of workflows, identifying inefficiencies and driving optimization as companies react to a constantly-shifting global landscape.
