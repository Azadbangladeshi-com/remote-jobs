Join our cross-functional Web team as a front-end software engineer and help us build a performant, high-converting, and accessible marketing site using the latest web technologies.

###  **Who are we?**

Sanity.io is a modern, flexible content platform that replaces rigid legacy content management systems so companies like **PUMA, Spotify, Figma, Riot Games** , and **Skims** can create amazing digital experiences for their customers.

One of our big differentiators is treating content as data so that it can be stored in a single source of truth but seamlessly adapted and personalized for any channel without extra effort. Forward-thinking companies choose Sanity because they can create tailored content authoring experiences, customized workflows, and content models that reflect their business.

Backed by Netlify, Vercel, the founders of Twitter and Medium, Herokuâ€™s ex-CEO, and leading VCs like ICONIQ Growth, Threshold Ventures, and Lead Edge Capital, Sanity is at the epicenter of the modern digital product development stack.

You can only build a great company with a great culture. Read about our values and join us in building a diverse and inclusive team.

###  **About the Role**

As a front-end software engineer, youâ€™ll be part of a highly skilled and supporting team of developers, designers, and content creators to create a best-in-class marketing site using the latest web technologies (TypeScript, Next.js, Vercel, Sanity).

Youâ€™ll get the opportunity to contribute to development projects from ideation to production, build out our internal design system and component library, and work alongside the rest of the Web team on user research, experimentation, and rapid iterations.

  * Ensure that our site is accessible by leveraging browser accessibility features.
  * Make data-driven decisions based on user research, experimentation, and rapid iteration.
  * Collaborate with other teams at Sanity, such as Growth, Product Marketing, Content Marketing, and Demand Generation.

###  **This may be you**

  * Strong web development generalist who can adapt to new technologies and scenarios and find pragmatic solutions for the problems at hand.
