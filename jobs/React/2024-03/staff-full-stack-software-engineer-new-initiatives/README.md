## Company Description

Dropbox is a special place where we are all seeking to fulfill our mission to design a more enlightened way of working. Weâ€™re looking for innovative talent to join us on our journey. The words shared by our founders at the start of Dropbox still ring true today. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if our working environmentâ€”and the tools we useâ€”were designed with peopleâ€™s actual needs in mind? Imagine if every minute at work were well spentâ€”if we could focus and spend our time on the things that matter. This is possible, and Dropbox is connecting the dots. The nearly 3,000 Dropboxers around the world have helped make Dropbox a living workspace - the place where people come together and their ideas come to life. Our 700+ million global users have been some of our best salespeople, and they have helped us acquire customers with incredible efficiency. As a result, we reached a billion dollar revenue run rate faster than any software-as-a-service company in history. Dropbox is making the dream of a
fulfilling and seamless work life a reality. We hope youâ€™ll join us on the journey.

## Team Description

AMP is an entrepreneurial arm of Dropbox, exploring 0â†’1 opportunities and building new products that will make a difference in the lives of Dropbox customers and employees. We are looking for a resourceful engineer who will be the founding member in one of our explorations to help us explore these opportunities via rapid prototyping, on our way to find a product-market fit. Ideally, you are at your best when you are in fast-paced and startup-like teams, shipping customer-facing products and having a deep curiosity which leads you to build side projects of your own. If you are an engineer who enjoys taking ownership of your projects and making things happen in the face of ambiguity, we want to hear from you!

  * Develop customer-centric prototypes for new product explorations
  * Manage and lead a small team of engineers and grow the team as needed
  * Proactively communicate your learnings and progress to your team and the leadership
  * Establish and maintain relationships with other engineering teams and collaborate with other functions within Dropbox

## Requirements

  * You have 10+ years of engineering experience
  * Experience leading projects, determining requirements, and quickly iterating based on user feedback
  * Experience working in a start-up or start-up-like environment
  * Experience developing full-stack web applications (React, Python, or similar)
  * Experience building customer-facing products, especially feed-based products (like Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok)
  * Experience working with cloud services (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud) and leveraging these services to speed up development when possible
  * Experience designing products from scratch with product and design teams
  * Willingness to experiment with and quickly pick up new technologies

Many teams at Dropbox run Services with on-call rotations, which entails being available for calls during both core and non-core business hours. If a team has an on-call rotation, all engineers on the team are expected to participate in the rotation as part of their employment. Applicants are encouraged to ask for more details of the rotations to which the applicant is applying.
