### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

 **Where and how you can work**

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

 **What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * You will lead and coach a team of 3 engineers focused on building the Canva public REST API Capabilities.
  * You will be accountable for team delivery and ongoing delivery improvements.
  * You will partner with Product to shape our roadmap, balancing product outcomes with pragmatic technical excellence.
  * You will contribute to the technical strategy by representing one of the two Canva Integrations at Scale teams in the larger Ecosystem group.
  * You will seek exciting opportunities to improve the general experience of building integrations using our developer platform.
  * You will be a hands-on leader contributing directly to progressing goals with code.

 **You're probably a match if**

  * You are a technical and people leader - having led high-performing teams where everyone can share their best ideas and be their best selves.
  * Most of our code is in Java, so ideally you will be comfortable using Java (or another similar object-oriented programming language)
  * We run on AWS so you would have a working knowledge of the platform
  * You understand the product life cycle, features, technical debt, QA, and supporting quality at speed. 
  * You will know when you need to push back, shielding the team from disruptions. You will provide a safe environment that helps to bring clarity.
  * You will be more than happy to work in our environment - our core stack is Microservices Java backend, with a React/Typescript frontend.
  * You will have found the love and passion for coaching people and developing a culture that enables teams to be their best.
  * You will have the ability to work with a diverse range of individuals from different backgrounds and with different professional and personal needs.
  * Your excellent written and verbal communication skills will enable you to manage stakeholders and communicate effectively across other groups.
  * You will be leading by example - promoting Canvaâ€™s values, no-blame mentality, and inclusive culture.

  
**About the Group**

The Ecosystem group contributes to Canvaâ€™s growth towards 1 billion users by creating an abundant app ecosystem that tailors to the diverse needs of our users across all demographics. As Canva continues to play a larger role in organisations with larger teams it is essential that we continue building an ecosystem that supports integrations with 3rd party tools/apps/services. We are introducing a public REST API for Canva to serve third-party developers and support integrations with enterprises and SaaS software!  
  
The Ecosystem strategy involves three priorities:

  * Build and scale the Canva API to enable deep integrations into (and outside of) Canvaâ€™s editor product
  * Create a truly delightful experience for our developers and their customers.
  * Building high-quality integrations with strategic partners to benefit Canvaâ€™s users.

 **About the Role**

The Integration Capabilities team plays a vital role in the Ecosystem strategy by working closely with internal and external teams to build a suite of API capabilities and integrations using backend REST APIs (aka Connect API) that meet Canvaâ€™s engineering best practices.  
The team is also responsible for maintaining an existing suite of APIs that are widely used by Enterprise customers.  
  
Some of the engineering challenges the team will face include:

  * Designing REST APIs for internal and external usage by enterprise partners that provide a consistent experience
  * Working with the Partner Apps and Integrations team to support the creation of 1P and 2P applications and integrations that use the Connect API
  * Working with Enterprise partners to refine existing and developer new Connect API capabilities

  
The team lead is responsible for driving the product direction, providing technical guidance to the team, growing engineers, and collaborating with cross-functional leaders on roadmap goals and milestones. You will also be working closely with external partners to ensure consistency across Canvas public API surface areas.

 **What's in it for you?**

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
