HOW YOU’LL MAKE A HUGE IMPACT HERE – AND ON YOUR CAREER  
As a Senior Software Developer on the Cash App Squad, you will work with a talented group of engineers to ensure that we deliver quality code on time while helping us to streamline processes and optimize our workflow. This is a unique opportunity for focused engineers with a dedication to the craft and an eagerness to improve teams. You will work to deliver new features, fix bugs, reduce tech debt, help level-up less experienced developers via code reviews and mentoring, and help shape and drive team culture.  
  

### What You'll Do

  * Get stuff done: Implement new features, improve user experiences, and fix bugs in a mature SaaS application.
  * Grow those around you: Review PRs to educate others of best practices, pair program with people who are stuck on a problem, ensure the team is following agreed upon standards.
  * Design solutions: As needed, work closely with the Implementations Team to turn customer needs/pain points into actionable work with technical designs.
  * Help define and implement future architecture: Help create an architectural roadmap to future proof our app and make that plan come to life.
  * Focus on NFRs: Ensure we have the right level of resiliency, logging, monitoring, security, etc.
  * Support production: Help debug/diagnose/triage emergency production issues (luckily rare).

### What You'll Bring to the Team:

  * Education & Experience:
  * 5+ years of experience with RoR and Javascript. 
  * B.S. Computer Science, Mathematics, or related field is prefered but not necessary.
  * Familiarity with SaaS applications and the FinTech domain are a plus.
  * Vision: An insatiable desire to make the team awesome; a drive to identify and seize opportunities for wins both in the code and in how the team works.
  * Technical Expertise: A strong understanding of programming patterns, best practices, long term software maintenance, software architecture, and how to balance best vs. practical.
  * Collaboration: Work closely with others to achieve team goals. Understand how to give feedback appropriately. Mentor/coach via pair programming if needed.
  * Technical Oversight: Ensure that the code is appropriately optimized (avoiding n+1 queries, etc.), appropriately structured, appropriately formatted, that technical decisions made are right, that the code is well-tested, and that we aren't introducing technical debt.
  * Humility/Teamwork: Succeed as a team, fail as a team. Promote a blameless culture. See teammates as equals.

All of our Veeps live out our core values: We look for excellence: individuals that are better than we are and not only meet our values but bring value to our teams.  
Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. Think you have what it takes, but not sure you check every box? Apply to the role anyways. We’d love to talk and determine together whether you could be a great fit!  
We are committed to providing an environment that is inclusive and accessible. Versapay is an equal opportunity employer and considers all applicants for employment without discrimination.
