Description

**Hi, we are ecobee.**

ecobee introduced the worldâ€™s first smart Wi-Fi thermostat to help millions of consumers save money, conserve energy, and bring home automation into their lives. That was just the beginning. We continue our pursuit to create technology that brings peace of mind into the home and allows people to focus on the moments that matter most. We take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment, all while being part of the exciting, connected home revolution.

In 2021, ecobee became a subsidiary of Generac Power Systems. Generac introduced the first affordable backup generator and later created the category of automatic home standby generator. The company is committed to sustainable, cleaner energy products poised to revolutionize the 21st century electrical grid. Together, we take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment.

**Why we love to do what we do:**

Weâ€™re helping build the world of tomorrow with solutions that improve everyday life while making a positive impact on the planet. Our products and services work in harmony to provide comfort, efficiency, and peace of mind for millions of homes and businesses. While weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve done so far, thereâ€™s still a lot we can doâ€”and you can be part of it.

**Join our extraordinary team.**

We're a rapidly growing global tech company headquartered in Canada, in the heart of downtown Toronto, with a satellite office in Leeds, UK (and remote ecopeeps in the US). We get to work with some of North America and UK's leading professionals. Our colleagues are proud to bring their authentic selves to work, confident that what we do is grounded in a greater purpose. Weâ€™re always looking for curious, talented, and passionate people to join our team.

**Who Youâ€™ll Be Joining:**

As a Web Developer on the dotcom team, you'll create an experience that serves as the company's face to its customers. You'll be responsible for an experience that guides and informs customers on their eCommerce journey as well as providing visibility and knowledge on ecobee's products and initiatives.

**How Youâ€™ll Make an Impact:**

As a Web Developer, you will be continually involved in shaping the direction of what web technologies we are using and how we implement those technologies. As someone who is familiar with the ever-changing universe that is the vast and infinite Web, you'll be part of a team that has the freedom to choose their own tools for development. This freedom is encouraged through a relaxed view on coding that allows for individual expression - where everyone has a voice and every opinion is valued. Our team believes in a thoughtful and well-planned development cycle. We iterate, refactor, rewrite - in other words, no throwing code over the fence. You'll have ownership of the experiences you create, continually improving them and providing production support.

  * You have your web fundamentals down pat (HTML, CSS and JavaScript)
  * You have a high level of confidence in your JavaScript, and you have a thirst to learn and know more
  * You're more than comfortable in Typescript, and in common web frameworks, such as but not limited to React
  * You practice and recognize the advantages of component-based design and development
  * You're an agilest who believes in shipping frequently and iterating as we learn and have strong time management and communication skills.
  * You understand that the web is for everyone, and champion accessibility and inclusive design
  * Collaboration and iteration are part of who you are, and you are willing to engage your peers in both giving and accepting constructive feedback

**Bonus points if you are familiar with**

  * GatsbyJS or other React-based framework 
  * Contentful or other headless CMS
  * Shopify App development

_Just so you know: The hired candidate will be required to complete a background check._

**What happens after you apply:**

**Application review.** It will happen. By an actual person in Talent Acquisition. We get upwards of 100+ applications for some roles, it can take a few days, but every applicant can expect a note regarding their application status.

**Interview Process:**

  * Round 1: A 45-minute phone call with a member of Talent Acquisition
  * Round 2: A 1-hour virtual interview with a pair of our engineering managers, including the engineering manager of the Dotcom team
  * Round 3: A practical take-home challenge followed by 1.5-hour virtual interview in which you'll present your solution to senior members of our Dotcom team
