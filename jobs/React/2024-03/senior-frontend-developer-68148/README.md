# [Senior Frontend Developer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-frontend-developer-68148)  
### Spielworks  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Germany`  

Spielworks brings the benefits of blockchain to mass-market gaming: true ownership of digital assets, secure handling of tokens and comfortable interaction with exceptional Web3 and mainstream games.

We're currently searching for a Senior Frontend Developer to join our team. If you're passionate about accessibility, accountability, innovation, and trust, you might be the person we're looking for.

Tasks

  * Develop and maintain high-quality the frontend for our Web3 games Dungeon Master and Dungeon Worlds; help out in the development of our Chrome Extension and our Wombat Desktop app (in Electron)
  * Take responsibility on the application architecture and mentor colleagues on it
  * Collaborate with the design team to implement intuitive and user-friendly interfaces
  * Optimize application performance and ensure cross-browser compatibility
  * Write understandable, efficient, and scalable (in terms of features) code that follows best practices
  * Troubleshoot and debug issues reported by users and provide timely resolutions
  * Communicating with the team about next steps in our projects and following these

Requirements

The type of person we are looking for is a self starter, someone who is happy to take responsibility and likes to work with high levels of autonomy. Being active and accountable. Advancing our technology. Ability to communicate effectively with everyone in the company.

The key is communication with the other team members, both through comm-channels like Slack and meetings but also through documentation of the code itself and its structure. You see the layers in an application and strife to separate between them. Youâ€™re not afraid of changing a structure that does not fit new requirements anymore.

  * Proven experience in frontend development
  * Proficiency in TypeScript and SASS
  * Experience with React and Redux
  * Strong understanding of responsive design principles
  * Ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and communicate effectively
  * Ideally, some experience navigating grown applications

Benefits

  * Fully remote or hybrid in our Berlin office (fully your choice!)
  * 30 days holiday plus national holidays
  * Wombat tokens
  * Employee discounts
