Description

**COMPANY**

At 0x, our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. Weâ€™re a mission-driven and diverse team composed of world-class talent from Coinbase, Google, Meta, Bitso, Citi, Spotify and other top companies. We are a remote-first and fully distributed company, with team members located across all of the continents besides Antarctica. As early pioneers in the space, weâ€™ve made significant technical contributions to various Ethereum standards over the years; _fun fact - our team helped establish the NFT token standard (ERC721)._

In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.

Founded in 2017, 0x created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: the open-source, global backbone for decentralized exchange. And weâ€™ve since developed two other keystone products: Matcha and the 0x developer platform.

Matcha is a DEX aggregator, built by 0x. With over 5 million tokens indexed across 9 blockchains, the decentralized exchange provides aggregated liquidity from +100 sources and the most efficient trade execution through smart routing. Matcha offers swaps, limit orders and cross chain trades, having enabled over $62B volume and 3.5M+ trades as the first consumer-facing product by the 0x team.

0x platform is developers' one-stop shop to build financial products on crypto rails. 0x empowers hundreds of teams and developers with essential web3 tools to enable faster trading, better prices and superior UX. Our suite of APIs has processed over 60M+ million transactions and $133B+ in volume from more than 6 million users trading on apps like Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood Wallet, Metamask, Zerion, Zapper, and more.
