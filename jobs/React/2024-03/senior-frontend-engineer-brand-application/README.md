Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

**Where and how you can work**

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

**What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

Brand functionality is of growing importance to Canva.

The role will be focussed on delivering new features.

 **What is exciting about this role?**

Brand is a core part of Canva's value proposition for all users. We're still scratching the surface of what this feature set can be, and you will play a significant part in defining the future of one of the most important parts of Canva.
