# [Engineering Manager - Canva UK](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/engineering-manager-canva-uk-59915)  
### Canva  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but we have a swanky new office in London that has all the bells and whistles. Even though you'll find us in Shoreditch, you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Lead the team to develop and deliver exciting new charts and data visualizations to Canva 
  * Contribute to the evolving stack as part of a highly functional and passionate team
  * Work closely with other product teams in Australia to collaboratively innovate and deliver cutting-edge functionality.
  * Coach, lead, and mentor your team to help them achieve their goals.
  * Perform structured performance reviews with your team members, conduct regular 1:1s, participate in the hiring process of new engineers, and plan goals & milestones for your team.
  * Foster a positive and productive work environment by promoting collaboration, open communication, and continuous learning and development opportunities for your team.

### You're probably a match if

  * You are not fully hands-off and in tune with software engineering fundamentals and first principles, comfortable contributing to design documents, performing thorough code reviews, and, at times, coding when needed.
  * Youâ€™ve got experience and knowledge of cross-browser and cross-device development.
  * You possess strong knowledge of JavaScript, modern frameworks (React) and web technologies (HTML/CSS)
  * You have several years of experience in people management, leading and mentoring other software engineers. Providing mentorship to others is close to your heart, and you thrive by empowering others.
  * You have strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to articulate problems and solutions clearly.
  * You have a strong ability to influence and work cross-functionally across several internal teams, to work with a diverse range of individuals from different backgrounds, with different expertise, and with different professional and personal needs.
  * You ideally have any previous experience with data visualisation technologies and frameworks (D3, Three.js, etc.)

### About the team

The Data Visualisation group, based in Canvaâ€™s new UK headquarters in Shoreditch, London, delivers new data visualisations and charts to Canva users, such as the recently launched Racing Bar Chart. The group works closely with other product teams in Canva to ensure that our Charts features work seamlessly with other products. Visualising data will be a critical tool in this new era of visual communication and the group is at the heart of delivering this for Canva.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
