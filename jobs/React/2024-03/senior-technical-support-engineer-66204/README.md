### About us

In the last few years, remote and hybrid work has had an explosion in popularity, giving workers an unprecedented level of access to opportunity and an increase in quality of life. However, our existing tools were not set up to do remote work _well_. Work can be isolating, transactional, and void of the camaraderie that makes everyone feel like theyâ€™re in it together.

To solve this, Gather builds virtual offices that bring the best of in-person work to remote. Weâ€™ve already seen success with our approach, with over 10,000 remote-first companies using our spaces every day.

And yet itâ€™s still the early days for our broader vision of the Metaverse. Weâ€™re excited about how the Metaverse can break down physical constraints that exist today, not just in where you can work, but which friends/family you can see, or what educational opportunities you can have access to.
