### Vital  
#### `ðŸŒŽ New Zealand`  
Vital builds software for care teams & patients, with a focus on the Emergency Room (ER) experience. We use AI/ML to transform the care experience, increase patient & staff satisfaction, and increase revenue for our clients. We provide hospitals with a modern UI and AI layer, which we are able to deploy within a matter of days.Vital is currently operating across more than 100 hospitals, integrated with over 30 healthcare systems, and is providing vital updates in care to over 1 million patients and loved ones across the United States. The future of healthcare is right here.  
This Role  
We are looking for a Staff Software Engineer to join our Shared Services team, as part of our wider Product Engineering group of teams. As part of Shared Services, youâ€™ll be responsible for systems that enrich and augment the data we receive, as well as the development of internal platforms that allow our Engineers to deliver features that summarise and translate medical jargon using AI, send alerts and updates, or display customised content in a patientâ€™s preferred language.  
As a remote-first company, the successful candidate can be based anywhere in New Zealand (or eastern parts of Australia). You will be working on all parts of the software stack for products which improve the healthcare experience for millions of patients and care teams.

### Engineering at Vital

  * Our engineers are responsible for maintaining and developing our customer-facing products, and internal tools that support them.
  * You will design, build and maintain features using a modern, serverless stack. All of our infrastructure rests within the AWS cloud, with our preference being AWS Managed Services, allowing our engineers to build products rather than maintain servers. Our products consist of mobile web applications (React + GraphQL) backed by DynamoDB and TypeScript Lambdas.
  * We ingest and process millions of events from core healthcare systems using Rhapsody Integration Engine, TypeScript Lambdas, Kinesis, and Databricks.
  * Code is deployed to production via CI/CD multiple times every day, with multiple layers of automated testing and code analysis in place. We prefer to catch potential issues as early as possible, so we continuously invest in our Developer Experience tooling.
  * Engineers build, maintain, and support shared services. As such, all of our engineering team (yes, including leadership) participate in our on-call roster.
  * Work is prioritised and delivered using a Kanban-style approach, and we constantly improve our methodology as needed. Features are launched in phases, following validation with our end users, so we rely heavily on feature flags.
  * Our team have adopted asynchronous communication as our preferred form of working together. We eschew unnecessary meetings, write documentation, draft idea documents, and utilise the Slack "Do Not Disturb" functionality.
  * Check out our dedicated Engineering career hub to learn more about each of the teams, and how we work together.

### What youâ€™ll bring with you:

  * Curiosity and drive are important - youâ€™ll be constantly improving and learning.
  * Strong proficiency in Typescript and the AWS ecosystem.
  * We're looking for engineers that have experienced the highs and lows of success and failure. Failures are often full of good lessons, we want you to bring these lessons to Vital.
  * You might not have formal management experience, but youâ€™ve had experience leading and supporting other engineers through coaching, mentoring, and collaboration.

### Responsibilities

  * Design, build, maintain and own features and functionality from concept to completion, write test plans, and own the operationalising of features.
  * Collaborate with Product, Quality and Engineering leads to develop strategies for launching and measuring success of products, features and functionality.
  * Design and architect solutions with our technical leaders. Take the lead on formulating the design as needed.
  * Develop and implement operationalising strategies with other members of the team to ensure we meet company goals around uptime, reliability, and scalability.
  * Proactively comb our services for bugs and issues. Lead the investigation, triage, and resolution of issues.
  * Enable the effectiveness of our teams by identifying and resolving gaps in documentation, team processes, and day-to-day workflow tooling. 
  * Champion engineering practices and lead by example to uphold team processes and standards.
  * Collate and communicate team and individual progress proactively across the company as needed, identify blocking issues, and forecast potential blockers.

### Benefits

  * Every team member at Vital gets to share in our success in the form of stock options.
  * Weâ€™ll provide you with the equipment youâ€™ll need to work remotely or in a shared office space.
  * Annual L&D budget to support your career development & a stipend for your home office set up!
  * Employee Assistance Program to support your wellbeing.
  * Paid Parental Leave.
  * Weâ€™re working on problems which have a real impact on peopleâ€™s lives. When we succeed, patients get better care.
  * Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are important to us. Every team member must abide by our shared code of conduct. We believe this approach will help us attract and grow a diverse bunch of talented people that are supportive, calm, clear, empathetic, and results-oriented.
  * We prefer working smarter, not longer. You're not expected to put in wild hours, that's just not what we do.
  * We're constantly improving our systems and processes, and you'll be expected to continue to shape this as we journey together.
