 **About the Team**

The technical support team leverages their extensive experience supporting large-scale Solr clusters and the Lucene/Solr ecosystem. Their day might include troubleshooting errors and attempting to fix or develop workarounds, diagnosing network and environmental issues, learning your customer's infrastructure and technologies, as well as reproducing bugs and opening Jira tickets for the engineering team. Their primary tasks are break/fix scenarios where the diagnostics quickly bring network assets back online and prevent future problems--which has a huge impact on our customersâ€™ business.

  

**About the Role**

As a Search Engineer in Technical Support, you will play a critical role in helping our clients achieve success with our products. You will be responsible for assisting clients directly in resolving any technical issues they encounter, as well as answering questions about the product and feature functionality. You will work closely with internal teams such as Engineering and Customer Success to resolve a variety of issues, including product defects, performance issues, and feature requests.

  

This role requires excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail, strong communication abilities, and a deep understanding of search technology. Additionally, this role requires the ability to work independently and as part of a team, and being comfortable working with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The successful candidate will demonstrate a passion for delivering an outstanding customer experience, balancing technical expertise with empathy for the customerâ€™s needs.

  

This is a remote role and will remain remote.
