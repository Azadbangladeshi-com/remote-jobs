Did you know that _queue_ is pronounced from only the letter "q" as the other four letters are waiting for their turn? Don't get the wrong idea though - our client's ticket queue is spick and span!

They are a leading Managed Services Provider who have a reputation for having the best customer service. They like to think of themselves as a community-centered organization: they have clients in different sectors within their region, and their mission is to help them succeed. Their values? To do it with empathy - they want to deliver friendly, caring, and responsive service 100% of the time.

They have a small and highly efficient team, and are looking to hire someone who enjoys working alongside customers to help them run their business reliably and seamlessly, and someone passionate about breaking down intricate problems. If you are comfortable working with a wide array of clients, and have strong customer service skills (for example, breaking down complex problems for a non-technical person to understand your solution), this could be a good place for you!

  * Ensure customer safety by maintaining data accuracy, security, and regulatory compliance.

  * Identify, diagnose, and resolve network issues, including connectivity and traffic utilization problems.
  * Provide infrastructure services, including operating system management, directory services, server virtualization, system backup and restore, network monitoring, and application installation and configuration.
  * Manage escalations from Level 1 Engineers, create documentation, and train other Engineers as needed.

**They require skills/experience with:**

  * 3+ years of experience as an IT Technician, preferably for an MSP (or serving multiple clients).
  * O365 administration.
  * Experience with an RMM tool such as Kaseya, and Autotask or similar
