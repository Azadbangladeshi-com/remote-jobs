## Description

 **About Starburst**

  

At Starburst, we are working to dismantle the status quo of data silos and vendor lock-in every single day. For decades, database companies have held their customers hostage and we believe thatâ€™s just plain wrong. Starburst offers a full-featured data lake analytics platform, built on open source Trino. Our platform includes all the capabilities needed to discover, organize, and consume data without the need for time-consuming and costly migration projects. Today more than 300 leading organizations trust us to make better decisions faster.

  

Though Starburst has raised $414M in venture funding from top investors, we were founded in a rather unusual way as we bootstrapped the business with customers and revenue from the very beginning! We are a remote-first company with employees all over the world and are proud to be named a Best Place to Work. Come join our team of All-Stars!

  

 **About the role**

  

This role will be the first member of the soon-to-be-formed Starburst Product Security team. Initially hands-on, you will be responsible for building and operating the foundational elements of the Product Security Program to ensure that Starburst applications are designed, developed, and maintained with robust security measures in place. As the business and the maturity of the Product Security Program evolve, this team will continue to scale to meet the growing demands.
