# [Software Engineer (Internship)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-internship-118171)  
### Synctera  
#### `ðŸŒŽ US or Canada (Remote)`  

## **What Weâ€™re Looking For**

As a software engineering intern, youâ€™ll be building tooling into our dashboard for advanced configuration of our tenants to empower our operational teams, banks, and FinTechs to self-serve. Youâ€™ll join our Application Experience team where you will play a crucial role in this configuration project in the Synctera Console.

Our dream candidate is a user-obsessed, enthusiastic team player who enjoys working closely with cross-functional team members and is eager to help solve a range of fun problems. Weâ€™re searching for someone with a passion to help drive change in financial services.

This opportunity is for a three-month term, with the option to extend.

## **What Youâ€™ll Do**

  * Develop amazing internal configuration tools
  * Work with team members and product managers to create amazing experiences
  * Envision cleaner, simpler ways to solve problems as a part of a small team
  * Keep learning, keep growing and help your team do the same
  * Work in close partnership with cross-functional teams

## **What Youâ€™ll Bring**

  * Experience with React, TypeScript, and React Hooks
  * Experience with Go or a similar structured and opinionated language is a plus but is **not** a requirement â€“ if youâ€™re solely comfortable on the frontend right now, please apply anyway!
  * Strong understanding of web fundamentals, including JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and RESTful APIâ€™s
  * Strong sense of style and design patterns and web architecture with a user-centric mindset
  * Strong problem-solving skills and ability to write clean, efficient, and scalable code
  * Curiosity and eagerness to understand problems and work with team members on solutions

## **Our Stack**

Our platform is built in Go (for backend services) and React with Typescript (for the Synctera Console, our frontend). Weâ€™re built on top of Google Cloud Platform and typically use Postgres (Cloud SQL, AlloyDB), Redis (Cloud Memorystore), and Pub/Sub as our core application stack, with OpenAPI specifications being used to both document our API and be the foundation for inter-service communication.

Our infrastructure is predominantly Kubernetes (Google Kubernetes Engine), with Terraform orchestrating infrastructure, and tools like Argo facilitating deployments.

## **Diversity & Inclusion**

Synctera is committed to having a workforce that is reflective of the diversity within the United States and Canada. As an equal opportunity employer, we encourage applications from candidates from underrepresented communities, Indigenous persons, persons with disabilities, persons of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, and all those who can provide different perspectives and contribute to the diversification of Synctera.

The range informed in this job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries across all US and Canadian locations. Within the range, individual pay will be determined by work location, job-related skills, experience, relevant training, and other factors._
