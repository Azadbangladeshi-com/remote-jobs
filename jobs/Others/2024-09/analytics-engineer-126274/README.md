Rec Room is the best place to build and play games together. Chat, hang out, explore MILLIONS of rooms, or build something new to share with us all! As an Analytics Engineer, you'll be a key member of a small team supporting our data warehouse and analytics layer, setting us up to scale in both the number of players and internal users. You will be supported by other analytics engineers, mentored and leveled to take on increasingly complex ELT and data modeling projects, and partner closely with teams such as Growth, Economy, User-generated Content, and Social, among others, empowering them to understand player behavior deeply.

**WHAT YOU'LL DO:**

  * Partner with PMs, designers, engineers, and analysts/data scientists to build out the data layer to empower analysis, experimentation, and new product features with the support of other senior engineers on the team.
  * Develop and maintain our ELT pipeline, which includes streaming, micro-batch, and daily batch load processes using tools such as Rudderstack, Fivetran, Prefect and DBT.
  * Develop data warehouse models on a Databricks SQL Warehouse using established patterns and processes that serve as the foundation for scaling our data.
  * Apply software engineering practices (e.g., code review, testing, version control, iterative development) when creating new datasets to ensure data quality across our pipelines and BI tools.
  * Work with the support of senior engineers, taking on increasingly complex projects. 
  * Design and implement top-level company dashboards to serve as the source of truth for company performance using tools such as Sigma and Hex.
  * Build out experimentation datasets and pipelines to allow for granular analysis of A/B tests.
  * Partner with ML teams to build out data models to be used in model deployment
  * Work with partner teams to build datasets that will impact production, such as creator and player statistics.
  * Be curious and constantly learning!

**WE ARE LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH:**

  * 3+ years of SQL development experience. Experience with cloud / MPP data warehouse solutions such as Databricks SQL Warehouse is preferred.
  * Solid proficiency in SQL (aggregate functions, window functions, complex joins, CTE), including query optimization skills.
  * Previous experience with pipeline orchestration. DBT and Prefect preferred.
  * Experience with dashboarding tools. Sigma and Hex experience is a plus.
  * Familiarity with processes for handling event-based data is a plus.
  * Experience with Python and Javascript is a plus.
