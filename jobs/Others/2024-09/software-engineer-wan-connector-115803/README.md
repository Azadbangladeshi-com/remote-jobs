# [Software Engineer - WAN Connector](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-wan-connector-115803)  
### Cloudflare  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Hybrid or Remote`  

**About the team**

Cloudflare is redefining the way networks are run at scale. Our Network Services product suite puts the connectivity, scale, and performance of Cloudflareâ€™s global network in front of customersâ€™ network infrastructure and private networks. Our team works with Rust, Go, Linux, and cloud technologies to simultaneously build on-prem operating systems and distributed cloud backends. We are looking for engineers who are just as interested in building their own Linux-based OS as they are in cloud architecture, and just as interested in Rust as they are in Go.

**Magic WAN Connector**

The Magic WAN Connector is a lightweight network appliance providing zero touch connectivity to the Cloudflare network, extending the power of the Cloudflare global network to customer locations, and providing local network access to Cloudflareâ€™s cloud-native networking services at the Edge. Connectors are deployed worldwide to customer locations and are managed via a cloud backend.

**About the role**

Weâ€™re looking for curious and empathetic engineers who are excited to join us in changing the way networking is done. Some of the things our team works on include:

  * A lightweight linux OS, with networking software written in Rust, deployed via physical devices and virtual machines
  * A distributed cloud backend using Go, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL
  * Debugging packet flows and IPsec tunnels that span the globally distributed Cloudflare network and globally distributed customer networks, often involving debugging of Linux kernel networking primitives â€“ netfilter, nftables, eBPF, tc, network namespaces, etc
  * Release/Deployment systems for various applications including operating systems and backend APIs
  * Partnering with some of the best engineers and product managers to solve big problems

**Desired skills, knowledge, and experience**

  * **Rust** and/or **Go** programming
  * Broad **networking** expertise across **L3-L7** networking flows and protocols
  * Experience designing and integrating **RESTful APIs** and backend systems
  * Experience building on top of Linux kernel networking primitives â€“ **netfilter, nftables, eBPF, tc, network namespaces** , etc
  * Experience building and shipping **highly distributed systems with best SRE practices**
  * Excellent **debugging** and optimization skills
  * Able to **work across teams** and level common, sustainable solutions
  * Focus on clarity in **written and verbal communication**
