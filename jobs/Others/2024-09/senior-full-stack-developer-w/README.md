We are a fully remote company working with a wide array of technologies and have expertise in every stage of the software development process.

In this opportunity, we are seeking a Senior Full-Stack Developer to work with one of our foreign clients, an independent, non-profit global research organization that turns big ideas into action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity, and human well-being.

  

In this role, you will collaborate with the data team to develop user-facing geospatial applications, data dashboards, and decision support tools to help cities address urban heat stress and access relevant data and knowledge to implement effective cooling infrastructures. You will work closely with product, design, and engineering teams to transform insights collected through discovery interviews with different urban heat actors and design wireframes tested with users into deployed live applications.

  

 **This is a part-time role.**
