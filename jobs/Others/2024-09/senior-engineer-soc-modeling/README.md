**What Youâ€™ll Do**

The Technology Enabling and Development (TED) Lab is part of Samsungâ€™s Memory Business Unit, the industry's technology and volume leader in DRAM, NAND Flash, and SRAM memory. TED has the charter to develop SSD for enterprise customers. More recently, TED has also been tasked to develop SSD controller architecture to support future enterprise SSD designs. We are an integral part of Samsungâ€™s strong R&D focus & lab innovation engine. We work closely with development teams across geographically distributed sites to bring innovation to enterprise SSD product road maps.

The successful SOC Architect candidate will be a key technical member of TED Controller Architecture Team and will be responsible for designing and developing high level architecture for SSD controllers. She or he will join a team of experts in researching and developing innovative high level controller chip architecture for data center/cloud and enterprise SSD. The ideal candidate must have prior experience developing high level chip and system architecture of leading-edge high performance SSD devices.

The SOC Architect will be responsible for developing, contributing, and leading ASIC high level-architecture activities in SSI storage-based controllers. The successful hire will have strong knowledge of latest trends in NVMe standards, data center/enterprise customer technical requirements, and knowledge/experience of end to end SSD controller chip architecture. The job scope will cover technical requirement analysis, architecture specifications, high level design/flows, and architecture modeling for architecture level assessment of high level building blocks and flows using state of the art advance development tools and methods before microarchitecture and RTL development.
