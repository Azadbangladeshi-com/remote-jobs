We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.

We aim to create a world where mental health is no longer stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an integral part of one's overall well-being.

We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.

 **About the Role**

Rula's mission is to make mental healthcare work for everyone: patients, therapists, and healthcare systems. As a member of Rula‚Äôs Scheduling team, you'll be shaping the scheduling experience and empowering them to deliver high-quality care via simple & delightful technology.

We are looking for candidates interested in working in a close-knit team within a fast-growing product.

As a Staff Engineer, you will get to work across all of Rula's stack by contributing directly to our product and its development and driving meaningful technical conversations and solution-oriented decisions.

Scheduling is a key functionality that touches multiple surfaces and applications at Rula. It is the core experience that facilitates appointments between patients and providers, which is the bread and butter of Rula‚Äôs business. Key capabilities include allowing providers to set their availability upfront, managing appointments, and enabling patients to view availability and book appointments. This team will own the Electronic Health Record System (EHR) interactions in this area, make Rula the source of truth for this data, and increase resilience by not being dependent on the uptime SLAs of the EHR. This is a backend leaning role.
