**Senior Site Reliability Engineer, Databases**

**Summary**

The Wikimedia Foundation is seeking a Senior Site Reliability Engineer (Databases).

  * Experience with MariaDB or MySQL database administration and replication topologies at scale
  * Proficiency in SQL
  * Solid knowledge of relational database concepts and working experience with storage systems and architectures
  * Experience with LAMP stack technologies (PHP/HHVM, memcached/Redis) - MediaWiki experience is a definite plus
  * Experience with advanced distributed storage and database systems (Swift, Ceph, Cassandra, etc.) is a **big** plus
  * Experience in architecture, design, and implementation of persistent data storage & query infrastructure
  * Strong track record of open source contributions is a major plus
