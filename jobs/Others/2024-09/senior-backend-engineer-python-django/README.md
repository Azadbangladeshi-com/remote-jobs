As a backend engineer, you will be working with cutting edge technology and new product development in a stable and rapidly growing company. You will be partnering with our product and tech leads to design and architect new features. This is an individual contributor role, and you will be empowered to make your own decisions about implementations and given autonomy to complete your work at your own pace.

  * Experience with Elasticsearch a plus

  * Excellent communication skills; you can articulate clearly, thoroughly, and concisely to technical and non-technical audiences
  * Comfortability with the entire development life cycle (inception to release) in an Agile environment
