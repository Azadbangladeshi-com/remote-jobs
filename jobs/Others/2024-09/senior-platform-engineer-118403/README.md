# [Senior Platform Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-platform-engineer-118403)  
### Shakepay  
#### `üåé Remote, Canada`  

At Shakepay, we‚Äôre on a mission to usher in the Bitcoin golden age. We‚Äôre reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake.

Our culture is built around doing work that matters, winning as a team, and celebrating success. If you're the kind of person who values growth, shipping fast, and sharing your ideas openly with a group of like-minded people, come and build with us!

#### **About Shakepay**

Since 2015, we‚Äôve been building the Shakepay app to make buying and earning bitcoin fast, easy, and secure. In 2022, we launched the Shakepay Card, allowing shakers to earn bitcoin rewards when they shop. Today, more than one million Canadians use Shakepay to grow their bitcoin savings and take control of their financial future.

We‚Äôre regulated across all Canadian provinces and territories, and backed by renowned venture capitalists with a funding of $44M. We have a passionate, loyal, and growing community, and we‚Äôre looking for people who want to help us build something truly special.

#### Senior Platform Engineer

Imagine shaking your phone to instantly earn bitcoin. Our customers might think it‚Äôs magic, but if you‚Äôre reading this you probably know that it‚Äôs not (or is it?). It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs our stellar dev team that makes it happen. That shaking idea started as a secret easter-egg for our fledgling customer base, and once word got out about it, we suddenly had to deal with service outages from too many people shaking at the same time.

Of course we‚Äôve since solved that problem, and now with over 1,000,000 shakers (aka ‚Äúcustomers''), it‚Äôs a core part of our identity‚Äînot the shaking, but the idea that we came up with something new and exciting in the slow and boring world of financial services. We‚Äôre looking for a Senior Software Engineer to help us reimagine how Canadians build wealth and think about what they can do with their money. Unique ideas and the knowledge and determination to make them a reality: that‚Äôs the real magic.
