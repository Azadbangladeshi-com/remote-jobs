## Description

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers. We founded our company on the insight that while there were excellent tools for developers to build better code, there were no similarly great tools to help ML practitioners build better models. Starting with our first experiment tracking product, we have since expanded our solution into a comprehensive AI developer platform for organizations focused on building their own deep learning models and generative AI applications.

  

Weights & Biases is a Series C company with $250M in funding and over 200 employees. We proudly serve over 1,000 customers and more than 30 foundation model builders including customers such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Toyota.

  

The Software Engineer for Platform Tooling will report to the Enterprise Engineering Manager. This person will be responsible for setting up and maintaining infrastructure standards.

  

In addition, this role will play a pivotal role in tool development both externally and internally. You'll help make it possible to deploy our software to our enterprise customers, establishing a strong foundation of technical excellence for our diversified customer base.

  

This role will also establish firm partnerships with our enterprise customers, which will boost customer satisfaction and lead to more comprehensive solutions.

  

The Platform Tooling team manages the variances in infrastructure types and implementing suitable solutions that cater to the unique needs of each enterprise customer. You will leverage your skills, knowledge, and adaptability to navigate this complex landscape, consistently providing high-quality solutions to our customers.
