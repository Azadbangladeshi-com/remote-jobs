  * Positivity and solution focused.
  * Independently motivated.

**Additionally, weâ€™d love you to fit _one_ of three skill sets:**

  * **ML infrastructure:** You have interest and experience in building backend production ML systems. You understand how real world MLOps systems work and how to use infrastructure to maximize the performance of models. 
  * **Model development and maintenance:** You have interest and experience converting a model from a researcher into an efficient, high performing production ML service. You understand how to expand on the work of a researcher to develop and maintain models in production.
  * **ML product Integration:** You have interest and experience in helping front-end and feature product teams effectively use machine learning models. You understand the needs and challenges of product teams using machine learning and have built services that help make ML-related work of those teams easier and faster.
