**Why work at Blue Coding?**

  

At Blue Coding we specialize in hiring excellent developers and amazing people from all over Latin America and other parts of the world. For the past 10 years, weâ€™ve helped cutting-edge companies in the United States and Canada -both large and small, build great development teams and develop great products. Online shops, digital agencies, SaaS providers, and software consulting firms are a few of our clients. Our team of over 100 engineers is distributed in more than 10 countries across the Americas. We are a fully remote company working with a wide array of technologies and have expertise in every stage of the software development process.

  

Our team is highly connected, united, and culturally diverse, and our collaborators are involved in many initiatives around the world, from wildlife preservation to volunteering at local charities. We also participate in group activities like movie nights, trivia, and meme competitions. We stand for honesty, fairness, respect, efficiency, hard work, and cooperation.

  

 **What are we looking for?**

  

In this opportunity, we are looking for an experienced DevSecOps Engineer to work with one of our US clients, a corporation that, through its subsidiaries, provides life insurance protection targeted to the middle American market. The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing and maintaining systems in their enterprise data and analytics environments. You will develop deep knowledge of our client's businesses as you help optimize performance by building and supporting decision-making tools. You will partner closely with their software engineering, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, and DevOps/SysOps teams to deliver best-in-class data solutions that empower enterprise-wide reporting and analytics, including business-critical vendor relationships.

  

If you are independent, a great communicator, attentive to detail, and a problem solver, this is a great fit for you! Our jobs are fully remote and flexibleâ€”as long as you have the skills and can get the work done well, you can work anywhere in the listed countries (and anytime) you want.

  

  

 **What's unique about this job?**

  

As a member of the DevSecOps team, you will be building, automating, securing, and evolving the software, infrastructure, and technologies that our products depend on. This role focuses on modernizing and migrating our existing on-premises infrastructure into a cloud-native infrastructure. As a contributor to an agile team, you will work with development teams towards automating everything from building CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, and application deployment to all dev, test, and production environments, securing and monitoring these systems.
