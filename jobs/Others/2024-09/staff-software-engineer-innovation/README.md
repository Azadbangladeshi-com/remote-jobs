At PlayStation, we believe that innovation is at the core of what makes us the Best Place to Play and the Best Place to Work. Since the launch of the original PlayStation in 1994, weâ€™ve been a global leader in interactive and digital entertainment. As part of Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation, we continue to push boundaries, redefine entertainment, and inspire the world.

## The Innovation Team

Our mission is to drive innovation across PlayStation by exploring new opportunities and applying cutting-edge technology to solve real-world challenges. Weâ€™re a team that values curiosity, creativity, and collaboration.

You will work closely with a diverse team of engineers, designers, researchers, producers, and project managers to rapidly prototype and learn about new ideas, testing market feasibility, desirability, and viability.

You will be a key player in our journey to discover and define new ideas. We will look to this role to help define possibility spaces, to be a strong collaborator in written word and in brainstorming and concepting. We will be leaning on this person to be comfortable seeding many good ideas that may end up not growing than someone who wants to build and ship AAA video games.

This role is perfect for someone who thrives in an environment where creativity and technical excellence intersect to ask the right questions, collect the right data, and present the right solution design to answer those questions in a rapid, fun, and exciting team dynamic that is unlike anything in the industry.

  * Rapid Prototyping: Quickly develop and iterate on prototypes based on user feedback and testing, focusing on delivering high-quality, impactful solutions.
  * Technical Leadership: Provide technical guidance and mentorship to other team members, helping to elevate the teamâ€™s overall capability and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

  * Thought Leadership: Represent the Innovation team within the broader PlayStation organization, sharing knowledge and advocating for best practices in software development and innovation.
  * Effective Communication: Clearly articulate ideas and technical concepts in briefs and presentations, using tools like Notion, Figma, PowerPoint, and other collaborative software.

**Qualifications:**

  * Demonstrable previous experience at scale: Deep understanding of architecture, tools, and workflows, for delivering software that is just-in-time and right-sized to exactly what the team needs to move forward.
  * Advanced Programming Skills: Proficiency in C++, JavaScript, Python, or Java is required for this role, and experience with programming within Unreal Engine is desired, though not required for this role.
  * Performance Optimization: Strong familiarity with optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU performance.
  * Networking Systems: Knowledge of multiplayer networking systems within Unreal Engine.
  * Shader Development: Experience in creating and optimizing shaders using HLSL or similar languages.
  * AI Systems: Experience with AI systems and behavior development in Unreal Engine.
  * Problem-Solving: Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to troubleshoot complex technical issues.
  * Cross-functional Experience: Demonstrated experience working on cross-functional teams, collaborating with project managers, engineers, designers, and researchers.
  * Leadership Potential: A demonstrated ability to lead projects, mentor team members, and contribute to strategic decision-making.

  * Resilient Problem-Solver: A person who embraces failure as a learning opportunity and who is driven by the pursuit of excellence. No sacred cows. If it doesnâ€™t work, itâ€™s okay.
  * Happy Recalibrator: We may need to contribute to multiple projects at once, or jump from one project to another, or put a project on hold or compost entirely due to things we learn on the way. 
  * Smart Worker: An individual who knows when to build, what to build, and when to pivot, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in every project.

**Join Us** If youâ€™re ready to be a leader in a team thatâ€™s shaping the future of play, we want to hear from you. This is an opportunity to make a significant impact, to lead with innovation, and to be part of something truly extraordinary.
