# [Software Engineer, Simulation](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-simulation-119026)  
### Collaborative Robotics  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote, United States`  

Do you dream about a synthetic world full of robots interacting with virtual humans? Do you follow the latest developments in efficient and accurate contact simulation? Do you regularly read the specs of the latest graphics cards and their new capabilities to see how much further you can push your simulation tools? Are you excited about developing simulation tools that accelerate the development and deployment of real-world robots?

Simulation is at the core of everything we do at Collaborative Robotics. A world-class simulation platform is foundational to developing a trustworthy robot capable of working alongside humans in a wide diversity of process paths.

As a software engineer in simulation, you will be responsible for modeling the robot and the world in simulation, as well as building the tooling to enable full digital twin development and testing, not just for our internal teams but for our partners as well.

_This role is located at our Santa Clara, CA headquarters, Seattle, WA office, or remotely within the US._

**Builder Opportunity:**

  * Build the simulation foundation for developing a trustworthy robot.
  * Model the robot and the world in simulation.
  * Develop the tooling to enable full digital twin development and testing, not just for our internal teams but for our partners as well. 

**Minimum Qualifications:**

  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science or related technical field.
  * 2+ years of experience working directly within engineering teams.
  * Hands-on experience implementing or building upon simulation frameworks.
  * Hands-on experience using simulations to accelerate development or test.
  * Proficiency in Python or C++ and willingness to pick up new languages or technologies as needed.
  * Strong mathematical fundamentals in 3D geometry, linear algebra, probability theory, physics, dynamics, or numerical modeling.
  * Enjoy working in a fast paced, collaborative and dynamic start-up environment as part of a small team.
  * Pragmatic, customer-focused.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

  * Masterâ€™s or PhD degree in computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering.
  * Experience with dynamic physical system modeling and simulation. Contacts, collisions, controls, dynamics, sensor and actuator modeling.
  * Full-stack experience from GPU through to 3D asset modeling and everything in-between.
  * Experience using massively parallel simulation in order to train deep learning models. 
  * Direct experience with Isaac and/or Ignition/Gazebo. 
  * Experience with sim-to-real comparisons, fidelity, and validation. 
  * Experience with ROS2.
  * Experience with low-level physics APIs.
  * First-hand experience with robotic or autonomous vehicle simulations.

_The base salary range for this position is $160,000 - $180,000 plus equity and comprehensive benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and experience level. The range reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for the position across all locations in the United States. Within the range, individual pay is determined by additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training._
