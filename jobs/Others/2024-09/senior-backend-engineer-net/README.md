#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote, Philippines`  

**Karbon** is looking for senior software engineers skilled in balancing efficiency and excellence. Ideal candidates thrive in teamwork, innovate, and maintain products while valuing autonomy and creativity. We prioritize ownership and impact, welcoming diversity, passion, and authenticity in a collaborative, sincere environment.

#### Key Responsibilities

  * Balance Speed and Qualityâ€”You adeptly balance the need for speed with a commitment to quality. You know when to accelerate to meet deadlines and when to focus on detail for perfect outcomes. You have the judgment to navigate these priorities effectively, maintaining a keen eye for both efficiency and excellence.
  * Work effectively as part of a teamâ€”Software development is a team sport, where solo victories are rare. It thrives on your robust collaboration and dedication to supporting your colleagues. You contribute to a harmonious blend of focused work and engaging discussions, flexible between home and office settings, ensuring everyone can contribute to the team's success. You are eager to be part of an exceptional team, ready to invest your efforts towards collective achievements.
  * Build and maintainâ€”Your role involves developing innovative products and ensuring the continuous operation of existing ones. You appreciate not only the allure of new technologies but also the importance of iterative improvements on established systems. Your commitment to pioneering and preservation is crucial.
  * Autonomyâ€”You are inherently curious, finding joy in learning and exploration. Faced with challenges and direction rather than predefined solutions, you engage fully and creatively with problems.
  * Own your workâ€”You take genuine pride in your creations, feeling a deep sense of responsibility for the products you develop and their impact on customers. This sense of ownership is paramount, and you share this commitment.
  * Bring your passion and personalityâ€”Your creativity, curiosity, and authentic self make the team stronger. If you've worked in highly political environments, you'll find our culture, free from office politics and valuing openness and authenticity, a refreshing change.

#### Qualifications

  * We are primarily a .NET-focused team, seeking candidates proficient in C#, SQL Server, and .NET technologies (MVC, Web API, .NET Core). That said, candidates with demonstrated ability to repeatedly and successfully adapt to new technologies over several years will also be considered.
  * Team versatility is important, so experience with JavaScript/TypeScript is considered a plus. 
  * Strong communication skills are essential for our international, multi-locational team dynamics.
  * Candidates should understand scalable systems, software architecture, data structures, and algorithms. 
  * Familiarity with the full software development life cycle and engineering best practices is required.
  * A Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience is needed.
