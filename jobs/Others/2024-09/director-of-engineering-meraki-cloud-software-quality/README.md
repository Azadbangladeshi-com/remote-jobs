At Cisco Meraki, our intuitive platform enables organizations of all sizes to deliver customer and employee experiences at scale. To provide best-in-class technologies to our customers, we've created an unrivaled company culture for our employees. One that is collaborative, flexible, and inclusive and provides employees with the autonomy to develop technology that's intuitive, secure, and accessible for everyone.

As head of Meraki Cloud Software Quality, you will lead the teams responsible for automating the testing of cross-product aspects of the Meraki Cloud Platform and building the tools and environments to enable this testing. You will work closely with engineering and product leaders to define quality standards and articulate and implement a vision for overall testing methodology to meet those standards.

Above all else, success in these efforts will depend on your ability to support the team and build strong relationships with developer and product management partners. The Meraki engineering culture is highly collaborative, so the test engineers work closely with the developers they support, and both testers and developers will use the tooling built by your team.

## **You will:**

  * Partner with the head of Meraki Cloud and other senior leaders to set quality standards
  * Work with other engineering leaders to articulate the technical vision and short and long-term plans for how Cloud functionality is tested
  * Lead the development of standardized testing frameworks and environments to enable functional, integration, system, and scale testing across Meraki engineering
  * Provide updates to senior leadership, including the CTO, on the state of Cloud Quality
  * Mentor and coach managers and senior test engineers through technical and non-technical challenges
  * Develop career plans for people on your team and help them do the same for theirs
  * Encourage thoughtful and creative ways to recognize achievement
  * Lead performance, compensation, and promotion review processes
  * Provide thoughtful counsel as a member of senior engineering leadership
  * Assist with engineering-wide initiatives such as offsites, training, and process evolution

## **You are an ideal candidate if you:**

  * Have extensive software quality experience (10+ years) testing cloud applications primarily through automated testing
  * Have experience defining and building test environments
  * Have experience defining quality metrics
  * Have experience testing cloud applications at scale
  * Have experience managing through managers
  * Have experience building a team, making decisions on recruiting, and organization design
  * Have excellent communication skills and can articulate a compelling vision
  * Have experience partnering closely with software developers and leadership, as well as product management
  * Have the empathy and emotional intelligence to lead a diverse group of engineers and managers at varying stages of their careers

## **Bonus points:**

  * A degree or equivalent experience in Computer Science or Engineering or a related field
  * Experience building a test pipeline in a CI/CD environment
  * Experience with test frameworks such as Cypress
  * Understanding of networking

We encourage you to drop us a line even if you donâ€™t have all the points above. Thatâ€™s a lot of different areas of responsibility! We will help you pick them up because we believe that great leaders come from a diverse set of backgrounds.

_At Cisco Meraki, weâ€™re challenging the status quo with the power of diversity, inclusion, and collaboration. When we connect different perspectives, we can imagine new possibilities, inspire innovation, and release the full potential of our people. Weâ€™re building an employee experience that includes appreciation, belonging, growth, and purpose for everyone._
