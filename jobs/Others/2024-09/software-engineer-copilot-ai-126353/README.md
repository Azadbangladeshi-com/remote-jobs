 **About the team:** The AI Copilot team is focused on building a copilot platform experience where users can optimize their digital advertising campaigns by blending an LLM chat-based copilot with the precision and control of traditional UI elements. Our approach ensures users can navigate complex setups by expressing their intentions, such as targeting specific audiences or setting campaign budgets, with the copilot automatically configuring the UI and offering clear, actionable suggestions based on campaign insights.

  

The team is also improving our internal copilot that currently answers hundreds of questions from StackAdapters on a daily basis. Our vision is to advance our internal copilotâ€™s capabilities to be a subject matter expert that StackAdapters can consult with to better plan & execute their campaigns in verticals theyâ€™re unfamiliar with.
