**The Role:**

FilmFreeway is seeking a **Senior Ruby Engineer** to build and optimize the best user-focused product serving the film industry. Our small but mighty engineering team of two.

You will be partnering with our product and customer support teams to design and architect new features that will solve the pain points of our customers. While this is an individual contributor role, you will also be guiding technical decisions, and providing code reviews. Your work will have a direct impact on our very fast-growing community and will be seen and used by millions of people around the world!
