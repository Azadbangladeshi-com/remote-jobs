### **About The Role:**

If you like working in a small and fun startup environment where you'll have full ownership to deliver tangible results, Insightly is the right place for you!

We are looking for a Senior Software Developer I to join our engineering team. You will design, develop, and maintain the Insightly Platform of Apps, Apis, Integrations, and Peripherals.

In this role, you will be working closely as part of a smart and collaborative team that is developing highly scalable cloud-based CRM services for small and medium businesses. Those include CRM, Marketing, Service, and App Marketplace.

### **What you‚Äôll be doing:**

  * Building highly scalable web applications for over millions of users
  * Designing and implementing effective and elegant solutions to support complex operations and architectures
  * Taking full ownership of the entire engineering ecosystem required to deliver features and results to business stakeholders and customers
  * Collaborating and working with the engineering team in an Agile environment
  * Establishing good engineering practices and mentoring other team members. You will mentor and be a resource for all SWE I & II Engineers

### **A little bit about you:**

  * You are a full-stack, Senior Engineer / generalist. Experience and (just as important) interest in working in a variety of layers and technologies within a SOA are a must for our team
  * This includes (walking down the stack): development, MVC-based web architecture, external RESTful APIs, distributed (and in our case, highly scaled) request handling services, SQL and relational databases, big data processing (e.g. data bus architecture) working in more than one, as well as eagerness to work on projects that might slice through them all (because they often will)
  * You have a track record of significant, specific, and self-directed contributions to large and challenging projects
  * You lead with humility and confidence. Our engineers have the opportunity - and are expected - to exercise a high degree of leadership and expertise in their daily work, having strongly held and defensible ideas, and advocating for what they believe is right. But they also need to be eager to hear differing opinions, adept at identifying and evaluating tradeoffs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to help out their fellow teammates
  * You have 5+ years of product-driven software development experience using a modern, object-oriented language. Memory-managed languages are best -- .e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. We do a lot of development in C#/.NET, but specific experience here is not required  
  

**What‚Äôs in it for you:**

üíµ Compensation range

For US applicants

  * $130,000 - $140,000 USD

For Canadian applicants

  * $117,399 - $138,000 CAD

ü©∫ Health and wellness

üéì Growth

üåü More perks!

### **Share our values:**

  * Customer First
  * Bias for Action
  * High Velocity Decision Making
  * Value Individuality
  * Results Focused
