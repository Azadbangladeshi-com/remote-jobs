  * Contribute to an internal self-service infrastructure platform used by all engineers for application development and deployment.
  * Participate in a weekly on-call rotation shared between offices in the US and India, which includes responding to production incidents and providing internal support to other engineers at Vimeo
  * Whatever it takes (within reason) to make Vimeo faster, simpler, more scalable, more reliable, and more efficient to operate

**Skills and knowledge you should possess:**
