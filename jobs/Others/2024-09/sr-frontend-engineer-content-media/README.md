This high-stakes effort is a multi-year undertaking that will modernize, simplify, and expand the capabilities of our product. This is the biggest upgrade to the product we have made in years.

As a part of this new initiative, we are building out a brand new team that will be tasked with integrating our existing (Rails) backend stack with a brand new frontend application. This team is tasked with building an _excellent_ web experience that unifies Vimeo‚Äôs Content and Media feature set from across OTT, Vimeo Core, and On-Demand into a singular product offering.

The Media Unification undertaking presents a unique opportunity to integrate features from across systems into a product with an already-established customer base. As the founding engineer on this new team, you will be empowered to establish not only the technical bar for what we build, but more importantly, you‚Äôll get to shape the team‚Äôs values, culture, and standards, as well as our philosophies around collaboration, diversity, and inclusion.

  * Write well-tested, performant, and accessible code for a new web platform experience using React, Next.js, and other frameworks when they are the right tool for the job.
  * Drive the technical research, planning, and execution of a new core web experience that will unlock an even richer toolset on top of a best-in-class platform.
  * Grow your technical expertise to become an effective collaborator with other teams and disciplines on complex integrations and innovative technical solutions.
  * Develop, refine, and uphold best practices and standards, and become a trusted engineering leader.

**Skills and knowledge that you have:**

  * You have 5+ years of experience shipping high-impact, well-factored features in React, or other frontend frameworks.
  * You‚Äôre an expert in modern web development concepts and best practices.
  * You have a strong understanding of polished, high-caliber web experiences (and an intuition for how they should be built), as well as a solid grasp of web accessibility standards and design system principles.
  * You have a ‚Äúget to the bottom of it‚Äù attitude; you‚Äôre comfortable with ambiguity and willing‚Äîexcited, even!‚Äîto dig into problems that don‚Äôt have straightforward solutions.
  * You prioritize shipping user value and focus on making an impact for users.
  * You always strive to write high-quality code and automated tests, and you care about the details.
  * You communicate well verbally and in writing, across different kinds of audiences.
  * You‚Äôre an inveterate learner, highly curious, unafraid to jump out of the plane and build your parachute on the way down (metaphorically speaking).
