### Tubi  
#### `ðŸŒŽ San Francisco, CA; Remote`  

#### About the Role:

In this Software Engineering role, you will be expected to lead by example as you enable your team to build out real-time systems to handle data at a massive scale. You will set the culture, build best practices, and set expectations for how the team works with data. You will work closely with cross-functional partners, including product teams, data scientists, and other engineers to unlock the potential of our data. As a senior engineer on the team, you will also mentor newer engineers along the way. You should be adaptable, curious, and have a solid foundation in big data and engineering fundamentals since you will do everything from building efficient pipelines, helping data scientists and analysts get the data they need, and even building out specific data products to help non-engineering teams get better insight into their unique datasets.

#### Your Responsibilities:

  * Be the primary owner of your product's data needs. That means everything from raw data ingestion to end-user analysis
  * Build intuitive, easy-to-use, and high-quality datasets using Spark or similar technologies
  * Track down data quality issues when they arise, and set appropriate data quality monitors and alerts to help prevent future incidents
  * Really understand your product's datasets with excellent communication skills to document and educate your team on how certain tables/fields are meant to be used
  * Be the liaison between the product team and the core data infrastructure team to make sure business needs are met in a computationally efficient manner
  * Design, build, and maintain Scala services at scale
  * Participate in the occasional daytime on-call rotation

#### Your Background:

  * 7+ years of software and/or data engineering experience building scalable, flexible, and always-on data pipelines
  * Strong experience using Spark, preferably using Scala but pySpark is also acceptable
  * Experience with efficiently working with datasets at a PB scale
  * Familiarity with Databricks, AWS, Redshift, and DBT
  * Knowledge of ClickHouse and/or Flink are a strong plus
  * Strong experience in JVM language (Scala is not required, but preferred)
