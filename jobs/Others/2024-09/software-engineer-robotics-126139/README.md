### Collaborative Robotics  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote, United States`  

Are you passionate about developing cutting-edge algorithms for autonomous robots? Do you thrive on iterative research and development of robot algorithms for autonomous motion? Is your expertise centered around crafting robust on-robot software that drives autonomy and reliability?

At Collaborative Robotics, the development of on-robot software is at the core of our mission to create highly reliable, fully autonomous, and collaborative robots. As a Software Engineer in Robotics, you will play a crucial role in enhancing our current software stack and driving the design and implementation of next-generation robotic capabilities.

Collaborative Robotics is a team of innovators and builders redefining the future of human-robot interaction. We are working to realize a world where robots are a trusted extension of your surroundings. They work, adapt, and react around you. Not the other way around.

_This role is located at our Santa Clara, CA headquarters, Seattle office, or remotely within the US._

**Key Responsibilities:**

  * Develop on-robot algorithms for autonomous behaviors such as navigation and path planning.
  * Push the envelope on what current state of the art sensors can do through advanced algorithm development.
  * Implement, debug, test and maintain on-robot software features.
  * Root cause software failures and bugs and use learnings to improve process and testing.
  * Write software across the full-stack on-robot to enable new capabilities.
  * Create reliable robotic system performance through robust algorithm development, success measurement, and recovery actions.

**Minimum Qualifications:**

  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science or a related technical field.
  * Experience implementing production-grade, high-reliability softwares.
  * Experience with C++ and Python.
  * Proficiency in a core autonomous mobile robot technology such as path planning, navigation, or obstacle avoidance.
  * Highly motivated teammate with excellent oral and written communication skills
  * Enjoy working in a fast paced, collaborative and dynamic start-up environment as part of a small team.
  * Willing to occasionally travel.
  * Must have and maintain US work authorization.

**Preferred Qualifications:**

  * Advanced degree (Masterâ€™s or PhD) in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering or similar field.
  * 2+ years of full-time work experience in Industry engineering teams.
  * Familiarity with machine learning.
  * Experience with simulation.
  * Experience with obstacle detection, mapping, or scene perception.
  * Developed software on a robot or autonomous system that was deployed in the field.

_The base salary range for this position is $160,000 - $180,000 plus equity and comprehensive benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and experience level. The range reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for the position inclusive of all locations within the United States. Within the range, individual pay is determined by additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training._
