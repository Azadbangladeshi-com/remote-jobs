At Ably we‚Äôre not just witnessing this revolution - we‚Äôre powering it.

At the heart of our mission lies a commitment to putting developers first. Ably provides a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime, delivering billions of messages for millions of devices every day and supporting organizations like Split, Hubspot, Toyota and Genius Sports.

Working at Ably means helping to build the infrastructure and technology that will power and shape the future of the internet. The opportunity in front of us is immense. And we‚Äôd like your help.

##  **About this role**

You will be responsible for helping shape the future of our frontends, making decisions that have a long lasting impact by building and delivering improvements and new features to our documentation, customer dashboards, and internal tools.

You‚Äôll be working closely with our Product and Design teams towards achieving the strategic goals of the company, with a core focus on improving the journey for developers who sign up to using Ably. You‚Äôll also work with people all across Ably as the projects we work on touch many different parts of the company.

## **Day to day you will**

  * **Create real value for Ably.** You‚Äôll be a key member of the Web team, contributing to strategic initiatives that drive developers to the Ably website, as well as increase sign ups and engagement over time.
  * **Deliver quality code.** You‚Äôll be hands-on with development to build and deliver improvements and new features to Ably‚Äôs customer-facing and internal frontends.
  * **Level up your team.** You‚Äôll be helping steer the direction of our frontends, including our component library, used by multiple teams to deliver a consistent identity for Ably no matter where people see us online.
  * **Collaborate effectively.** You‚Äôll be working closely with our Product & Design teams towards achieving the strategic goals of the company. You‚Äôll also work with people all across Ably as the projects we work on touch many different parts of the company.
  * **Focus on continual improvement.** Whether it‚Äôs deliberately refactoring code to make our lives easier or updating our processes to be more effective, you‚Äôll work to improve frontend development through improved engineering practices.
  * **Develop effective testing strategies.** You‚Äôll be expected to test your own work, leaning on automation as much as possible. You‚Äôll constantly influence how we can improve our testing setup, helping the team unlock more potential along the way. When needed you‚Äôll walk your team members and stakeholders through how to best test your work before it goes into production.

## **More generally you will**

  * **Handle security disclosures.** We have an active vulnerability disclosure program, and from time to time you‚Äôll be responsible for helping to resolve some extremely creative reports from security researchers.
  * **Support internal users.** We help support our internal users when they have issues with our systems, or if they can‚Äôt help resolve a customer issue without our intervention.
  * **Take responsibility for general maintenance.** You'll review and handle dependency updates from Dependabot (both security and general, we like to stay fresh). Deal with Sentry reports that are affecting customers.

## **We'd love to hear from you if you have**

  * Strong Ruby & Ruby on Rails skills and significant professional experience using these technologies.
  * Proficiency with modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Our frontends are a mix of technologies, and you‚Äôll be supported by great frontend developers.
  * A full-stack mindset and experience building full-stack applications with CI/CD, as well as understand and promote the importance of the latter.
  * Experience with writing automated tests for software with tools like RSpec, Cypress (or Capybara/Cucumber).
  * Cross-functional team experience. You have worked closely with designers and product managers in short, effective feedback loops.
  * A solid grasp of Agile, Kanban and SCRUM principles and experience working with stakeholders to create and manage backlogs and delivery of work.
  * Experience in dynamic, early stage startups where adaptability and resourcefulness are crucial.
  * A transparent and collaborative ‚Äúbuild in the open‚Äù mindset.

## **It would be great, but not essential if you have**

  * Experience delivering developer-focussed products or services.
  * Experience with products or services that are brought to market primarily through a product led growth approach.
  * Experience with modern frameworks such as React, Gatsby & TailwindCSS.
  * Experience with OpenAPI (Swagger) for customer-facing APIs.
  * Experience debugging in production on platforms like Heroku or Kubernetes.
