**  

  * **Do good, better:** We exclusively serve clients who make a positive impact on the world. This is your chance to build things that help create a better place for all of us.
  * **4-day work week and lots of holidays.** Mondays are flex days, meaning youâ€™re free to take them off if youâ€™re caught up on your work. Plus, weâ€™re closed for nearly a full week at Thanksgiving (November), and two weeks at the end of the year, plus a bunch of other days, too. Work-life balance FTW!
  * **High performance, no jerks.** Youâ€™ll collaborate with good people who believe in doing great work.
  * **Best Place to Work (and thatâ€™s not just our opinion).** Weâ€™ve been named a Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and Washington Business Journal.

We value team members who are motivated by our mission and driven to make a positive impact. If you have a passion for excellence, a growth mindset, and a commitment to collaboration, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

  * Help expand our codebase, workflows, and tools, while maintaining focus on reliability and scalability
  * Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback to foster a culture of continuous improvement
  * Work on complex projects involving advanced technologies and integrations, alongside our core offerings (like WordPress)

**  
To succeed in this position, youâ€™ll need:  
**  

  * Extensive experience with WordPress development, including custom plugins, functionality, themes, data structures, and integrations

  * Experience working with modern frontend frameworks and libraries like React or VueJS 
  * A solution-oriented mentality and the perspective, context, and awareness to solve complex problems in a sustainable way 
  * 5+ years of experience building cool stuff for the internet, and a commitment to continuous learning (for yourself and others)
  * Availability to work at least 5 hours overlap with 9-5pm ET
  * A genuine desire to make a positive impact through quality work

**  

Youâ€™ll get a flexible schedule, unlimited time off, a competitive salary, a profit share bonus (starting in your second year), the ability to work wherever you want, a personal development budget, and all US federal holidays and multiple weeks off at the end of the year to recharge. Weâ€™ll also offset your entire carbon footprint. If youâ€™re in the US, we also offer health insurance, disability and life insurance, and 401(k) matching.
