### Jamf  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ Remote,Czech Republic`  

At Jamf, people are at the core of everything we do. We do whatâ€™s right for our customers, our employees, our communities and our world. We take pride in simplifying technology for tens of thousands of customers around the globe and helping organizations succeed with Apple.

Jamf offers remote and hybrid positions. Depending upon the role, work in the office, connect 100% remote from your home, or find the blend that works best for you.

Many organizations with Apple also have non-Apple devices, thus, itâ€™s critical that device management and endpoint security solutions leverage the unique capabilities and features of each ecosystem. We can only serve our customers best when we work across multiple platforms and device types â€” including Android â€” which is why it is essential for Jamf to hire from a broad experience pool.

This role is remote in the Czech Republic. We are only able to accept applications for those based in the Czech Republic and have sponsorship to live and work in the Czech Republic.

### **What you'll do at Jamf:**

At Jamf, we empower people to be their best selves and do their best work.

We are seeking a highly skilled and experienced Senior Android Developer to join our talented mobile development team. In this role, you will be responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining high-quality Android application that pushes the boundaries of what is possible on the Android platform. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to deliver outstanding user experiences that delight our customers.

Our Jamf Trust Android App provides unified cloud security and connectivity for remote workers. We also provide enterprise-level security whilst protecting customerâ€™s privacy. Remote access ensures that our customers always have fast and safe access to work resources anytime, anywhere.

**We offer: **

  * More complex application than just a simple CRUD app.
  * Collaborative work culture.
  * Strong feedback, safe-space and caring culture.
  * Talented developers you might learn from and a culture of knowledge sharing between team members. 
  * Flexibility to work remotely and manage your own schedule. We all meet once per sprint in our Brno office at Moravske Namesti. However, some people who prefer to work from office have the freedom to do so.

If you are passionate about Android development, eager to tackle complex challenges, and want to work on projects that make a difference, we encourage you to apply!

### What you can expect to do in this role:

As a developer, you will become a part of a medium size team and get plenty of input and ownership in the design, delivery and release of our software.

In your day-to-day you will:

  * Collaborate with product managers, designers, and other developers to conceptualize and develop our innovative Android application.
  * Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
  * Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
  * Optimize performance and ensure the responsiveness of our application.
  * Mentor and provide guidance to junior developers.

### What we are looking for:

  * Extensive knowledge of Android SDK, Kotlin, and Java.
  * Experience with modern Android architecture components (e.g., MVVM, LiveData, and Coroutines). Plus points for Compose.
  * Proficiency in using RESTful APIs to connect our Android app to back-end services.
  * Networking (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, VPN, understanding of TCP/IP stack in general) is a big plus.
  * Understanding of mobile user interface design and best practices.
  * Familiarity with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
  * Unit/Integration testing and principles of dependency injection.
  * Excellent problem-solving and debugging skills.
  * Strong communication and teamwork abilities.
  * Czech/Slovak language speaking individual.

### Why Jamf?

  * Named a Best Workplace in Technology, 2022.

  * Our developers work in agile delivery teams to produce new features, improve software components, and are the subject matter experts for our Jamf product offerings. 
  * You will have the opportunity to work with a small and empowered team where the culture is based on trust, ownership, and respect.
  * We offer a clear career path that enables you to grow under supportive leadership and management.
  * WFH stipend to better equip your home workspace, Apple gear, and restricted stock units.

 **What does Jamf do?  
** Jamf extends the legendary Apple experience people enjoy in their personal lives to the workplace.

Jamfâ€™s purpose is to simplify work by helping organizations manage and secure an Apple experience that end-users love and organizations trust.

We are free-thinkers, can-doers and problem crushers with a passion for helping customers empower their workforce to focus on their jobs, not the hassles of managing technology â€“ freeing nurses to care, teachers to teach and businesses to thrive. We have over 2,500 employees worldwide who are encouraged to bring their whole selves to work each and every day.
