We're organized into cross-functional development teams assigned to specific verticals.

Our team works with React and Next.js on the frontend. On the backend, we use Elixir and Phoenix. Postgres is our database of choice. GitLab is used as a version control tool and a CI/CD solution; we use Linear as our issue tracker. Our applications are hosted on AWS. We fully rely on our CI for deployments and deploy multiple times per day.

  * A strong team of experienced engineers who will support and facilitate your professional growth.

  * Experience interacting with third-party APIs (analytics, data collection, headless CMS, etc.).
  * Experience dealing with ambiguity, transforming abstract concepts into working software.
  * Strong ability to work independently and be self-guided.
  * Curiosity and a willingness to learn and develop.
