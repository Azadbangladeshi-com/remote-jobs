Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate AI coding assistant, as well as our Code Search product, which helps devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. We‚Äôre building software that builds software, and in doing so we‚Äôre making devs more productive and preparing for a world where a lot more code gets written.

It‚Äôs an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. AI has taken over the world, and we‚Äôve spent the last 10 years building infrastructure that‚Äôs integral to making AI generated code more powerful and accurate. Our customers include 4/5 FAANG companies, 4 of the top 10 banks, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward.

 **Working hours**

  * Proactively propose additions and changes to the team's roadmap, aligning it with the broader goals of Sourcegraph.

**About you**

  * You‚Äôre a software engineer first, but you have a passion for working on the boundaries between software and the underlying infrastructure. You might have some past experience as an SRE, developing tooling for other developers, or jumping between the two.
  * You‚Äôre interested in distributed systems and have experience debugging a few of the challenges that come along with them.
  * You understand the software lifecycle, from design, to coding, to docs, as well as the maintenance lifecycle over time.
  * You don't write code for the sake of it, but to provide value to our customers by solving problems.
  * You value integrity and teamwork. Your strong sense of empathy helps you understand your peers' challenges and you sharply understand how to balance solving current and future problems, carving a path to implement your vision. You‚Äôre able to contribute feedback to your teammates as well as across team boundaries when needed.
  * You understand your role in the company and how you contribute to its success or failures. You have a strong sense of ownership and a healthy sense of urgency. You understand that this is **your** company now.
  * Your sense of ownership extends to the software that you ship to your customers. You understand that your code is likely the first impression many customers have of your company, and you often pause to consider the customer experience during development.
  * You do work you are proud of and your work is respected by your peers as well as the broader community.

Skills

  * You're proficient at writing at least one language and likely experienced in other languages as well.
  * You‚Äôve done some frontend development work at some point in your career.
  * You've had experience working with delivery and build pipelines of various sizes.
  * You have working knowledge of Kubernetes, perhaps even including working and developing with Kubernetes APIs and internals such as CRDs and controllers.
  * **Bonus:** You have worked with Bazel or other build systems in large polyglot codebases.
  * **Bonus:** Familiarity with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS.

It doesn't matter if you're not an expert on all points, what really counts is that you understand the complexities of releasing software, and thrive to make it a seamless experience for both our customers and our teammates. Ultimately, you can jump in at any point in the software lifecycle and understand how to fix issues.
