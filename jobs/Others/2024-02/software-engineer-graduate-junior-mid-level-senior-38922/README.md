The core responsibility is to deliver product features. A major part of this is writing the code that drives our products. But the role of a software engineer is much bigger than just being a coding machine. Software engineers work on the _whole_ development process, including:

  * deciding what features to build
  * driving the design
  * writing the code (of course)
  * pushing testing
  * documenting the feature
  * supporting customers in the field

Along the way, you might:

  * extend and improve the test infrastructure
  * hack on our engineering tools, including p4, django, python, rpm, ...
  * work with sales and business development
  * improve the content on our website 

The Person:

 _If you..._

  * love to program
  * enjoy building things and shipping them, truly making them work
  * find satisfaction in creating a really well-written piece of code
  * care about keeping the code maintainable and preserving its integrity
  * look for a better way, and strive to make it real
  * care about the business too
  * enjoy working with others who feel the same
  * learn how things work, just for fun or out of curiosity

... then this job is for you.
