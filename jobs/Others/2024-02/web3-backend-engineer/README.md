### **About Cata Labs (building Catalyst)**

Cata Labs are contributors to Catalyst, an open-source liquidity protocol for modular blockchains.  

  

Catalyst is the permissionless cross-chain liquidity layer for a future of millions of chains. It enables easy connection between different blockchains, such as Ethereum, Cosmos, and rollups like Optimism and Eclipse.

The goal of Catalyst is to create an interconnected ecosystem where users can effortlessly access assets and applications across multiple chains, and developers can easily launch new blockchains and connect them to existing networks and their respective users.

Catalyst has a vision for a global liquidity layer for all chainsâ€”available automatically at launch. With an innovation called unit of liquidity, Catalyst can automatically connect to any new chain in a future of continued chain proliferation.

  1. Permissionless Liquidity: Catalyst democratises access to blockchains by enabling permissionless liquidity. By allowing any new chain to connect with any desired chains (whether it be an established hub like Ethereum or a newer modular chain), Catalyst reduces overhead in expanding into new chains and accessing their liquidity, thereby providing support for the long tail of assets not found on any other on-chain venue.
  2. Cross-Chain Interoperability: As the number of blockchain networks continues to grow, it's essential to have a solution that enables seamless communication and liquidity movement between them. Catalyst facilitates cross-chain swaps, allowing users to access applications and assets on different chains without being restricted by their current holdings.
  3. Simplified Integration for Developers: Catalyst streamlines the process for developers to create new chains and connect them to existing networks. This encourages innovation and helps developers scale their projects, ultimately leading to a more diverse and robust ecosystem of applications and services for users.
