###  **How do we work together?**

  * Strong empowered & autonomous teams able to make decisions needed to work effectively and self-determine technical & product direction based on facts
  * Taking massive pride, ownership and accountability for all work without being a perfectionist; done is better than perfect
  * People who are multipliers of others; being a team player and great collaborator is better than raw talent.
  * Shared success; we succeed together when our customers are successful, when the team is successful and when the company is successful.
  * Strongly debating your case with facts & data and having the integrity to make a commitment to decisions and move forward owning them as if they were your own
  * Having the humility to make new decisions when we learn more; no decision should be forever, though we should be mindful of the decisions which are easy to change and the ones which are harder to change
  * We optimize for developer experience; machines are less important than people. Our systems & code should reflect that and show empathy to other engineers and ourselves. Simple is better than smart.
  * Frequent and small changes, shipping multiple times per day and developing in the open.
  * Our engineers collaborate very closely, using pair programming, even though we donâ€™t follow it religiously, it is a tool that allows us to streamline feedback loops for code review and make us more effective
  * We have vertical ownership and own our domain segment end-to-end, the APIs, the UI & UX, analytics, deployment, monitoring, and observability. We build it, we run it, we own it _._
  * We support our software by employing a healthy on-call policy
  * Team metrics are important to us though they are not the goal â€“ weâ€™re keeping track of _cycle time, lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore, planned vs unplanned work_ to name a few â€“ understanding this helps to keep us focused on valuable customer outcomes
  * In all work we apply a DevOps mindset and take ownership of testing & QA within the team; we take care in how we write quality software, how we deploy reliable software, and how itâ€™s compliant & secure

### **  
Technology weâ€™re using**

####  **Android**

  * Deep understanding of Android development & best practices 
  * Experience working with patterns such as MVVM

  * Familiarity with other languages such as Ruby, Python, Bash

### **Expectations from you**

  * Our ways of working should resonate with you very strongly and you should feel that you can thrive within that environment and bring value through your work
  * Being open to learning new tools and using the right tool for the job
  * Be familiar with some of the technologies we use already or have comparable experience with alternatives - we donâ€™t expect anyone to know every tool and instead expect adaptability
  * Some experience in professional environments
  * Strong written and verbal communication skills in English
  * Eager to share ideas and learn from others
