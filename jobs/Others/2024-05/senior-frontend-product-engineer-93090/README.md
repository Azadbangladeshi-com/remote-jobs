# [Senior Frontend Product Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-frontend-product-engineer-93090)  
### Productboard  
#### `üåé Prague`  

Join one of our product teams and develop features with real value for a one-of-a-kind product management system used by 4500+ global companies.

As an innovative B2B SaaS company that‚Äôs changing the way product teams around the world build products, we recognize the importance of building a dedicated internal Growth team to further solidify our position on the market. For this reason, we‚Äôre looking for an experienced Frontend Engineer to help lead the charge.

You‚Äôll join a cross-functional team consisting of engineers, a designer, product analyst and product manager to help fuel Productboard‚Äôs growth. Together, you‚Äôll focus on three main areas and challenges:

  * **Guiding new customers.** Our large customers receive all the care they need when purchasing Productboard. This includes a detailed sales process, being provided with solutions architects, and training. For smaller customers, however, such extensive support doesn‚Äôt make economic sense. And that‚Äôs where the Growth team comes in. Together, you‚Äôll help introduce our customers to Productboard, show them how best to use particular features and functions, and help them to fully understand how it‚Äôll make their future work easier.
  * **Setting prices and composing packages or plans.** You‚Äôll revise how different Productboard functionalities are packaged and analyze our pricing models. Currently, basic pricing plans are stripped of certain functionalities. But the trend is towards making pretty much all functionality available to users but with constraints on usability depending on the pricing plan. Users can see the potential of certain features, and if they‚Äôre interested, they can pay more to have them unlocked.
  * **Analyzing and optimizing client acquisition and retention.** We need to track who comes to our site, who drops out at what particular step of the acquisition process and why, and what causes a company to purchase Productboard but leave after a certain period of time. This is very important data that will help us improve the entire customer acquisition and retention process. And that's where the Growth team will help significantly.

It‚Äôs no small task, but for those looking for an exciting and complex tech initiative with a real-world impact, here‚Äôs your chance!

## **On a typical day, you will:**

  * Collaborate with product, data and design to build experiments and assess whether they‚Äôll drive acquisition, retention, and monetization metrics
  * Evaluate other PLG tools on the market, helping us to decide whether there is a more effective way to solve customer and business problems, such as ‚ÄúHow do users get started?‚Äù
  * Evangelize growth engineering topics and lessons learned to the rest of the company
  * Help decide which technical initiatives make it to our roadmap ‚Äî and explain to key stakeholders why we are pursuing certain initiatives or directions over others

### **Our tech stack**

As a Senior Frontend Growth Engineer, you‚Äôll be an expert in TypeScript / React.js.

It‚Äôd also be beneficial to have experience in the following frameworks, tools, and languages:

  * Backend: Ruby (on Rails), GraphQL, Kafka
  * Storage: Postgres, OpenSearch, Redis
  * Data pipeline: Python, Keboola, Looker, Snowflake
  * Infrastructure: AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform

## **About you:**

  * 5+ years of experience building web apps 
    * T-shaped profile with **Backend** depth
    * Experience in solving growth-related problems
  * You work in collaboration with cross-functional business teams (Product, Marketing, Go To Market)
  * You understand the business KPI to be improved (Conversion, Engagement, Adoption, Churn, etc.)
  * You get things done, even outside of your own area of direct responsibilities
  * You're used to hacking in on other teams‚Äô code base (guest dev) and getting their support
  * You optimize for rapid iterations using A/B testing tools (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, etc.) with a rough first shot and clean things up once experimentation (successful or not) is done
  * Telemetry and BI tools to measure the impact of your work are your daily tools (Looker, Amplitude, MixPanel, etc.)
