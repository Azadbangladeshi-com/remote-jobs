 **The Opportunity**

Cint seeks a Cloud Infrastructure (DevOps) Engineer to join our Infrastructure team, reporting to the Infrastructure Engineering Manager.

As a Cloud Infrastructure (DevOps) Engineer at Cint, you will be an efficient problem solver, learn on the fly and make decisions quickly. You will have the opportunity to work with the latest technologies, we always strive to be at the forefront of the latest tech stacks and tools used within our domain.

Your focus in the role would be:

  * Work as part of the Infrastructure team on sprints that evolve our core platform and systems
  * Provide point of expertise on infrastructure and CI/CD to our wider engineering teams - often working as part of their scrum on larger projects
  * Automate the build and deployment of software to our cloud platform and help the organisation do it more efficiently and effectively. Eliminate all repetitive manual operations from our daily lives
  * Improve our monitoring and alerting systems to enable engineering teams to successfully operate and gain insights into the behaviour of applications in ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù environments
  * Participate in an on-call rotation and assist with troubleshooting issues that arise
  * You will be a key person for the development organization by collecting and communicating the overall picture that will enable the teams to achieve better results

With a remote-first mindset, you would join an international team with the possibility to work from our offices around the globe when needed.

**The Team**

The Infrastructure Team‚Äôs mission is to design, build and develop secure and highly available infrastructure, but also to provide a self-service environment that enables software development teams to move fast, stay compliant and take end-to-end responsibility for their products.

Major elements of our platform include AWS (we make significant use of S3, RDS, Kinesis, EC2, EMR, ElastiCache, ElasticSearch and EKS), Linux, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Packer, Ansible and Jenkins. We support applications and services written in Golang, Python, Java, Scala and .Net. We monitor and alert on everything we deploy via Grafana, Prometheus, Graphite and ELK stacks.

The team holds itself accountable to a high standard of build quality. We have recently completed the first major phase of a completely green-field infrastructure and platform rebuild that is designed to underpin Cint‚Äôs business applications for the next decade. We are compulsive about infrastructure as code (nothing in our platform is created or deployed unless via a code change) and driven to achieve a full end to end continuous deployment pipeline.

 **What We Are Looking For**

  * You will be someone that shares our values and ambitions and can bring something to the team that we can benefit from. It might be prior experience of the journey, architectural insight into cloud native systems, specific technology expertise in parts of our stack or a combination of them all. Whatever it is, you will be the kind of person that is energised by complex challenges, teamwork and problem solving.

  * You have good knowledge of monitoring and alerting using one or more of: Graphite, Statsd, Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty
