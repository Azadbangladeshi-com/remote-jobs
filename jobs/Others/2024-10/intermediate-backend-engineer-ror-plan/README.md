# [Intermediate Backend Engineer (RoR), Plan](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/intermediate-backend-engineer-ror-plan)  
### GitLab  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

At GitLab, developers are independent and self-organized individual contributors who work together as a tight team in a remote and agile way.

Most backend developers work on all aspects of GitLab, building features, fixing bugs, and generally improving the application. The Product Planning backend team works on the backend part of GitLab for the Portfolio Management, Design Management, and Certify product categories. Among other things, this means working on GitLab's functionality around Epics, Roadmaps, Requirements, Quality Management, and Service Desk. Our mission is to build planning tools that users love and allow collaboration between all levels of the organization. You can read more about our long-term vision on our direction page.

The Product Planning team collaborates closely with the rest of the Plan stage, and the wider community, to build and improve features that are in high demand by customers. Features such as Epics are widely used internally in the everyday organization of GitLab.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Develop features and improvements to the GitLab product in a secure, well-tested, and performant way
  * Collaborate with Product Management and other stakeholders within Engineering (Frontend, UX, etc.) to maintain a high bar for quality in a fast-paced, iterative environment

  * Conduct Code Review within our Code Review Guidelines and ensure community contributions receive a swift response.
  * Recognize impediments to our efficiency as a team ("technical debt"), propose and implement solutions
  * Represent GitLab and its values in public communication around specific projects and community contributions.
  * Confidently ship small features and improvements with minimal guidance and support from other team members. Collaborate with the team on larger projects.
  * Participate in Tier 2 or Tier 3 weekday and weekend and occasional night on-call rotations to assist troubleshooting product operations, security operations, and urgent engineering issues.
