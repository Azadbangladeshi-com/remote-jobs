### CloudWalk  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,SÃ£o Paulo`  

## Description

 **If you have fallen and risen, if you have broken and fixed, if you have dreamt and built, then you have grit. Then we speak the same language. Welcome to the Wolfpack.**

  

 **About CloudWalk:**

We are one of the fastest growing fintechs on the planet. We kick ass. A unicorn, with millions of happy customers, a hardcore team, and hundreds of millions in funding and revenue. But not your typical startup.

We build and learn, fast, and we want the hackers, the artists, the crafters - join the Wolfpack!

  

As a member of the engineering team, you are expected to have a high bar for the quality of code and the quality of user experience. Due to the nature of our business, candidates with the ability to handle multiple projects with changing priorities will thrive at CloudWalk.

### What You'll Be Doing:

* You will be responsible for developing backend applications using your knowledge of architecture, monitoring, and product. 
* Additionally, you will be responsible for developing and maintaining automated test suites and debugging production issues.
* You will create the best solutions on the market and also mentor junior developers.
* Finally, you will need to work closely with other developers, business stakeholders, and product owners to ensure successful product delivery.

  

### What You Need To Succeed:

* Minimum of 08 years of professional hands-on experience;
* Demonstrable experience leading engineers;
* Strong systems architecture and coding/scripting skills;
* Experience proactively collaborating across different engineering teams;
* Experience working with service-oriented architectures and complicated systems at scale;
* Comfortable with ambiguity; you enjoy figuring out what needs to be done;
* Ability to quickly understand technical and business requirements, translating them into technical design and implementation;
* Advanced English communication skills, primarily for internal communication with our diverse, multinational team.

  

We are not expecting candidates to have expertise across all of these areas. We will gladly help you bridge the gaps.

As a member of a fully remote and distributed team, you are expected to complete tasks autonomously, being highly collaborative and self-driven.

  

 **Diversity and Inclusion**

We believe in social inclusion, respect, and appreciation of all people. We promote a welcoming work environment, where each CloudWalker can be authentic, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion, sexuality, mobility, disability, or education.
