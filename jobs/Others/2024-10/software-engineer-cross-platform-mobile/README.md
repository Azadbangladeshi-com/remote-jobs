## Description

At Spruce, our mission is to let users control their data across the web. Instead of people signing into platforms, platforms should sign into people's data vaults, such as digital wallets that hold credentials.

  

There are no well-worn paths or theoreticals here. Every Spruce technical staffer gets their hands dirty writing code, learning new technologies, and solving problems at the bleeding edge of our space. We hire results-oriented developers who love technology and are committed to intellectual honesty, user privacy, and innovation.

  

The ideal candidate for this mobile engineering role will have experience developing Android and iOS apps through their full lifecycle, from concept through shipping to maintenance. You will work on a privacy-first digital identity wallet, controlled by the end user. We use a combination of core libraries that we also maintain, low level protocols, and new interoperable digital credential standards. Most important, you interested in challenging opportunities for significant personal growth.
