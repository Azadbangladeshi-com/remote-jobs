### Responsibilities

* Train, improve, evaluate, integrate and deploy machine learning models for a variety of computer vision use cases such as: feature detection/matching, place recognition, structure from motion, depth estimation and completion, mesh reconstruction, point cloud filtering, NeRFs, gaussian splats.
* Optimize the performance of ML systems for speed, accuracy, and efficiency. 
* Take ownership of deliverables from design, implementation, release, and support as a self-driven engineer. Be willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done.
* Stay up-to-date with the latest 3D ML and vision advancements and evaluate their potential application to our workflows.

  

  

### Requirements

* Bachelorâ€™s or Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field with 5+ years of professional experience in 3D Machine Learning and Computer Vision
* Experience designing, building, integrating, deploying, debugging and maintaining large-scale production 3D computer vision systems.
* Ability to timebox experiments, iterate effectively and leverage excellent problem-solving skills to triage routes to success.
* Experience training and improving models for feature detection/matching, depth estimation or mesh reconstruction
* Experience with modern ML in Pytorch, Keras, TensorFlow or equivalent
* Experience building and improving models like Mask2former, MaskRCNN, Resnet, Unet
* Experience with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub CI) 
* Experience as effective remote employee able to overlap standup AM meetings PST
* Strong communication and leadership skills.

  

### Preferred Qualifications & Expertise

* Proficiency in developing and debugging C++
