#### `ðŸ’° CAD $120,275~$155,650` `ðŸŒŽ Canada - Remote`  

**About the role:**

Samsara is hiring a frontend-leaning full stack developer for the Web Platform team. The charter of the team is to accelerate feature development within Samsaraâ€™s web product by maintaining a high-quality frontend developer experience, owning common frameworks, shepherding/up-leveling our Design System, ensuring overall frontend health, and building a small set of features that cross-team boundaries.

Our team is currently staffed with several senior engineers along with one staff engineer. There are plenty of experienced folks to learn from. Weâ€™re looking for an experienced full-stack engineer who has a strong interest in front-end development to come join us!

**This is a remote position open to candidates based in Canada.**

**You should apply if:**

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** The software, firmware, and hardware you build will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  * **You want to build for scale:** With over 2.3 million IoT devices deployed to our global customers, you will work on a range of new and mature technologies driving scalable innovation for customers across industries driving the world's physical operations.
  * **You are a life-long learner:** We have ambitious goals. Every Samsarian has a growth mindset as we work with a wide range of technologies, challenges, and customers that push us to learn on the go.
  * **You believe customers are more than a number:** Samsara engineers enjoy a rare closeness to the end user and you will have the opportunity to participate in customer interviews, collaborate with customer success and product managers, and use metrics to ensure our work is translating into better customer outcomes.
  * **You are a team player:** Working on our Samsara Engineering teams requires a mix of independent effort and collaboration. Motivated by our mission, weâ€™re all racing toward our connected operations vision, and we intend to winâ€”together.

**In this role, you will:**

  * Solve complex problems and own the success of your solutions as you architect, build, test, and deliver full-stack products
  * Communicate, collaborate, and develop with engineers, other platform teams, product teams, product managers, designers, and support teams
  * Build upon skills and knowledge across a range of technologies such as Go, GraphQL, Typescript, React, and MySQL. Due to the nature of the role, previous experience with React is required, but experience with the other technologies is not required
  * Own the operational health of production systems as we build for the future scale of an ever-growing customer base
  * Make an impact on our core architecture, roadmap, and the wider engineering community
  * Champion, role model, and embed Samsaraâ€™s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices

**Minimum requirements for the role:**

  * You have at least a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar, or corresponding level of relevant education
  * You have 4+ years of experience working professionally with modern development practices
  * You have knowledge of designing, architecting, and developing applications using JavaScript/Typescript and React
  * Experience working with Designers, PMs, and other developers to ship E2E features to production environments
  * You can translate Design Specs into code, you can act as an interface between Design and Engineering, and you can balance the priorities of Design and Engineering
  * At this time we are only looking for candidates in Canada

**An ideal candidate also has:**

  * Experience with design systems
  * Experience with web accessibility
  * Experience using GraphQL
  * Experience with CICD pipelines
