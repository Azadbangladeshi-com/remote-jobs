We own 3 major systems for the company: the Configuration platform which allows members to have the UX exactly as the customer wants on all our products. The Data ingestion and processing pipeline for any 3rd party data our company uses. And lastly, Reporting and dashboard products to deliver insights to our customers.

You will help our company become an indispensable partner to our customers.
