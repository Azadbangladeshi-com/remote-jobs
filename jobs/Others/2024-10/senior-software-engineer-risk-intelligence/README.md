Ancient Roman roads, extending over 250,000 miles, were crucial for the swift movement of armies and trade, helping to unify and control the vast empire. Their advanced design ensured efficient resource distribution and communication. Similarly, modern data engineering provides the infrastructure for today's digital landscape, creating seamless data pipelines and storage systems.

Mercury has a quickly growing digital footprint, with a variety of teams, problems, and information that needs connecting. Just as Roman roads connected and empowered the region, the Risk Intelligence team works to connect diverse technical teams, enabling informed decisions and driving success across the fraud, risk, and compliance spaces.

In this position you will lead the design and development of sophisticated data systems tailored to ensure regulatory compliance and detect potential fraud on the platform. As an engineer experienced in modern data architecture you will help mentor and teach the team best practices for technical design. You will help us understand data technologies, both new and mature, and how to wield them properly.
