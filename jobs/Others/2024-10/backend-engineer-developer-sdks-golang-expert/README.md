## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

Our team owns open-source SDKs that reflect the Stripe API in seven different programming languages. A _vast_ majority of server-side Stripe integrations are built using our open-source SDKs. Our team also owns an in-house code generation framework which is used to generate not just the SDKs, but the code snippets in our documentation and the commands in Stripe Shell which is an in-browser version of the Stripe CLI.

We are dedicated to providing a world class experience for developers using our SDKs.. We influence how APIs are authored at Stripe so that they get represented in a user friendly way in SDKs and documentation. We want to collaborate with and help our friends in the Stripe community who build and maintain SDKs in programming languages that we do not support.

## **What youâ€™ll do**

In this role, youâ€™ll have an opportunity to shape the experience of developers using Stripe SDKs that power over 80% of the payment volume at Stripe.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Be the Golang expert in the team representing the needs of the Golang community and ensuring we build experiences that are idiomatic
  * Use your Node.js expertise to improve our code generation framework and work towards a future where we open source it to make it easier for 3rd party Stripe SDK owners to maintain their libraries
  * Collaborate with various Stripe teams to release their APIs in the SDKs and improve the efficiency of the release process
  * Help streamline the API authoring process at Stripe
  * Support our users reaching out to us on the open source GitHub repositories for our SDKs
  * Add support for new language features in SDKs
  * Help lead Stripe's API design process, providing guidance to product teams as they seek to produce powerful and intuitive abstractions that are surfaced through our SDKs
  * Influence the teamâ€™s strategy and roadmap through feedback-driven proposals, and direct engagement with our developer community on GitHub and other channels

## **Who you are**

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * 5+ years of experience as a software engineer
  * 2+ years experience in Golang
  * 1+ years experience in Node.js
  * An interest in working with multiple programming languages

### **Preferred qualifications**
