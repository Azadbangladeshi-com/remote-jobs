### Aledade  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Austin, TX`  

## Description

As a Senior Software Engineer II at Aledade, we maintain, improve, and expand our web application and data pipelines. We're looking for engineers who know that writing new code is not always the solution to a problem, but when technological changes are needed they create secure, maintainable, performant, correct, scalable, and stable solutions to the complex and unique challenges in our corner of the healthcare industry.

They embrace strategies that minimize risk, leaning towards observability, alerting, metrics, high test coverage, and frequent releases that incrementally build value.
