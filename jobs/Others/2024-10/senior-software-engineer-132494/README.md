## Description

Company Description

Swiftly is on a mission to help cities move more efficiently. We are the leading transit data platform for agencies to share real-time passenger information, manage day-to-day operations, and improve service performance. Today, over 180 transit agencies in 11 countries â€“ including LA Metro, MARTA, SEPTA, and MBTA â€“ rely on Swiftly to improve on-time performance by up to 40% and increase passenger information accuracy by up to 50%. The result is better service reliability, increased ridership, and more efficient transit operations.

  

 **Engineering at Swiftly**

Engineering at Swiftly is not only about writing code â€“ we believe in creating empowered product teams that work together to conceptualize new features and bring them to life. Each team aims to strike a balance between delivering incremental improvements, creating prototypes to test new ideas and mitigate risks, and building scalable software using industry best practices. Weâ€™re guided by a mission to positively impact transit riders, and we embrace humility and intentionality in how we make technical decisions so that we best meet our customersâ€™ needs.

  

 _Even though Swiftly's HQ office is located in San Francisco, CA, we are open to candidates in most locations across the U.S. as well as Ontario and British Columbia, Canada, who are open to traveling at least once a quarter. At this time, we are unable to provide Visa sponsorship._

  

 **About the Role**

This person will join a cross-functional product team focused on many of the nuts and bolts that make all of Swiftlyâ€™s products work: ingesting voluminous and diverse real-time data from thousands of transit vehicles, connecting Swiftly with onboard IoT hardware devices, helping users manage their Swiftly deployment, and ultimately helping transit agencies keep data flowing through their fleet and out to their riders.

This is a full-stack team responsible for hardware device integrations, real-time data processing, cloud-based software and APIs, and client-side SaaS web applications to manage our product and visualize data. Individual responsibilities will vary over time based on your skills, needs, and collective prioritization of the team, but the opportunity is to work on various systems that will make a tangible impact on public transportation agencies, transit riders, and Swiftly as a company.

Experience with data systems and processing on the backend makes you a good fit for this role, along with designing and building cloud-based Java backend services and APIs. Additionally, as this is a full-stack team, experience collaborating with peers to deliver end-to-end experiences across frontend and backend is desired. In general, weâ€™d love to see candidates apply who enjoy product development as a means to enable you to solve problems end-to-end with your teammates.

We encourage you to apply if the above is exciting to you and if you meet **half or more** of the below requirements. Above all else, we value candidates who angle toward growth, leveraging a positive attitude and the aptitude to relentlessly seek and solve problems to deliver impact. We know the tech landscape is ever-changing and strongly support individual growth. If this is exciting to you, then we'd love to talk!
