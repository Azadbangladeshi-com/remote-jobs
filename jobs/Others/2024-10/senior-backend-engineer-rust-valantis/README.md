**Vision**

Valantis opens the design space of exchanges beyond what is possible in any other framework. Our mission is to keep onchain liquidity as competitive and accessible as possible using the Valantis Protocol as our foundation. Valantis Labs aims to preserve the founding properties of DeFi amongst ongoing paradigm shifts.

**Why does that matter?**

It is not easy to build or launch a DEX. Beyond the redundancy and security risks of writing smart contract protocols, bootstrapping adoption for a DEX is historically difficult, not purely dependent on merit or efficiency, and overall costly. We want to commoditize the DEX stack to a point where merit and efficiency are the main drivers for liquidity and order flow. This entails:

  * Lowering the developer entry cost to introduce new DEX designs.

  * Commoditize order flow through Valantis-specific collaborative Solvers and Solver network integrations making Valantis pools maximally discoverable.

  * Innovative DEX designs accommodating a changing order flow and liquidity provision landscape.

  * Creating secure end-user products that offer attractive financial strategies without complexity, built on top of the Valantis Protocol.

  * Building off chain infrastructure that extends the properties of onchain finance.

At Valantis Labs, we believe the future landscape of onchain order flow will be defined by applications. We are seeking a mid to senior-level Backend Engineer to join our innovative team and lead our backend development efforts. We seek someone who has experience building scalable DeFi or MEV trading systems in Rust, and ideally has led teams in this context.

**Key Responsibilities:**

  * Design and develop high-performance API infrastructure and Solver-related scripts/modules that interface with Valantis pools.

  * Build and maintain off-chain SDKs and infrastructure that enable user-facing interactions with Valantis Pools and respective Modules. Each Module can be a fully-fledged Decentralized Exchange design.

  * Collaborate on external partner integrations, including integrating with new Solver networks and front-ends to make all Valantis pools discoverable for swaps, and Market Makers that leverage HOT AMM and other Valantis Modules to run advanced liquidity provision strategies.

**Ideal Candidate Profile:**

  * 3-5+ years of experience in backend development, with a strong focus on building scalable and performant systems in Rust.

  * Proven experience in DeFi, running MEV strategies in production or related blockchain projects.

  * Strong understanding of API design and distributed systems.

  * Reasonable understanding of DevOps: enough to do backend deployments on the cloud by yourself.

  * Excitement about understanding the unique architecture of the Valantis Protocol and tackling the most impactful problems to enable DeFi to compete with its centralized counterparts.

  * Compatibility with US and EU time zones.

**What we look for:**

  * A versatile engineer comfortable working across multiple domains, from cloud infrastructure to blockchain development.

  * Self-motivated individual capable of autonomously solving complex challenges.

  * Comfortable implementing novel products with evolving requirements.

  * Strong communicator who values clear and frequent team interactions.

  * Commitment to upholding best practices in engineering, security and system design through documentation and respect for processes.

  * Passion for DeFi and a desire to contribute to the future of onchain liquidity and order flow.

**What We Offer:**

  * Opportunity to work on cutting-edge DeFi technology that is reshaping the onchain economy.

  * Collaborative remote work environment with team members across multiple time zones with opportunities to work in person at will.

  * Competitive compensation and the chance to be part of a funded, ambitious startup.

If you are excited about pushing the boundaries of DeFi and have a track record of building high performance backend systems, we want to hear from you.
