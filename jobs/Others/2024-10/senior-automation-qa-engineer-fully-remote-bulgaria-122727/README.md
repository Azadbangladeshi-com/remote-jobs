## Description

 **About Us:**

  

Consensus is a top place to work due to the incredible culture our employees have created. We strive to provide an opportunity to work with a great team with a compelling product with the objective that adding value in your work life fuels the rest of your life. We know that a winning company is built on the efforts of its people, and that‚Äôs an environment we foster at Consensus. We encourage every employee to bring their authentic self to work and take ownership of their position and their career. We strive to give our employees everything they need to make meaningful contributions to the overall success of our company. We‚Äôre looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!

  

We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?

  

We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.

  

This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team‚Äôs productivity, it also removes the "demo lag time" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.

  

**Our Values:**

  

Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a ‚Äúversion one‚Äù. Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a ‚Äúno peacemongering‚Äù principle. We know our path to success is hard and we don‚Äôt hesitate to ask hard things of others. We are respectfully confrontational to one another and ask direct accountability questions.

 **About the role:**

  

If you are a top-notch senior automation engineer that loves solving tough technical problems while working with passionate, driven people, then this position might be a good fit for you. This position will be responsible for helping Consensus keep high quality standards, through automation and testing, while we meet aggressive scale and platform growth.
