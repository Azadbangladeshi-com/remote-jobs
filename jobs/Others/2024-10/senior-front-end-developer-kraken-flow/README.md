We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

  

Kraken Technologies is a company within Octopus Energy Group who are licensing the Kraken platform and operating model to clients across the world. Current clients are both the Octopus Energy retails businesses around the world as well as external clients such as Good Energy, Origin, EDF, E.ON & Queensland Energy - with many more expected to join over the next few years!

  

 **Our team**

While Kraken Technologies is written and maintained by a 800+ people strong, multi-discipline engineering team, youâ€™ll be part of a new, early stage product division within: KrakenFlow.

  

KrakenFlow is a young team, <20 people in size, and responsible for the development of an end-to-end business process management platform. The new web-based tool allows internal teams and clients to configure, execute, and track their business processes, with a drag-n-drop workflow builder at its core. This is a unique opportunity to marry early-stage challenges with the benefits of the highly successful scale-up that is Kraken.

  

We work agile and use tools like Notion, Asana, and Figma to specify & plan our work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; Sentry and CloudWatch to measure performance and monitor production.Some of our coding conventions are open-source. Kraken is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.

  

 **Our technology**

For the KrakenFlow web app, client-side we use NextJS (React), TypeScript, Zustand, and React Query to connect to our OpenAPI internal REST API, which is fully typed incl. code-gen for type generation.

Server-side, we mainly use Python & Django.

We use AWS heavily, employing most of the "Hashistack" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline.

  

 **What you'll do**

Youâ€™ll be a core contributor to the KrakenFlow workflow management experience, delighting users with powerful features around our drag-n-drop workflow builder, form builder, as well as management & analytics pages that are part of the user-facing platform.

  

Youâ€™ll love this role if youâ€™re excited about coding a lot, in close collaboration with your highly experienced peers as part of a truly global team. Youâ€™ll ensure clean software design, choice of right technologies, and participate in building an application to very high standards that is designed for tremendous global impact.

  

As the team will grow, youâ€™ll onboard other team members, ensure good documentation, clean code and contribute to establishing a great developer experience.

  

You'll be working for a company thatâ€™s fighting climate change.

  

  

As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the energy market towards a lower carbon future.

  

 **What you'll have**

We're looking for someone with a passion for software engineering and problem-solving; a diligent and thoughtful collaborator, with an eagerness to build outstanding software.
