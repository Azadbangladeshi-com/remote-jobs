### Metabase  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Global Remote`  

## Description

Metabase is the easiest way for people to get insights from their data, from tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens of thousands of users. That's why people love us.

  

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure, analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

Tens of thousands of companies use Metabase every day to answer questions about their data. While we seek to become the de-facto self-managed open source analytics software for organizations everywhere, many customers want an ability to use Metabase without worrying about the operational details of self-hosting. Thatâ€™s why we recently launched our Metabase Cloud product. Weâ€™re looking for operations engineers to help build out and run our new and quickly growing â€˜Metabase Cloudâ€™ hosted product.

We're a global team (50% outside the US), fully distributed (from Thailand to California), who get things done asynchronously, with plenty of uninterrupted time, supporting each other to do the best work of our careers. We offer flexibility (define your own schedule and work from wherever you want), autonomy, and an environment that fosters growth, learning, and development. We're relentlessly user-focused and believe in building long-term value, not short-term hacks. And we raised a $30M Series B to take our approach to the next level for years to come.
