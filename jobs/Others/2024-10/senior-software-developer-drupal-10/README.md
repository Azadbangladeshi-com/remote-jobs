  * Find passion in new challenges. Every chance to learn and move things forward with your can-do attitude or to share your entrepreneurship excites you.
  * Thoroughly enjoy collaborative work. Knowledge sharing and the chance to be part of a team who co-own the output, instead of a solo hero who lives and dies by their work alone, is important to you.

  * Enjoy a flexible schedule of full-time hours. As a remote-first organization, we care about the work you do, but it‚Äôs up to you to choose where and how you do it. 
  * Explore ongoing opportunities for professional development: training, conferences, certifications, and in-house peer mentorship. 
  * Experiment with new techniques, wear multiple hats and learn about new disciplines. 
  * Pursue independent projects, explore new ideas, and challenge yourself in your field with dedicated ‚ÄúAwesome time‚Äù (self-directed professional development) annually and quarterly training budgets. 
  * On top of standard medical and dental coverage, we offer benefits like a parental leave top-up plan, an EAP, mental health coverage, virtual healthcare and a minimum vacation policy. 
  * Our Toronto HQ is a modern, ergonomic space complete with hotelling standing/sitting desks available and an open-concept social atmosphere.

  * The Canada Base Salary Range for this role is $110,000 - $130,000 CAD. This pay range is dependent on your experience and is not inclusive of any benefits or equity that might exist in your total compensation package.

**Performance and Growth Expectations**

We emphasize accountability for outcomes, but autonomy in activities. Your work will be measured across a number of data points (peer, leader & project team feedback) and will also be measured on the basis of client and user satisfaction. Your growth path is in your hands‚Äî you‚Äôll have ongoing meetings with your leader to help determine your path, but your progress will be based on what you hope to achieve and how you choose to access the resources available to you.
