### CloudWalk  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,SÃ£o Paulo`  

## Description

Have you dived deep into the world of databases and now feel it's too late to throw all the effort, despair, and gnashing of teeth away to go try and sell your trinkets on the beach? Have you given up any other worldly pleasures to spend hours reading documentation?

  

We know working with databases can be soul-sucking. If you, just like us, have given up on everything, we have an opportunity for you!

If you like a chaotic environment and dislike bureaucracy, enjoy working on unconventional projects, Cloudwalk is the right place for you. Being exceptional is at the core of Cloudwalk. Here, we make things happen in the most die-hard way possible.

  

At Cloudwalk, we have over 70 database instances, distributed throughout various teams and products, which makes management a hellish challenge. Until AI finally replaces everyone, or the long-awaited and much-desired meteor hits our planet, we will need someone to take on the drudgeries of DBRE with us.
