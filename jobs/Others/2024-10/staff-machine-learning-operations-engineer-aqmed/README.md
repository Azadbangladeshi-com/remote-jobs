### SandboxAQ  
#### `üåé Remote, USA`  

**About the Role:**

Sandbox AQ operates at the intersection of AI/ML and quantum, and you will provide the AI/ML and computational infrastructure backbone to enable a new generation of health technologies. This includes the strategic architecting of data, computing, and ML infrastructure from prototype to production, as well as working with the research and product engineering teams to ensure that Sandbox SaaS products are always pushing the state of the art. You will bring MLOps expertise to bear in making important architectural design decisions to ensure the resultant pipelines are scalable, robust, fault-tolerant, secure, and maintainable. With your experience, you will provide guidance for AI/ML research scientists in following best practices around software engineering in order to facilitate production level code and an easier path to deployment.

**What You‚Äôll Do:**

**Technical Leadership**

  *     * Make clear, well-researched, and experience-based architectural recommendations, which support the delivery of complex AI SAAS products to customers. 
    * Analyze and communicate the critical trade-offs in competing architectural options, by articulating the impact on the product quality and scalability, technical complexity, timeline for delivery, and ongoing maintenance requirements.
    * Guide the AI/DS team toward continual improvement in fundamental engineering best practices.

**Technical Implementation**

  *     * Build complex yet robust MLOps pipelines to support the delivery of AI SAAS products.
    * Provide experienced recommendations for the best AWS services to utilize for optimal MLOps pipeline delivery. 
    * Implement systems to train existing Dl and ML models at scale, and iterate rapidly toward new AI/ML products.
    * Implement tools and methodologies that support solid data governance, including monitoring of traceability, data quality, data security, etcetera. 
    * Conduct code reviews for more junior AI/ML scientists

**About You:**

  * You understand Deep Learning and Machine Learning well enough to help deploy, maintain, and monitor models in production environments.
  * You have 7+ years of experience in AWS, MLOps, and AI/ML, which allows you to make skillful recommendations about which services would be best to use for a given AI Product.
  * You thrive in a startup environment and are able to balance the need for speed with the desire to build solid, reliable software.

**You know how to listen and communicate respectfully with key stakeholders to understand their requirements and collaboratively work through any mutual concerns, before finalizing an architectural decision.**

  * You are a ‚Äúdoer‚Äù with communication skills; you know how to ask the right questions and how to talk to the key stakeholders, but once the product goals are clear, you implement rapidly and skillfully.
  * You love to learn about the latest evolutions in AI/ML, and you get a deep intrinsic reward from finally deploying these cutting-edge AI/ML models and monitoring their impact.
