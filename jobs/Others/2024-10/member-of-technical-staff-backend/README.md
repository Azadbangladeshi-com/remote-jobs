### **About the role**

Weâ€™re looking for a Software Engineer for our Backend team to help us build cutting-edge, AI-powered video creation and collaboration tools. Rather than specialists, weâ€™re seeking curiosity-driven engineers who are determined problem solvers and thrive in fast-paced, high-ownership environments. Our engineering team is highly collaborative and works on a wide variety of exciting challenges, including building backend services for interactive video processing and streaming, and deploying cutting-edge computer vision and generative models to production.

### A peek at our technical stack

Our video streaming backend components are written in **Python** , use a lot of **FFmpeg/libav and HLS** for on-the-fly transcoding, **PyTorch and TorchScript** for ML inference, and are deployed as containerized services on **Kubernetes**. Our API endpoints for real-time collaboration and media asset management are written in **Typescript** and **N** **ode.js** and are deployed as serverless functions on **AWS Lambda**.

### What youâ€™ll do

  * Work with a world-class engineering team pushing the boundaries of creativity and content creation on the browser
  * Work across the Backend stack to implement new product features for Runwayâ€™s machine learning based video creation and collaboration tools
  * Create server-side components using the latest in machine learning and graphics
  * Improve the performance, reliability, and code quality of our codebases

### What youâ€™ll need

  * 3+ years of industry experience in a software engineering role, ideally backend focused
  * Demonstrated fluency of one or more programming languages, including Python, Node.js, or Rust
  * Experience in architecting production-ready systems and familiarity with debugging and profiling tools
  * Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines
  * Humility and open mindedness; at Runway we love to learn from one another
