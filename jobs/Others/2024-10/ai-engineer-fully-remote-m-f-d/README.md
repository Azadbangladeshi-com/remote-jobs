  * Stay up to date with the latest advancements in the AI market, evaluating and selecting emerging models, technologies, and approaches for each use case, considering factors such as performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.
  * Assist teams in continuously improving the performance and reliability of released AI-powered features through iterative development and testing.

### Your Equipment

  * Verifiable ands-on experience in applying AI models and tools, whether for personal experimentation or solving real-world problems, and the ability to find and exploit capabilities of models through hands-on experience.
  * Familiarity with popular AI frameworks and libraries, such as Hugging Face, LangChain, Llamaindex, and LMStudio.
  * Proficiency in Python or JavaScript, and an understanding of the growing importance of human-written code in orchestrating and supplanting LLM power.
  * First experience with retrieval augmented generation solutions and or multi-agent solutions.
  * Understanding of the importance of systematic and automated evaluation efforts.
  * Understanding of fundamental software engineering best practices, including version control, testing, and deployment.
  * Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think creatively.
  * Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively in a cross-functional team.
  * Curiosity and a genuine passion for AI and a strong interest in its potential applications.

Bonus points for this role:

  * If you have any experience with fine-tuning or working with production-ready GraphRAG solutions, that's a plus!
  * Familiarity with productionizing AI models and integrating them into user-facing applications is a nice-to-have.
  * While not required, exposure to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure, and their AI services, can be beneficial.
  * If you have any contributions to open-source AI projects or a portfolio of personal AI projects on GitHub, we'd love to see them!

Whether you are an experienced professional or a motivated starter, if you are passionate about harnessing the power of AI to build groundbreaking products and have some hands-on experience in software engineering, we would love to hear from you. Join our team and help us push the boundaries of what's possible with AI!
