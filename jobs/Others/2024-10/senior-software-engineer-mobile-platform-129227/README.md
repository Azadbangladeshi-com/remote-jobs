**About the role:**

**â€‹â€‹** The Mobile Platform team owns the frameworks and tooling that enable other developers at Samsara to build and deploy mobile applications for our customers.

Our team builds and maintains a variety of infrastructure including reusable UX components and design systems, SDKs, continuous integration systems, monitoring tools, and networking and persistence layer frameworks. The systems we own are leveraged across multiple applications and business units and impact teams across the company.
