## Description

 _Your career is an investment that grows over time!_

  

Wealthsimple is on a mission to help everyone achieve financial freedom by reimagining what it means to manage your money. Using smart technology, we take financial services that are often confusing, opaque and expensive and make them transparent and low-cost for everyone. Weâ€™re the largest fintech company in Canada, with over 4 million users who trust us with more than $50 billion in assets.

  

Our teams ship often and make an impact with groundbreaking ideas. We're looking for talented people who keep it simple and value collaboration and humility as we continue to create inclusive and high-performing teams where people can be inspired to do their best work.

  

 **About the Platform Engineering Team**

  

We aim to design, build and provide scalable, secure, and stable infrastructure, while also enabling our engineers to quickly and easily deploy new code. The Wealthsimple ecosystem is primarily Ruby on Rails and JavaScript micro services, with state backend by Aurora (PostgreSQL) and Redis. The infrastructure-specific stack you will work on is powered by AWS, powered by Docker and Consul and finally, orchestrated by Nomad and "coming soon" Kubernetes.

  

The data-delivery team is a part of the Platform Engineering team in Wealthsimple and is mainly responsible for:

1\. Designing, administering and maintaining the data stores for Wealthsimple including the data replication processes

2\. Administering Oracle EBS

3\. Developing ETL pipelines, integrations and data validation reconciliation tools

  

We are seeking talented software engineers who are excited to shape out Wealthsimple's data engineering foundation. We understand each software engineer working in data has a unique blend of skills. So whether your strength is in data platform or data modelling or stream processing, we'd love to have a chat with you!
