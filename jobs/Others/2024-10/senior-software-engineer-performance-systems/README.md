### Gather  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

**Role overview:**

A fast, performant application is crucial to the foundations that power Gather. Our product is rich and complex, encompassing a full audio/video system powered by WebRTC, a real-time virtual world similar to an MMORPG, and a full React-based web application with chat, calendar integrations, and more.

In this role, youâ€™ll plan and build the systems that help us tackle performance issues at Gather. Youâ€™ll investigate and solve performance issues across our entire stack, including our desktop application, GPU-bound features, browser javascript engines, memory management, and more. Youâ€™ll be tasked with building a systematic approach to identifying performance bottlenecks, including standing up benchmarking suites to understand whether our application is meeting our high-quality bar.

**Where you will make an impact:**

  * Build a framework to run reproducible performance tests on diverse hardware configurations
  * Design and implement performance benchmarks that cover the full stack, including GPU, front-end, and server-side workloads
  * Investigate performance issues and deep-dive into technical debugging across web applications, desktop applications, and our audio-video stack.
  * Collaborate with engineers across teams to design, develop, test, and optimize software for better performance
  * Leverage browser and operating system debugging tools to gather performance traces and identify areas for improvement
  * Conduct performance experiments designed to validate improvements in key metrics (e.g., P95/P99 latency, query performance, CPU/memory utilization)
  * Foster a culture of early-stage performance testing and awareness throughout the development life cycle
  * Drive long-term front-end infrastructure vision and strategy, influencing product teams to deliver a best-in-class product when it comes to performance

**What you bring:**

  * 2+ years of experience with performance profiling and analysis, debugging, and optimization across a range of systems (frontend, backend, desktop, or GPU-bound)
  * 2+ years of experience designing and executing reproducible performance experiments, with a strong understanding of key performance metrics
  * 4+ years of experience with TypeScript, with experience in C++ or Rust being a plus
  * Excellent data analysis skills with the ability to interpret performance metrics and present them to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
  * Ability to solve complex performance issues and decompose large problems into smaller, testable hypotheses
  * Intrinsic motivation and the drive to own and solve complex problems without guidance
  * A strong desire to build the best experience for customers
  * Excellent interpersonal and communication skills, with technical leadership abilities
  * An open and growth mindset when giving and receiving feedback
  * Resourcefulness, a bias toward action, and a love moving fast
  * A healthy tolerance for the chaotic balance between Doing Things Right and iterating and shipping quickly

**US Salary Range**

At Gather, compensation may vary outside of this range depending on a number of factors, including a candidateâ€™s qualifications, skills, competencies and experience, and location. The base salary range for this position in the selected city is **$160,650 - $203,175** annually and we encourage candidates outside of this salary range to apply.

Base pay is one part of the total package provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work, and this role will be eligible for a stock reward reflective of an early-stage startup.

  * Competitive compensation, benefits, and meaningful equity
  * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees and their dependents
  * 401k and matching program
