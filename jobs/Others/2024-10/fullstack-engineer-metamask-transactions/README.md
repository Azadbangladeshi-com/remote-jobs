**About MetaMask**

We‚Äôre building for a future where the internet and world economy empowers people through interactions based on consent, privacy, and free association. Where both communities and individuals flourish. To accomplish that, we‚Äôre working hard to make web3 accessible for everyone around the world.  
MetaMask is both a crypto wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web. Our tools help people create communities, play video games, access financial services, make payments, invest in assets, protect against economic turmoil, and more. Our browser extension and mobile platforms meet the needs of millions of users and developers across the world.  
Originally a humble key manager, today MetaMask serves over 30 million monthly active users as a decentralized application development platform, an aggregator of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and a decentralized identity manager.

We are looking for a senior fullstack engineer with production application experience to work on bringing transactions through the web3 ecosystem. This will include work related to the transaction supply chain and how we can facilitate a more frictionless user experience. Many of the activities we focus on are adjacent to ethereum and require an understanding of the EVM. We handle smart transactions: simulations, ordering and routing, as well as new ways to spend gas. They all require an understanding and appreciation of the ethereum ecosystem, from dApps to DEXs and wallets to nodes.  
We are looking for someone with a deep experience building web and mobile products. You will be responsible for developing new features and enhancing existing ones, aiming to deliver releases of the highest quality. Concurrently, you'll engage in research to conceive innovative features. While most of the work will be on the front-ends, some features will require you to work on the back-end.

While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.
