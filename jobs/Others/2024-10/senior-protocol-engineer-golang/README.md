### Serotonin  
#### `üåé remote,New York`  

## Description

Our clients mission is to commoditize all forms of intelligence. Operating at the intelligence layer of the AI stack, they believe that building at the intersection of crypto and AI is the optimal path to achieving their mission.

  

As crypto-natives and ML experts with experience across leading Web3 projects, large finance companies, and large tech companies, the team combines deep blockchain knowledge with world-class technical capabilities. Backed by top crypto venture funds and angel investors who share the vision for the future of digital ownership.

  

We are looking for a protocol engineer to join the growing team responsible for both the design and development of upgrades to the chain that improve upon its incentive mechanisms, optimize its capital and computational efficiencies, and generalize its application. You will join a flat, collaborative environment that emphasizes solving hard problems well and with haste.

### Key Responsibilities:

* Designing improvements and new features: improving upon its incentive mechanisms, optimizing the capital and computational efficiencies, and generalizing its application.
* Writing Go code that improves the codebase by implementing ideas designed as above
* Preemptively assess all implications from every new decision made for the chain and every signal emitted by the chain. This includes but is not limited to economic, scalability, and usability concerns; anything that comprises an ‚Äúend-to-end ownership‚Äù of the chain.
* Battling emergencies in the war room whenever key chain functionality has been impaired
* Collaborating with other teams to communicate chain functionality to maximize the value they can in turn offer others (e.g. to help inform how the indexing team should build new schemas for various applications)
* Participating in system architecture, protocol design, and decision-making to ensure security and minimize attack surface
* Keeping up-to-date with the latest developments in the Cosmos and broader crypto ecosystems, to always incorporate new best practices, techniques, and threat mitigations

  

### Key Requirements:

* 2+ years in an adversarial, blockchain environment writing production-grade, protocol-level code including core chain source code or smart contracts
* 4+ years writing production-grade, scalable Go
* Shape rotator; Can read and speak in math and abstractions
* Expert understanding of common crypto-economic primitives
* Previous experience at a crypto project that successfully navigated at least one, full cycle while actively battling typical adversarial forces inherent to crypto i.e. you worked at a noteworthy protocol
* Proactive, English-fluent communicator
* Fully immersed in, dedicated to, and bought-in to crypto

  

### Preferred Requirements:

* Experience building Cosmos SDK chains
* Can do their own DevOps
* Interest in Machine Learning
* Is a notable presence on CT
