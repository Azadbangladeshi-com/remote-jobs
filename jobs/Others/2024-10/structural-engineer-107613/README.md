Thanks for your interest in Oklo! We are searching for a Structural Engineer to join our team.

**Position Description**

A structural engineer at Oklo is responsible for design, analysis, and construction of buildings and structural components.

**Specific responsibilities may include:**

  * Design and evaluate structural elements for components within the reactor with considerations of other complex phenomena such as irradiation, high temperatures, etc.
  * Design structural elements of a building and other large, static structures, including structural framing and the foundation system.
  * Develop structural designs that consider energy efficiency, feasibility of construction, building code requirements, and cost minimization.
  * Familiar with industry codes and standards such as IBC, ASCE, AISC, ACI, AWS, ASME, etc.
  * Analyze structural elements to predict the impact of live load, dead load, and environmental loads such as wind, thermal, and seismic.
  * Use structural analysis to propose changes and iterate on the design of structural elements.
  * Provide input on construction-site investigation.
  * Collaborate with our engineering team and contracted architects to develop construction plans and blueprints.
  * Collaborate with our operations team to create and manage a construction project.
  * Document work using modern tools and techniques, and write well-written, thoughtful technical reports. 

**Competencies**

We are looking for a structural engineer that is:

  * Passionate about clean energy and making advanced fission a reality
  * Knowledgeable about structural design, analysis, and construction
  * Eager to work on a dynamic team, receive constructive feedback, and grow with us
  * Willing to think differently and learn quickly
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced, highly iterative startup environment
  * Excited to think creatively, critically, and reflectively about the problems they are solving, while not leaning only on what has been done before 
  * An excellent writer who can communicate technical concepts in modern active voice

**Who you are:**

A startup person: You aren't driven by titles or hierarchy, and prefer efficiency to excess process. You don't need or expect to have a lot of guidance but you enjoy working in a fast-paced team. If you prefer the culture and feel of a large organization, that is great, but you likely won‚Äôt enjoy working with us! There is plenty of important work and plenty of good opportunities with organizations like that.

_Motivated_ : You are self-motivated. You bring an enthusiasm to the team, and imbue a sense of passion that goes beyond clocking in and clocking out. This isn‚Äôt about a fake or arbitrary ‚Äúpieces of flair‚Äù mentality or lack of work-life balance! It is about being a part of the vision and feeling a part of reaching team goals.

_A team-player_ : Oklo genuinely is a team. We aren‚Äôt about taking credit for ourselves, and we aren‚Äôt about pushing blame to others. We do incredible things because we work as a team.

_An excellent communicator_ : We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator.

_Creative_ : Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day.

_Detail-oriented_ : This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.

**Minimum Qualifications:**

  * Bachelors, Masters, or PhD in civil, structural, or mechanical engineering
  * Experience in structural design and analysis, especially with metals, concrete, and high thermal loads
  * General knowledge of building construction methods, building systems, and cost implications
  * Experience with CAD or 3D modeling software
  * Experience with finite element analysis software for static and dynamic analysis such as ANSYS, LS-DYNA, Abaqus, COMSOL, Nastran, etc.

**About Oklo compensation:**

Salary: $70,000-$150,000

Salary may fall outside of the range provided and will be dependent on applicant experience.

Oklo offers flexible time off, equity, competitive pay, 401k, health insurance, FSA, flexible work hours, and other benefits.

We are looking to fill this position immediately!
