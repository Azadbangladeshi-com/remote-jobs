Reddit has a flexible first workforce! if you happen to live close to one of our physical office locations our doors are open for you to come into the office as often as you'd like. Don't live near one of our offices? No worries: You can apply to work remotely from the United States or Canada.

As a company, Reddit primarily generates revenue through advertising, and we're working towards building a massive business to fund our mission. We distinguish ourselves from other digital ad platforms by attracting advertisers who want to connect with a specific target audience because of our passionate and engaged communities.

The Advertiser Optimization team builds ad campaign optimizations that enable advertisers to efficiently capture user engagement while minimizing their costs. The team leverages machine learning models to incorporate advertisers off-site goals in auction ranking, allowing them to maximize installs, key conversions, or return on ad spend. As the primary owners of the budget pacing and autobidding systems, the team is responsible for a central part of the ads delivery system that automates bidding taking into account advertiser objectives, delivers advertisers budgets smoothly and completely throughout the day. Given the centrality of this system, the team also regularly conducts highly rigorous and controlled experiments in order to measure the impact of improvements to these systems. Some of the project highlights include:

  * A bid-based budget pacing system that delivers campaignsâ€™ budgets throughout the day.
  * The Maximize Conversions campaign optimization, which uses real-time bidding to meet advertisersâ€™ key objectives.
  * The Lowest Cost campaign optimization, which simplifies advertisersâ€™ experiences by automating campaign bids.
  * Cost caps that allow advertisers to get as much volume as possible without sacrificing their performance goals.
  * Campaign Budget Optimization that automatically manages budget across multiple ad groups and optimizes for maximum volume or maximum value based on advertiser settings.

As a staff machine learning engineer in the Advertiser Optimization team, you will work closely with technical leaders to build new advertiser optimization products like target CPA and target RoAS bidding, optimized CPM, view through optimization, etc that significantly increase the efficiency and ROI for the advertisers. You will be responsible for the quality and technical approach within the team; partner with other leads in direction setting, planning, and overseeing engineering designs and executions; establish and contribute to the groupâ€™s culture and processes. You will collaborate with cross-functional engineering, product, and marketing teams to ensure that our customersâ€™ voices are represented in your work. You will design, conduct, and analyze experiments to quantify the impact of the systems that you build.
