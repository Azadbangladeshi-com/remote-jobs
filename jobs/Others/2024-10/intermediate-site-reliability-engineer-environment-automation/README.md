  * Plan: Develop monitoring and alerting systems that predict capacity needs based on the customer usage patterns. Plan for new service rollouts, expansion of existing services and preparing advice for customers to optimize their resource consumption. 
  * Respond: Respond to user emergencies, platform alerts and support requests.
  * Enhance: Implement new, and update existing security measures for the protection of GitLab infrastructure.
  * Collaborate: Work with other engineering stakeholders on resolving larger architectural bottlenecks and participate by offering a large scale operational point of view. Work in close collaboration with software development teams to shape the future roadmap and establish strong operational readiness across teams.

  * US Citizen or Permanent Resident.
  * Have experience in running and operating production workloads.
  * Have strong programming skills - preferably with Ruby and/or Go.
  * Have a strong background with Infrastructure as a Code technologies, and libraries powering GitLab, such as: Terraform, Ansible. Experience with data templating tools such as Jsonnet would be considered a bonus.

  * Enjoy working with peers and collaborating across teams to deliver unique solutions to various technical challenges.
