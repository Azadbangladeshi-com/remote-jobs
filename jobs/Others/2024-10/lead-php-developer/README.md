It's a fact: datacenters are at the forefront of novel solutions and advanced technologies to keep up with their ever-growing demand. Why is this relevant to you? Because developers have the chance to work on complex, high-impact projects using cutting-edge technologies. Have we piqued your interest yet?

Our client provides enterprise-class managed data center services, and they want to make a new addition to their team to keep up with the 700% growth they've had in the past 6 years. They have around 70 datacenters servicing 29 different markets, and we can't disclose their clients - but think about any major industry player from hyperscalers, banks, healthcare and social media platforms, and they're likely in their CRM. The team you will be joining is modernizing a legacy ERP platform into current-day technologies. The scale of their applications are enormous, the amount of compiled DLLs are equal to the number of Spartans that Gerard Butler led into battle, and the number of records in their relational databases is more than the number of fans who saw Beyonce in concert this year. It's safe to say it's a very impactful project that you'll have the chance to work on.

You'll be building the API that feeds their external and internal applications, and allows their clients to engage with their systems and services worldwide. They're looking for someone highly skilled with PHP, MySQL, third-party API integration, and experience with high-availability and highly performant database and web platforms. You'll be leading a (growing) team of four developers, and you'll be encouraged to voice your opinion, debate about creative solutions, and foster a collaborative and supportive environment. Our ideal candidate is someone with great communication and development skills, highly adept at understanding where the team's attention needs to go, and managing it to reach the set objectives.

**The list of responsibilities includes:**

  * Contribute to the design and development of the client's API, supporting both internal systems and external portal.
  * Create internal tools to streamline and automate repetitive manual processes.
  * Ensure high availability and performance in the architecture of internal systems.
  * Utilize various database platforms and work with REST-based APIs.
  * Troubleshoot issues and implement new features in existing internal tools.
  * Oversee merge requests, package releases, and deployments (temporarily, until automation is implemented).
  * Support sprint planning and management, including leading daily team standups.
  * Conduct code reviews for developer submissions.
  * Evaluate deployments and provide insights for sprint retrospectives.
  * Guide and mentor developers to enhance coding skills and development practices.
  * Create documentation for development, design, and quality assurance.
  * Engage in hands-on development work for 40-50% of your time.

**What qualifications and skills are we looking for?**

  * Minimum 5 years of experience developing enterprise applications using PHP.
  * At least 3 years of experience designing high-performance, highly available applications and databases.
  * Minimum 3 years of experience integrating third-party APIs, with additional experience in developing and maintaining RESTful APIs being advantageous.
  * Proficiency in writing complex SQL queries for both Microsoft SQL and MySQL.
  * Familiarity with technologies such as Docker, RabbitMQ, Elastic Search, Jenkins, and Redis is beneficial.
  * Experience as a team lead (with or without the actual title) is strongly preferable, but if you checked off the previous points and feel you're ready for this next step in your career, be our guest!

If you got this far, then we assume we've definitely piqued that interest of yours! You'll be working alongside very talented and passionate developers, and the team culture is highly regarded within the company.
