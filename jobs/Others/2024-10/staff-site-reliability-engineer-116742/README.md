**POSITION SUMMARY**

As a Staff Site Reliability Engineer, youâ€™ll be the subject matter expert with operating systems and networking. Youâ€™ll understand how our services are performing, we use DataDog (Logging+Metrics+APM), and Cloudwatch (by way of Datadog) to alert with Slack or PagerDuty. We are strong believers in Infrastructure as Code. There are many ways to accomplish this, but we use Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes to make it happen. Our .NET Core/ Framework, Kotlin, Spring Boot, and Python applications run on AWS. We leverage a mixture of EC2, ASG, and EKS for computing, ELB, and AppMesh for load balancing and proxy, Kineses, SQS, and Kafka for streaming data, and DynamoDB, RDS, ElastiCache for state storage.

The base salary range for this role is $206,600 - $252,600 + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location.
