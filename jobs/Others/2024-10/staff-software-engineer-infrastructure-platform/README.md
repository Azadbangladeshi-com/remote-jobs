**About the role:**

Samsara is seeking an experienced Staff Software Engineer to play a leading role in our Infrastructure Platform team.

We achieve this by providing easy-to-use, self-service, secure by default, efficient, and reliable developer and operator capabilities via infrastructure, automation, tooling, & education. We create the foundations that our product teams build upon to rapidly experiment and iterate on new products and features.

Youâ€™ll be a thought leader on a team that maintains a catalogue of products we provide to the rest of engineering, like storage, computing, orchestration, and observability. Youâ€™ll make decisions with a significant impact on Samsara. There is a lot of work to do to make Samsara engineersâ€™ work easier and our platform even more reliable than it is today, and weâ€™d love for you to be part of it.

**This is a remote position open to candidates based in the United Kingdom**

**You should apply if:**

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** The software, firmware, and hardware you build will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  * **You want to build for scale:** With over 2.3 million IoT devices deployed to our global customers, you will work on a range of new and mature technologies driving scalable innovation for customers across industries driving the world's physical operations.

  * **You are a team player:** Working on our Samsara Engineering teams requires a mix of independent effort and collaboration. Motivated by our mission, weâ€™re all racing toward our connected operations vision, and we intend to winâ€”together.

**In this role, you will:** ****

  * Lead organization-wide projects and develop tools that improve how we deploy, orchestrate, scale, and monitor hundreds of microservices and databases
