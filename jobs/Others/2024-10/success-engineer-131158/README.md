### Metabase  
#### `üåé remote,Global Remote`  

## Description

Metabase is the easiest way for people to get insights from their data, from tiny startups who get up and running quickly to major corporations with tens of thousands of users. That's why people love us.

  

We bring data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to the crufty world of enterprise business intelligence. We provide an opinionated open source starting point for how companies should measure, analyze and share their data, which is used by tens of thousands of companies.

  

Metabase is looking for a customer-focused, highly technical **Success Engineer** to join our growing global team! We are looking for someone who loves data analytics, enjoys helping others, and is excited to work for a startup to help drive our Success Engineering team‚Äôs mission to help our customers be successful by guiding them on how to get data from all the various places it lives, transform it into useful shapes, or to convert their questions into actual queries that can be executed. You will help our customers design Metabase and everything around it to work best for their unique situations and troubleshooting issues as they occur.

  

A typical day will involve a mix of: helping our users (one to one), writing up your solutions to help our entire user community (one to many) and helping us maintain our reference applications. Any given week, you might talk to our users to hear what they‚Äôre trying to accomplish, construct SQL queries to analyze data in Metabase, drop into a programming language to debug an embedding issue, or collaborate with our writing team.

  

**Why Success?**

  

We are the voice for our customers. Our product team reviews our feedback, asks us for advice, and engages with our customers proactively. We have a writer on our team who reviews what questions our customers are asking and improves our documentation, so the next customer doesn‚Äôt have to ask. We also work closely with an engineering team focused on critical issues and our escalations, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about our customers being impacted by major bugs for a long time.

  

We‚Äôre 100% remote, and our operations are designed that way. People work during the times that work for them. You are not expected to be ‚Äúon‚Äù at all times, and there are no points for responding quickly to every Slack you receive.

  

We don‚Äôt overpromise our customers. Since we‚Äôre open source, our customers can see what we‚Äôre doing in our Github repository and our roadmap is publicly available for our customers at all times.

  

Many companies use the word ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù to describe jobs that are really sales jobs or account management jobs with quotas. We are not about that. We‚Äôre exclusively here to make sure our open source users, our future customers who are currently on trials, and our current paying customers all get the appropriate help they need to be successful.

  

If you want to take part and have a voice in a truly growing business, believe that BI analytics should be easy to use and set-up, and that self-service analytics should be a real thing and not just some marketing jargon that people put on their websites, please apply!
