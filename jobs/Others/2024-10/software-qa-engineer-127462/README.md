We are looking for a highly skilled and motivated Software QA Engineer to join our development team. The ideal candidate should have strong programming skills and a proven track record of owning the delivery of complex system components from design through deployment. You will collaborate with cross-functional teams to build scalable platforms and drive engineering productivity while focusing on quality, security, and best practices.

· Strong understanding of common architectural and design patterns.

· Emphasis on quality deliverables, including a focus on peer reviews and implementing automated testing platforms for unit, integration, and acceptance tests.

· Continuous improvement mindset throughout the SDLC, always questioning the "why".

· Balance long-term vision with short-term priorities in design and implementation decisions.

· Ability to develop designs for moderately complex features of the applications.
