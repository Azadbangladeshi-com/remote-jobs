**Bready* to make a change?**

Toast is driven by building the restaurant platform that helps restaurants adapt, take control, and get back to what they do best: building the businesses they love.

Weâ€™re building a brand-new team to put the power of the entire Toast platform into the pockets of restaurant managers and operators! With our new app, managers will be able to track the performance of their restaurant in real-time during service. Using their own phones, managers will fine-tune restaurant operations from the floor of the restaurant in response to real-world conditions. This new app will also help staff rapidly diagnose and fix unexpected issues with the help of Toast Customer Care. By leveraging native mobile apps, weâ€™ll provide a rich UX that makes it easier than ever to run a thriving restaurant with great service for guests and a strong bottom line.

Our team is very agile and extremely customer-focused. UX, PM, and software engineers will be working hand-in-hand every day, and the team works directly with pilot customers to get feedback. We have high standards for customer satisfaction, and we strive to deliver high quality features in rapid iterative cycles.

You will be a crucial part of the team, helping bring Sous Chefâ€™s advanced AI capabilities to mobile and beyond by enhancing user experiences and driving innovation.

Our products are built on top of SwiftUI and Combine. Weâ€™re leveraging the newest Swift Charts for the visualization and using GraphQL for the data API.
