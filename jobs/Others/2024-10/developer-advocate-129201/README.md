**WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU**

Everyone building with Retool is a developer we can help! Our growing developer relations team strives to inspire and enhance the entire developer journey. Situated under Retoolâ€™s marketing department, our efforts span all aspects of developer advocacy, engineering, education, and experience. We think Retool is rad and want to show the world just how.

**WHO YOU ARE**

You are a technologist. You understand how hardware and software and systems work together to solve (& inspire) all kinds of very human problems. You want everyone to be more capable and enabled to meaningfully use technology.

Developer experience is paramount. You know that a great product is only a piece of the puzzle, and that what makes a truly great developer-focused company is how you talk to, engage with, and support developers (often behind the scenes). Youâ€™ve found your calling at the intersection of engineering, community, and developer enablement.

Youâ€™re ready to use your unique talents in programming, writing, teaching, and advocacy to enable developers and builders to dream bigger and accomplish more.

**WHAT YOU'LL DO**

As part of a small developer relations team reporting to the Head of Developer Relations, you will find your personal mix of focused project work, perennial go-to activities, and handle a startling variety of work that will predictably interrupt your day-to-day. While there are many jobs to be done and even more to discover, our team scales and chooses our work with occupational happiness in mind.

  * Build with Retool! We canâ€™t truly engage developers unless weâ€™re engaged too. Youâ€™ll build apps and workflows for personal exploration, internal tools, use case-driven tutorials, and to integrate tools & services with Retool.
  * Collaborate with our content, support, and product marketing teams on programs, campaigns, and projects that enhance our developer community.
  * Speak at and participate in select conferences and events to educate the developer market and build lasting relationships with third party services and tools that would work well with Retool.
  * Engage with developers in our forums, on social media, YouTube, Slack, Discord, and anywhere else online developers are using or would benefit from using Retool.
  * Help us produce delightfully effective video content for developers.
  * Channel the voice of the Retool developer community and champion their feedback and concerns back to stakeholders in product and marketing. 
  * Keep a close pulse on trends in softwareâ€”from internal tools to languages, frameworks and databasesâ€” and be ready to form Retoolâ€™s position and perspective.

**THE SKILLS YOU'LL BRING:**

  * 2+ years in a programming-adjacent function at a fast-growing company, preferably in developer relations.
  * You and your particular mix of skills, history, and technical preferences. How will you Retool? 
  * Deep empathy for developers and a passion for helping them move their projects and careers forward.
  * Creative communication skills: youâ€™ll be a face of Retool to developers and will make a huge impact on how developers perceive the Retool brand.
