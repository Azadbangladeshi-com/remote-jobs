# [Senior Solutions Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-solutions-engineer-129839)  
### Posit  
#### `ðŸŒŽ USA - Remote`  

# **About the Team**

Positâ€™s Solutions Engineering team (Sol-Eng/SE) aims to reduce the distance between the customers of our Professional Products and our Pro and Open Source offerings.

We help our customers â€“ especially their IT/SysAdmin teams â€“ deploy, install, configure, and use our professional products. We aim to bring curiosity and empathy to every customer engagement, learning about how customers get value from Open-Source Data Science.

But thatâ€™s only half the job.

As we learn about what customers want and need, we use that knowledge to improve our products, documentation, and processes.

We currently are a team of 15, and anticipate substantial growth this year.

On Sol-Eng, youâ€™ll play an important role in both unblocking and empowering individual customers and making Posit and our products work better in the future.

# **People who thrive in this role tend to:**

  * Find joy in working directly with and unblocking customers. This role is at least 50% customer-facing.
  * Love learning and sharing your knowledge of the server infrastructure and architecture that underlies enterprise data science. Youâ€™ll be an advisor to IT teams who administer Positâ€™s products in a wide variety of architectures and with a range of integrations. You have exposure to some of these technologies (e.g. Cloud Services, Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, Slurm) and look forward to opportunities to dive deeply and learn in other areas.
  * Be curious about data science. Our tools enable customerâ€™s data science teams and you understand a successful deployment of Positâ€™s products can look different depending on their data science goals and workflows.
  * Be hungry and humble. Sol-Eng covers an impossibly broad technical scope. Great SEs quickly admit what they donâ€™t know and constantly seek to learn more.
  * Find excitement in having many demands on your time, rather than overwhelm. The SE team has close relationships with almost every other team at Posit. Thereâ€™s no limit to the different projects SEs could take on, being able to choose important things (with help and guidance from managers) and ignore distractions is a key skill for a Posit SE.

# **What youâ€™ll own own:**

  * The role of technical advisor for assigned customer accounts. Youâ€™ll guide these customers to successfully architect, implement, and/or administer the Posit products in their data science environments. Youâ€™ll collaborate with sales and customer success to enable the customer to realize the full value of their Posit environment. 
  * Post-sales engineering calls where youâ€™ll discuss potential server configurations and architectures with customers, help customers through the installation process, and share best practices and workflows for doing data science in R and Python using Positâ€™s Pro Products.
  * Responsibility for providing the voice of the customer to other teams at Posit, especially product management and product engineering.
  * A variety of projects that might include
    * writing and maintaining documentation, how-to articles, and demos of our products.
    * experimenting and documenting how our Pro Products work with new cloud technologies
    * exploring enhancements and integrations for our Pro and Open Source products, and helping the product teams incorporate what youâ€™ve learned.
    * creating and delivering public webinars, talks, and workshops.

# **What youâ€™ll help with:**

  * Improving our teamâ€™s processes so our workflows facilitate us doing great work, taking adequate focus time, and having time off to rest and recharge.
  * Setting the direction of our products by influencing the product management and engineering teams.

# **You will learn...**

So much.

No one has ever (or ever will) start on Sol-Eng knowing everything we do. Strong candidates for this role generally have prior experience with approximately half of the things below.

  * How to navigate deeply technical post-sales customer calls. Even people with substantial customer experience find that Sol-Eng demands new depths of empathy, curiosity, and clarity of thinking and explanation.
  * How Positâ€™s Pro Products work. On customer calls, you will be the expert on our Pro Products â€“ explaining how to install and configure them, as well as how they help make life better for data scientists.
  * How to speak fluently about enterprise infrastructure. Solutions Engineers help our customers IT/Admins determine the best product architecture for them, which requires they speak knowledgeably about integrations to other data (science) tools and platforms, and how to get things done on Linux servers including system administration, authentication, networking, and virtualization.

# **What to expect:**

## **Within 1 month, youâ€™llâ€¦**

  * Meet the rest of the SE team and start meeting CS, Sales, and other nearby team members.
  * Configure Positâ€™s Pro Products for yourself to start learning the ins and outs.
  * Have joined dozens of IT architecture and post-sales technical advisory calls with IT/Admins of Positâ€™s Pro products.

## **Within 3 months, youâ€™ll...**

  * Meet a large fraction of the company across SE, CS, Sales, Support, Marketing, Engineering, and more.
  * Lead architecture calls solo, helping our customers determine how Positâ€™s Pro products fit into their existing data and technology stacks.
  * Begin getting hands on with customers who are installing our products, looking over their shoulders and suggesting how to set up and configure their environments.

# **Within 12 months, youâ€™llâ€¦**

  * Contribute to projects in roles of escalating size and scope.
  * Take on larger, more strategic, and higher-touch customer engagements that might include weekly meetings with the same customer.
