## Description

At Instructure, we believe in the power of people to grow and succeed throughout their lives. Our goal is to amplify that power by creating intuitive products that simplify learning and personal development, facilitate meaningful relationships, and inspire people to go further in their education and careers. We do this by giving smart, creative, passionate people opportunities to create awesome products. And that's where you come in:

  

Weâ€™re hiring an awesome engineering leader to steer one of our Canvas teams! We're looking for someone who is passionate about technology and education to help build new features into our existing product Canvas and its services.

  

This role is a combination of the technical expertise of a software engineer with additional responsibility around the happiness and productivity of a cross-functional team. Youâ€™ll be expected to be a people, process, and technical leader for the team. Your team will be made up of software engineers working in concert with a product manager and a designer. You and your team will be responsible for the development, maintenance, and production operations of your services.

  

The Interoperability team owns how integrations with our customers and partners interface with Canvas. You and your team will be responsible for furthering our implementation of the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standard and driving how Partners and Institutions integrate with Canvas and the Instructure ecosystem.

  

Like our customers, we value a learning culture and expect our engineers to work closely with product and support to build the best possible solutions, not just write code to a spec. Engineers at Instructure enjoy an annual company-wide tech conference, biweekly tech talks, and quarterly Hackweeks, all designed to encourage as much exploration and learning as possible.

  

Much of our work is open source, including our primary product (Canvas). Check us out on Github: www.github.com/instructure.
