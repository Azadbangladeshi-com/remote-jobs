**About Us:**

Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses.

Weâ€™re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Floodgate, Y Combinator, DNX Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Justin Kan, Elad Gil, and more.

We value diversity â€” in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguideâ€™s team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As an early stage start-up employee, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitionersâ€™ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.

 **About the Role:**

As a Senior Platform Engineer, Machine Learning, at Fieldguide, you'll be responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that powers our ML solutions in the audit and advisory industry.

This is an opportunity to join as an early engineer at a company with product-market fit that still has huge amounts of room to grow.

  * Contribute to the development of internal tools and frameworks to improve ML workflow efficiency

  * Be an essential technical contributor at a Series B-stage company as it scales

  * Knowledge of data versioning and feature store technologies

  * Experience with high-volume, real-time data processing

  * Familiarity with data security and access control for ML systems

  * Experience with cloud cost management and optimization for ML workloads

  * Modern web tech stacks consisting of several of the following: GraphQL, NodeJS, Hasura, Postgres
