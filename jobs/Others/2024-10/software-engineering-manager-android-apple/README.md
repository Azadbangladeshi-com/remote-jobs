At Philo, weâ€™re a group of technology and product people who set out to build the future of television, marrying the best in modern technology with the most compelling medium ever invented â€” in short, weâ€™re building the TV experience that weâ€™ve always wanted for ourselves. In practice this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences.

### **Software Engineering Manager (Android, Apple)**

We are passionate about crafting the best possible UX to connect our users with the content they love, providing a seamless viewing experience while surprising them with new features and capabilities.

  * Manage the hiring and growth of the team as needed, working with recruiting to identify and onboard top engineering talent.
  * Manage day-to-day partnership operations with Apple, Google and Amazon. This includes working through technical integrations and ensuring that the app release process goes smoothly.

  * Experience working closely with technical leads and engineering teams to drive project execution and maintain high code quality standards.
  * Excellent communication skills and the ability to collaborate across teams and disciplines to achieve common goals.
