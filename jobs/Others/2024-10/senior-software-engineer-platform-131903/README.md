From the code to the values, we are Ethereum-aligned. We believe Ethereum has the potential to solve some of humanityâ€™s most crucial coordination issues. Since our initial inception as a non-profit research group, we have have sought to scale both its technology and values.

At present the most pressing bottleneck to the growth of Ethereum is its performance and scalability. We are building the most elegant solution to this problem. We do this out in the open because we believe in open source and its ability to accelerate innovation.

Not only do we improve Ethereum's performance by orders of magnitude, we donate 100% of the profits generated from doing so to Ethereum public goods. We do this because we believe the future of the open internet is too important to be left to chance. By operating as a Public Benefit Corporation we're able to align private incentives with public good and create a positive-sum economic model that provides a sustainable future for the internet.
