# **Hang is building the future of loyalty for brands.**

Hang is the next generation brand loyalty & membership platform. By harnessing the power of personalization, gamification, and its integrations ecosystem, Hang provides brands with a radically new type of loyalty experience for their customers.

Today, they work with a variety of major brands (such as Ulta Beauty, Budweiser, Flipkart, and more), as well as multiple well-known, up-and-coming restaurant chains (Boba Guys, Roam Artisan Burger, and Williamsburg Pizza, among several others).

Hang draws from years of deep expertise in loyalty, game design, and finance with employees from leading companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, LinkedIn, Coinbase, Square, and Goldman Sachs.

Hang raised a $16 million Series A led by Paradigm last summer, with participation from Tiger Global, Howard Schultz, Kevin Durant, Mr. Beast, and the founders of Warby Parker, Allbirds, and Bombas, among others.
