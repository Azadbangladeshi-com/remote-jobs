  * Be responsible for the organization‚Äôs CI/CD infrastructure and artifact storage systems
  * Deploy and maintain specialized tooling and services in our Kubernetes clusters

  * Build safer software delivery methods with techniques such as blue-green or canary deployments
  * Maintain and improve the reliability of our internal software
  * Build new features or new tools to help us solve the problems of the evolving organization
  * Improve testing and validation early in the process to prevent production issues down the line

You are a tinkerer by nature. You are both skilled in writing software and comfortable working on infrastructure.

  * You have 6+ years of site reliability engineering or relative experience.
  * You've set up delivery pipelines of various shapes and constraints.
  * You have an empathetic approach and enjoy working with developers, designers and product owners and constantly seek to understand their perspective.

  * You enjoy building and configuring containers and/or VMs.

  * You can dig and investigate into areas that may be new to you to solve problems.
  * You enjoy automating wherever and whenever possible.
