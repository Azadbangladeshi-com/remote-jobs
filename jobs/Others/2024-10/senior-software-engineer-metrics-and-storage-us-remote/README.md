## Description

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers. We founded our company on the insight that while there were excellent tools for developers to build better code, there were no similarly great tools to help ML practitioners build better models. Starting with our first experiment tracking product, we have since expanded our solution into a comprehensive AI developer platform for organizations focused on building their own deep learning models and generative AI applications.

  

Weights & Biases is a Series C company with $250M in funding and over 200 employees. We proudly serve over 1,000 customers and more than 30 foundation model builders including customers such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Toyota.

  

In this role you‚Äôll lead efforts to scale our metrics and storage engines to the needs of our rapidly growing userbase. You‚Äôll be instrumental in the evolution of our platform as we grow to ingest and query petabytes of data by making technical decisions that maximize the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of our systems.
