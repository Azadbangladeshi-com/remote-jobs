Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About MetaMask**  

Weâ€™re building for a future where the internet and world economy empowers people through interactions based on consent, privacy, and free association. Where both communities and individuals flourish. To accomplish that, weâ€™re working hard to make web3 accessible for everyone around the world.

MetaMask is both a crypto wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web. Our tools help people create communities, play video games, access financial services, make payments, invest in assets, protect against economic turmoil, and more. Our browser extension and mobile platforms meet the needs of millions of users and developers across the world.

**Originally a humble key manager, today MetaMask serves over 30 million monthly active users as a decentralized application development platform, an aggregator of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, and a decentralized identity manager.**

**What youâ€™ll do**

As a **Staff Engineer** on the **Extension Platform Team** , you will contribute to the development and maintenance of the platform architecture that powers MetaMaskâ€™s browser extension. Youâ€™ll work on foundational systems, state management, integrations, and quality enablement while collaborating with the team on complex and impactful projects. While this role involves significant technical leadership, it is a highly collaborative position, working alongside other engineers to help drive the future of the platform.

  * **Quality Enablement Systems** : Help improve automated testing frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and other quality-focused tools to ensure the delivery of reliable and high-performing releases.
  * **Build, CI, and Release** : Support the ongoing enhancement of the build and release systems, ensuring smooth deployment processes and optimizing workflows for various environments.
  * **Collaboration and Mentorship** : Work collaboratively with other engineers, sharing knowledge and providing guidance when necessary to improve overall technical standards and development practices.
  * **Problem Solving and Delivery** : Play a key role in addressing critical business challenges, contributing to the timely resolution of high-impact projects and production issues.
  * **Code Review:** consistently review your peerâ€™s code, providing feedback on architecture, API design, code correctness, quality and maintainability

  * Proven ability to efficiently tackle difficult bugs in a structured manner
  * Experience in making pragmatic trade-offs between technical debt and delivering business value.
  * Ability to work effectively within a collaborative team, influencing best practices and driving positive technical outcomes.

#### **Would be nice if you have these things too but as strongly needed**

  * Experience developing browser extensions
  * Experience with Redux or similar state management libraries.
  * Understanding of privacy and security best practices in Web3 applications.
