**About the team**

The Create:Remote Development team focuses on building cloud-based solutions to empower teams to build and deliver software more efficiently. The team focuses on two main areas: Workspaces and WebIDE. These tools allow developers write, build, test, and debug code without needing to set up a local development environment taking away the hassles weâ€™ve all been through with setting up and configuring complex environments.

The team is made up of experienced Engineers who care about contributing to the developer ecosystem; located across different time zones, async communication and manager of one is core to how we continue to deliver value to users. The Create:Remote Development team cares deeply about GitLabâ€™s core values and has principles that align with those values. We aim to fight for the user, question everything, embrace the challenge that is Software Development, lean into discomfort as an expected part of this process, keep the fun in the team and measure what matters. The team cares deeply about contributing to the GitLab community and the developer ecosystem as a whole.

As a Senior Backend Engineer, you will primarily work on our Workspaces offering which provide remote development solutions which enables developers to quickly spin up developer sandboxes. You'll work closely with other experienced team members, fostering a culture of continuous learning. Your role is key in shaping our product offerings and roadmap as an Engineer building tools that enable other Engineers to work efficiently and increase productivity without the hassles that maintaining a local development environment comes with. With the recent GA release of Workspaces earlier in the year, youâ€™ll be able to contribute towards making this a loveable product. Some items on our roadmap youâ€™ll help contribute to include supporting building and running containers in a workspace, multiple editors like JetBrains and JupyterLab, implementing Shared Workspaces which could improve pair programming and troubleshooting. True to our transparency core value, you can find some of the items on our
