# [Senior Software Engineer - Grafana Partner Datasources (Remote, Canada EST)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-grafana-partner-datasources-remote-canada-est)  
### Grafana Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Canada (Remote)`  

**This is a full-time remote position. We are looking for candidates in the Canadian Eastern time zones.**

Grafana Cloud is our composable observability platform that integrates visualizations on metrics, logs and traces with Grafana. It allows our customers to leverage the best open-source observability software without the overhead of installing, maintaining, and scaling their own observability stack.

The Grafana team within engineering is responsible for Grafana, the highly successful open-source project with over a million instances running in the wild as well as our Enterprise-ready Grafana Enterprise offering. Grafana is also the main frontend for Grafana Cloud where users can visualize their telemetry data as well as use our opinionated solutions for easier troubleshooting of both their infrastructure and their applications. As our SaaS business continues to grow, we've started to change Grafana's core architecture with the goal to be fully multi-tenant and scalable, as well as a solid platform for our opinionated Cloud apps.

As a Senior Software Engineer in the Partner Data Sources squad you will play a vital role in the development of data sources: plugins that provide visual query editors and the underlying mechanics to query and transform observability data for use in Grafana. The data sources owned by the Partner Data Sources squad are built in close partnership with the cloud service providers and independent software vendors responsible for the services these connect to.

Our groupâ€™s mission is to ensure that, through this work, as many users as possible are able to see the value of Grafana as quickly as possible by connecting to their data wherever it lives. We achieve this at scale, owning the deployment and operations of these data sources and supporting infrastructure on Grafana Cloud.
