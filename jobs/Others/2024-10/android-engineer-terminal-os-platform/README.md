## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

Stripe Terminal helps our users extend their online presence to the physical world. The Terminal teamâ€™s mission is to make it as easy for businesses to accept in-person payments as the Stripe API has done for online payments. Stripe was founded to make it easier for developers to accept payments. Weâ€™ve solved a small part of that problem, but our ambition is to go much further.

Android engineers on the Terminal team will build and enhance the Device Platform including the applications and services that run on the physical Terminal devices. This also includes building the frameworks for other engineers, both internal and external to stripe, to develop on our custom platform with ease.
