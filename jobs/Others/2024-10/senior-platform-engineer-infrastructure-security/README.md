**About Us:**

Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses.

Weâ€™re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Floodgate, Y Combinator, DNX Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Justin Kan, Elad Gil, and more.

We value diversity â€” in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguideâ€™s team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As an early stage start-up employee, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitionersâ€™ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.

 **About the Role:**

At Fieldguide, we believe building the future of trust starts with our infrastructure. The Infrastructure Platform team at Fieldguide is responsible for the stability, resiliency, security, and performance of the underlying infrastructure that powers the multinational Fieldguide cloud platform. Weâ€™re seeing incredible growth as more and more customers onboard onto our platform, and we have major infrastructure and security initiatives to accomplish throughout the next year.

We are on the lookout for an exceptional engineer to help lead our team in expanding, hardening, and optimizing our platform. In this role, you will be a key technical contributor collaborating with development teams and business leaders to ensure world-class scalability and reliability of our products.

Fieldguideâ€™s platform is primarily composed of TypeScript-based microservices and serverless functions. We manage our own Kubernetes clusters which run on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and we leverage Helm, GitHub Actions, and Terraform to do most of our heavy lifting.

 **What You'll Do:**

  * Serve as a steward of our platform by designing, implementing, and testing our infrastructure to meet our application feature and scalability goals

  * Foster a learning culture within the team by conducting code reviews, root cause analysis, and continuous learning exercises

  * Serve as a subject matter expert on our infrastructure to other teams seeking to build their services upon it

  * Coordinate closely with the Application pillar in our Platform team as we tackle major initiatives like multi-region deployments and telemetry improvements

 **About You:**

  * 5+ years of total experience in SRE, DevOps, platform, or infrastructure roles

  * Experience with high-uptime, globally distributed environments and IaC principles

  * Experience with cloud platforms, preferably AWS

  * Experience with container runtime architectures, preferably Kubernetes

  * Proficiency with at least one programming language, preferably Typescript, Python, or Go

  * Experience leveraging network and security concepts to meet business compliance needs

  * Experience with relational database design and administration

  * 1+ year in a startup environment or interest in working at a startup

 **We'd love to talk to you if you have:**

  * Deep knowledge of the Linux container and Kubernetes ecosystems

  * Experience with distributed system reliability and performance testing, such as chaos engineering practices

  * Extensive experience designing infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS)

  * Extensive knowledge of web application observability, ideally OpenTelemetry

  * Experience with vector storage and search tools, such as pg_vector or OpenSearch
