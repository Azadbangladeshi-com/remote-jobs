### Cloudflare  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Hybrid or Remote`  

#### **About the Team**

Cloudflare is redefining the way networks are run at scale. Our Network Services product suite puts the connectivity, scale, and performance of Cloudflareâ€™s global network in front of customersâ€™ network infrastructure and private networks, providing a single pane of glass for network connectivity, visibility, and operating network functions like DoS mitigation, Next-Gen Firewall, IDS/IPS, WAN optimization, Network Interconnects, and more. We are a team of engineers and product managers who obsess over quickly building products that solve real customer problems using innovative technologies and techniques which leverage Cloudflareâ€™s unique architecture and global network footprint.

#### **Cloudflare Network Interconnect**

Cloudflare Network Interconnect allows customers to connect their network infrastructure directly with Cloudflare â€“ rather than using the public Internet â€“ for a more reliable and secure experience. Customers can bring Cloudflareâ€™s full suite of network functions to their physical network edge, directly connected over direct 1Gbps, 10Gbps, and/or 100Gbps links.

  * Developing high performance networking software to connect some of Cloudflareâ€™s largest customers into Cloudflare via private links
  * Developing a robust and automated control plane to manage a fleet of custom network devices across the globe
  * Communicating results and updates through blog posts, internal talks, and tickets
  * Partnering with teams in the Network Engineering, Network Operations, Data Center Engineering, and Observability organizations to seamlessly integrate with wider Cloudflare systems to push forward the product roadmap and integrate customerâ€™s interconnects
  * Partnering with some of the best engineers and product managers to solve big problems

  * Expertise in L2, L3, and/or L4 networking protocols
  * Familiarity with network engineering and protocols used in data center switching and routing as well as Internet routing - BGP, BFP, OSPF, MPLS, etc.
  * Experience building on top of Linux kernel networking primitives â€“ netfilter, nftables, eBPF, tc, switchdev, network namespaces, etc
  * Experience designing and integrating RESTful APIs and backend systems
  * Excellent debugging and optimization skills
  * Attention to detail and ability to solve complex customer problems
  * Own solutions end-to-end and driving the design, development, and deployment process
  * Able to work across teams and level common, sustainable solutions
  * Creative, open-minded, collaborative problem solver
  * Focus on clarity in written and verbal communication
