### Bodo  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Remote`  

## Description

At Bodo, we are redefining whatâ€™s possible with Python for analytics, data engineering, and AI. Weâ€™ve developed the worldâ€™s first auto-parallelizing Python compiler, delivering HPC-level performance and efficiency for large-scale data processing. Now, we are building upon this foundational software and applying it directly to analytics and AI, empowering organizations of all sizes to new levels of efficiency, speed, and accuracy that could never before be met.

  

Our compiler technology has already empowered some of the worldâ€™s most data-driven companies to solve their data challenges with unprecedented speed and scalability. Backed by leaders like Dell Technologies, Snowflake, and AMD, and adopted by Fortune 10 customers, we are just beginning to unlock the true potential of data platforms.

  

Thatâ€™s why we call it Transformative Python.

  

Weâ€™re looking for talented engineers with a passion for compilers, HPC, and AI to join us on this exciting journey to reshape the future of data analytics.

  

 **About the Role**

Bodo is seeking a Senior Software Engineer with deep expertise in Compiler development and High-Performance Computing (HPC) to help evolve our groundbreaking Python-native compiler. You will have the opportunity to work on a cutting-edge engine that simplifies parallelization and optimization for data analytics and AI workloads, translating complex Python patterns into high-performance, parallel code. As a senior software engineer, you will be a key contributor in building and optimizing Bodoâ€™s compiler, ensuring it can handle massive data at unprecedented speed while remaining easy to use. You will help shape the future of data processing, building a system that is not only faster but scalable and efficient for real-world applications.
