## Description

Conversant Group is an IT infrastructure and security consulting company based in Chattanooga, TN. We have provided technical, organizational, procedural, and process consulting services internationally since the company was formed in 2009. Unlike many IT security companies, Conversant Group has a unique perspective: technology is a tool, nothing more. Technology should support the business, and the business should support the people.

  

 **About The Position:**

The Cloud Engineer will primarily support organizations in their efforts to migrate to Office 365 and/or upgrade their existing Office 365 services. In addition, the candidate should have hands-on, working knowledge of implementing and configuring Microsoft Intune. The successful candidate will have significant knowledge of the Office 365 platform and services, proven service configuration and troubleshooting skills, as well as knowledge of on-premises infrastructure. Experience with Microsoft 365 migrations and some hands-on knowledge of IaaS migrations to Azure and/or AWS is a plus. The engineer will support the Project Manager in gathering and analyzing requirements, solution design, and execution of the migration while delivering high customer satisfaction.
