**About Arithmetization**

The arithmetization team provides the constraint system underlying Linea‚Äôs zkEVM, the compiler which converts high level constraints to polynomial relations and the trace building and expansion tools. (Compiled) constraints and (expanded) traces are the inputs for producing cryptographic proofs of EVM execution. As such we work in close collaboration with the prover team.

**What you‚Äôll do**

  * Help Linea scale by optimizing trace production and complex trace manipulations
  * Help build a well tested, versatile and efficient constraint compiler and trace manipulation tool in Go
  * Use your Go skills to port existing functionalities of our current constraint compiler / trace expander to Go
  * Use your knowledge of compilers to enhance our constraints compiler
    * Augment its underlying DSL (e.g. by adding new cryptographic primitives)
    * Add optimizations (of the output constraint system, trace expansions, type system, ‚Ä¶) 
    * Help us work towards building a field agnostic zkEVM (e.g. by building high level ‚Äúfield agnostic‚Äù primities)
  * Work in close collaboration with the arithmetization and prover teams

**Would be great if you brought this to the role**

  * Experience working with compilers
  * Established Golang skills
  * Strong understanding of blockchain technology and the zkEVM layer 2 protocol.
  * Strong problem-solving skills and ability to think creatively.
  * Strong project management skills and ability to work independently and manage multiple projects simultaneously.
  * Strong communication and collaboration skills.
  * A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field.
  * Experience in blockchain development is a plus
  * Familiarity with zk-SNARKs or related zero-knowledge proof systems is a plus.

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We‚Äôre passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment‚Äîapply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.
