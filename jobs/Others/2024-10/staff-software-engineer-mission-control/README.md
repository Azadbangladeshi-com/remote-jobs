  * Strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Go, or Java, with a deep understanding of distributed systems and scalable backend infrastructure.
  * Experience with data processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Kafka, Flink, Spark) and proficiency in ETL workflows and data modeling best practices.
  * Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (AWS or similar), with experience designing and deploying robust, cloud-based systems for high-volume data processing.
  * Ability to work cross-functionally with data engineers, product managers, and stakeholders to turn data into valuable insights and drive the success of our partners.

### **Nice to Have:**

  * Experience with campaign management or ad tech platforms, particularly around ensuring the stability and performance of data pipelines in real-time and near-real-time environments.
  * Knowledge of SQL and NoSQL databases and familiarity with big data tools such as Redshift, BigQuery, or similar.
