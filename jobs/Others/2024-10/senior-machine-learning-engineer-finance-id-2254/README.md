This candidate will play a crucial role in leveraging AWS Bedrock to build and optimize models that automatically classify, extract information, and process various types of documents. This role requires a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, AWS cloud technologies, and MLOps practices. This machine learning engineer will be a key contributor in driving innovation and delivering impactful solutions to enhance our document processing capabilities.  
  
 **Responsibilities:**

  * IDP Solution Architecture: Lead the design and implementation of AI/ML solutions for IDP on AWS Bedrock, including model selection, training, optimization, and deployment. Focus on models that can accurately classify document types, extract key information (e.g., names, dates, amounts), and understand document structure.
  * AWS Bedrock Expertise: Demonstrate deep understanding and proficiency in utilizing AWS Bedrock services (e.g., Titan FMs, foundation models) for various IDP tasks, such as document classification, named entity recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), and information extraction.
  * Model Development and Optimization: Develop and optimize high-performance machine learning models using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy) for NLP and computer vision tasks specific to document processing.
  * MLOps Implementation: Implement and manage MLOps practices to ensure efficient model development, deployment, monitoring, and retraining within the IDP pipeline.
  * Cloud Infrastructure Management: Utilize AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3, Lambda, SageMaker) to build and manage scalable and cost-effective cloud infrastructure for IDP workloads.
  * Data Engineering: Collaborate with data engineers to design and implement robust data pipelines for efficient document ingestion, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
  * Technical Leadership: Provide technical guidance and mentorship to junior engineers, fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within the Document Services workstream.
  * Performance Optimization: Continuously evaluate and optimize model performance, identifying and addressing bottlenecks to improve accuracy and efficiency of the IDP service.
  * Research and Innovation: Stay abreast of the latest advancements in AI/ML, NLP, computer vision, and cloud technologies, exploring and evaluating new techniques and tools to enhance our IDP solutions.
  * Collaboration: Work effectively with cross-functional teams (e.g., product management, data science, software engineering) to deliver impactful IDP solutions that meet business requirements.

**What will help you succeed**

  * 5-7 years of experience in data engineering.
  * 3-5 years of experience with software development
  * Deep experience with Snowflake and Stored Procedures
  * Extensive experience working with Python and modern web frameworks
  * Experience with queueing systems (Celery, SQS, Pub/Sub, etc)
  * Expert level knowledge of Python 3, Object-Oriented Code & Design Patterns
  * Strong Experience with Python frameworks (e.g. Fast API, Flask, Django)
  * Strong Experience with REST APIs
  * Strong Experience with Git
