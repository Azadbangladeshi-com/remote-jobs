**About Us:**

Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses.

Weâ€™re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Floodgate, Y Combinator, DNX Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Justin Kan, Elad Gil, and more.

We value diversity â€” in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguideâ€™s team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As an early stage start-up employee, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitionersâ€™ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.

 **About the Role:**

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Fieldguide, you'll play a crucial role in developing and implementing ML-driven features that enhance our platform's capabilities in the audit and advisory industry. You'll focus on building first generation ML applications, particularly in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative AI, while contributing to the growth of our rapidly scaling Series B-stage company. This role requires a balance of practical application skills and the ability to conduct necessary research to solve complex problems.

This is an opportunity to join as an early engineer at a company with product-market fit that still has huge amounts of room to grow. Weâ€™re competing with legacy accounting and audit products that are 20+ years old and have negative NPS, yet do billions in sales and have seen little competition in a decade.

  * Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and map business problems to ML solutions

  * Design, develop, and implement ML models with a focus on NLP and generative AI applications

  * Curate, clean, and prepare data for model development and training

  * Conduct rapid prototyping of ML solutions to quickly iterate on ideas

  * Stay current with the latest advancements in ML, particularly in NLP and generative AI

  * Collaborate with the platform engineering team to integrate ML solutions into the overall product architecture

  * Implement data flywheels to continuously improve ML features through increased usage

  * Define and implement ML performance metrics

  * Contribute to the product roadmap with ML-driven feature ideas

  * Be an essential technical contributor at a Series B-stage company as it scales

 **About You:**

  * 4-5 years of experience in applied machine learning or related field

  * Strong proficiency in Python and its ML/data science libraries

  * Extensive experience with NLP techniques and generative AI technologies

  * Experience with LLMs and both text-to-text and text-to-image generative models

  * Proficiency in working with large datasets and creating ETL processes

  * Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and CI/CD practices

  * Ability to work in a fast-paced, changing startup environment

 **Nice to Haves:**

  * Experience with rapid prototyping of ML solutions

  * Familiarity with model deployment processes

  * Knowledge of ML ops and experience building automated ML pipelines

  * Experience with A/B testing and statistical analysis

  * Modern web tech stacks consisting of several of the following: TypeScript, React, GraphQL, NodeJS, Hasura, Postgres, and AWS

  * Background in or exposure to the audit and advisory industry

  * Experience presenting technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders

  * Experience mentoring or leading small teams
