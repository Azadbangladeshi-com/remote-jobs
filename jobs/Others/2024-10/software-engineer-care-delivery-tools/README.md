# [Software Engineer, Care Delivery Tools](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-care-delivery-tools)  
### Imagen Technologies  
#### `ðŸ’° $120,000 - $135,000` `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

Imagen Technologies is a high-growth healthcare startup enabling patients to be diagnosed, treated, and managed at their primary care appointment (vs. having to refer out to hospitals, imaging centers, and other slow and expensive options). Today, weâ€™ve built an AI-enabled platform that enables patients to receive immediate diagnostic tests, immediate results, and immediate next steps â€“ all in a single Primary Care appointment. For example: through our platform, women across the U.S. are now receiving comprehensive breast imaging, results, and specialist-driven next steps at their local Primary Care office, condensing a multi-month diagnostic journey into 60 minutes.

With over $160m in funding from Google Ventures and some of the largest clinical networks in the country, we are rapidly expanding this platform across the U.S. - from 16 states and 500,000 patients in 2023 to 20+ states and 1.5M patients in 2024. By 2026, we will be delivering care across 35 states and to more than 5m patients per year.

Weâ€™re looking for a full-stack software engineer to join a small, high-impact team that builds software to support our clinical operations teams and radiologists. This role is ideal for someone who is passionate about building software that will have a tangible impact on Imagenâ€™s ability to provide timely, accurate care to patients. This role will report to the manager of the Care Delivery Tools team.
