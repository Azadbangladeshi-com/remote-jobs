  * Willing to think differently and do things in new ways 
  * Comfortable in a fast-paced, highly iterative startup environment
  * Able to communicate technical content and results in written form and verbally

**Who you are:**

A startup person: You aren't driven by titles or hierarchy, and prefer efficiency to excess process. You don't need or expect to have a lot of guidance but you enjoy working in a fast-paced team. If you prefer the culture and feel of a large organization, that is great, but you likely won‚Äôt enjoy working with us!

_An excellent communicator_ : We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator.

_Creative_ : Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day.

_Detail-oriented_ : This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.

**Minimum Qualifications**

  * Proficiency with thermal-hydraulics analysis
  * Bachelors, Masters, or PhD in a technical field, such as nuclear, mechanical, or aerospace engineering
  * Experience with systems-level analysis codes such as SAS4A/SASSYS-1, SAM, RELAP, TRACE, GOTHIC, or equivalent is highly recommended

  * Fluency with Python

**Bonus Qualifications**

  * Core competencies in heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and thermodynamics first principles
  * Professional experience developing or amending safety case analyses on high-hazard or highly-regulated facilities
  * Prior experience developing or amending safety bases and associated documentation for NRC-licensed or DOE-authorized nuclear facilities
  * Experience with specific safety analyses (e.g., steam link break or fuel relocation analysis)
  * Knowledgeable about fast reactors and fuel cycle activities
  * Competency with modern software engineering practices and programming languages
  * Experience with CI/CD computing environments
