Emerging Technologies & Incubation (ETI) is where new and bold products are built and released within Cloudflare.

**About the Team**

Workers AI is Cloudflareâ€™s AI inference service, enabling customers to use a wide variety of AI models both within Cloudflareâ€™s Workers development platform and via API. The Workers AI team owns the whole stack that powers the product, from front-end development all the way to low-level inference code. Accordingly weâ€™re a team with a diverse array of technical skills, but everyone on the team is curious and passionate about the possibilities of generative AI.

You will be a technical leader using quantitative metrics to help the team deliver improved flexibility and performance across the platform. This is a distributed systems role, and you will bring experience and expertise to the team in the areas of load balancing, scheduling, and resource sharing.
