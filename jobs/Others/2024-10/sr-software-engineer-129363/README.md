**About the Team**

As part of the Ceros Product team, you‚Äôll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you‚Äôve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.

We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren‚Äôt afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much. As a member of a remote-first team, you embrace transparency and collaboration.

**The Role**

Designing and building the Ceros platform is an ambitious task. We require the best-of-the-best Software Engineers, Designers, and Quality Engineers, ready to build a best-in-class web content design studio, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what‚Äôs currently possible.

Our software engineers are all full-stack, able to handle whatever work comes their way. This role is no different, however, we anticipate the responsibilities being initially more frontend focused. Working with Software and DevOps Engineers, you‚Äôll be focused on internal developer efficiency, tackling initiatives such as build time reductions, local development environment improvements, and API refactoring.

We're refactoring a key part of our product to introduce new features that will help our customers take their content creation to the next level. This is a greenfield project focused on innovating a specific component of our product, not merely replicating it. As a candidate, you would be joining one of our modernization teams dedicated to this refactor, playing a crucial role in shaping the future of our product. Our technology stack includes Web Components, React, NextJS, AWS Aurora, Yjs, Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, and WebDriver.io, among others. While we‚Äôre driving this innovation, we remain committed to preserving the strengths and stability of the existing product.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Writing well-architected, maintainable code (probably goes without saying)
  * Planning and leading high-complexity stories and epics
  * Reviewing story plans and offering insights on impacts to other parts of the application
  * Collaborating closely with the Quality Engineering team to write and maintain automated and regression tests, ensuring robust and reliable code
  * Participating in constructive code review sessions that focus on quality and productivity, while balancing the need to ship features in a timely manner
  * Focusing on delivering an exceptional user experience, with a strong attention to detail that reflects our commitment to creating intuitive and effective products
  * Participating as a primary on-call resource for service disruptions on rotation
  * Suggesting new technologies and techniques to improve engineer productivity
  * Collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices
  * And finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it

**Practical stuff we anticipate you having**

  * Track record of project ownership and exceptional product delivery
  * Competent in React, TypeScript, Node.js and SQL
  * Knowledgeable on best practices in front-end architecture
  * Experience working across a broad spectrum of the tech stack, with the ability to assist in tasks such as writing Terraform resources, creating GitHub Actions, or developing API endpoints, in addition to a primary focus on frontend development.
  * Experience working on no-code/whiteboarding/collaboration platforms 

**What we're looking for from the heart**

  * You excel in navigating ambiguity, where complex and evolving requirements are more typical than clear-cut customer demands
  * You approach large challenges incrementally, preferring a test-and-learn methodology over prolonged heads-down development
  * You are self-motivated and proactive, with progress often driven by your own initiative and that of your team
  * Experience in a fast-moving startup environment desirable
  * You look to uplevel others around you, supporting teams outside of your specific project

**Key Things to Know**

  * This is a full-time position
  * This is a remote-first role, working hours aligned with European time zones
