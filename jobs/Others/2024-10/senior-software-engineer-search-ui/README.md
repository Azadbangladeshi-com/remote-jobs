# [Senior Software Engineer, Search UI](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-search-ui)  
### Cribl  
#### `ðŸŒŽ USA - Remote`  

**Why You'll Love This Role**

Are you excited about enabling customers to find, analyze, and visualize their operational data, no matter where it lives, regardless of format or storage medium? Do you enjoy data visualization, performant and scalable user interfaces, query languages, and working on cutting edge technologies?

Cribl Search flips observability on its head by distributing queries to where your data already lives and aggregating the results - no more expensive data replication, centralized aggregation, megaIOPS+petabyte storage, or kilocore+terabyte hosts required to see whatâ€™s going on in your deployed environments. Want to find specific events, trace an execution, identify a threat, or graph metric trends from (ex.) data stored in EBS volumes, Cribl Edge nodes, S3 buckets, Azure blob stores, containers, RDBMSes, data lakes, or even a custom datastore? How about being able to do that from a single pane, regardless of heterogeneous storage / location / hosting / on-disk format? Thatâ€™s what Cribl Search enables, and we think itâ€™s a game-changer for helping Cribl become the data engine for IT and security.

Cribl is looking for a front-end focused Senior Software Engineer to collaborate on a remote-first, diverse, inclusive, cross-functional team of software developers as we build the Cribl Search user experience. You will play a central role in designing and developing user interfaces and visualizations that are scalable, robust, and user-friendly. This role is ideal for someone who is passionate about building high-performance web applications in a dynamic, collaborative environment.

On top of it all, you will have fun! Cribl strives to be a great place to work for everyone.
