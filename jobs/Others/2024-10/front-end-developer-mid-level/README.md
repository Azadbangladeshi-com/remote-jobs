### None

Coder is on a mission to build enterprise software that makes developersâ€™ lives easier and keeps them in flow. We seek a **Front End Developer** to join our marketing team and play a critical role in driving our growth by maintaining and enhancing coder.com and our other web properties.

As the primary gateway for new users and customers, coder.com is at the forefront of our acquisition strategy. You will have the opportunity to shape the first impression of our brand, creating influential web experiences that motivate developers and decision-makers alike. You will also collaborate with Product Managers and Technical Writers to ensure our documentation site is fast, functional, and engaging for new open-source Coder users and enterprise customers with established Coder deployments.

 **Still with us? You will stand out if you:**

  * Consistently go above and beyond and strive to improve everything you touch to benefit yourself and those around you

  * Demonstrate intellectual curiosity by continuously experimenting and optimizing web experiences for incremental conversion rate gains

  * Provide feedback actively, collaborate effectively, and think critically about the bigger picture. Youâ€™re part of our mission, not just an order-taker  

 **Requirements:**

We are targeting **3+ years of experience** in the following areas:

  * Develop websites using NextJS and Typescript

  * Use Figma to get the necessary information to develop what is needed

  * Fetch data from third party APIs such as CMSs or GitHub

  * Use animation and transitions to make the components more dynamic

  * Create visual/snapshot tests to make changes that are not breaking other parts of the website

  * Ability to share portfolio when applying

 **Bonus tacos if you:**

  * (Tacos? Yes. If you need an ice-breaker, ask how we say thanks by giving tacos)

  * Have experience using MUI and Storybook to develop and maintain components

  * Possess an eye for design and user experience - you donâ€™t need to be a designer, but it helps if you know your way around Figma and can spot (and fix) an illogical user flow

  * Understand what makes open-source developer communities tick. Coder is a steward of the open-source community, and this understanding will accelerate your ramp time

  * Have built or contributed to developer tools in a previous role or as personal projects

 **Interview Process**

We believe that the interview process should be consistent and enjoyable. We hope to get through the interview process in two to three weeks if schedules allow. During this time, you will be able to meet a mix of individual contributors, managers, and leadership. If this position requires a take-home assessment, we will compensate you for your work and time after completion.

**Coder is a Proud Equal Opportunity Employer**

We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to qualified applicants and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, pregnancy, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, age, marital status, genetic information, disability, protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local laws.
