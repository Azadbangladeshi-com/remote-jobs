## Description

Working at The Adaptavist Group

  

The Adaptavist Group is a global family of companies with a common goal. We combine the best of teamwork, technology, and processes, helping all kinds of businesses be better today and tomorrow.

  

We are experts at delivering enterprise software, tailored solutions, and quality services across some of the worldâ€™s most trusted technology ecosystems, including Atlassian, AWS, Slack, GitLab, Monday.com and Aha!

  

We make change happen. From anywhere.

  

Our flexible, remote-first way of working means that work can fit around your life, rather than your life fitting around work.

  

 **Working at** Venue.sh **(part of The Adaptavist Group)**

  

Venue.sh is a DevOps platform hyper-focused on the Developer Experience. It allows teams to work collaboratively and cohesively in building and deploying code to any destination and ensures everything you do is repeatable and scalable.

  

Our mission is to distill the latest concepts and experimentation in the DevOps field into a unique and valuable experience for developers. We aim to make a wonderfully smooth journey from ideation to product delivery to production, where the developer can focus on code while our platform handles all the tooling, glue, and relating it all together. And it all starts with you!

  

Working at Venue.sh is unlike any other job youâ€™ve ever had. We trust you from day one. We encourage curiosity. We champion diversity. Weâ€™re never afraid to try something new.

  

Excited yet?

  

Our flexible, remote-first way of working means that you can now fit work around your life, instead of trying to fit your life around work. You can even take as many holidays as you want. Yes, really!

  

As part of The Adaptavist Group, we make up a family of brands that combine people, processes, and technology to make businesses better.

  

Offering trusted consultancy, app development, training, hosting, and licensing, we believe our unique and open culture underpins our status as the go-to partner of choice within the Atlassian Ecosystem.

  

 **About the team**

  

The Venue.sh core team is an eager bunch of individuals coming together to build awesome solutions as part of the Venue platform. We span the gamut from highly technical developers to visionaries trying to predict the next big thing.

  

Our members are based in the USA, Canada and the UK, and weâ€™re now looking for our latest hire to join us remotely in Canada. Weâ€™re constantly looking to evolve our product and striving to provide a platform for each other so weâ€™re able to do our best work day in, day out. We pride ourselves on being a technically strong, supportive and friendly semi-autonomous team.

  

 **About the role**

  

Do you want to work alongside a talented Software Engineering team working on a world class product? Are you geeking out about the latest software development frameworks? What is your reputation score on StackOverflow?

  

You will contribute and lead engineering best practices within the Venue.sh team to guarantee the reliability and scalability of our product. You will also be responsible for driving technical discussions on Backend engineering, but not be limited to the stack. As a Senior Software Engineer, you mentor your peers and work together towards technical problem-solving, code quality review, and feature discovery. The Venue.sh engineering team works closely with the product and design teams. Your involvement in requirement refinement and investigation is critical. This is an individual contributor role where expertise in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is highly valued in building a DevOps platform with optimal developer experience (DevEx).
