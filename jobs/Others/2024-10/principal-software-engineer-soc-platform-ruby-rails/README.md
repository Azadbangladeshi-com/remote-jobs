**Reports to: Engineering Manager**

**Compensation:** **$190,000 to $215,000 base plus bonus and equity**

**What We Do:**

Founded in 2015 as a fully remote company by former NSA cyber operators, Huntress was built on a simple premise: to force hackers to earn every inch of their access.

Todayâ€™s cyber-attacks arenâ€™t limited to large organizations with the security tools that can ward off threats. Hackers don't discriminate and will find a way to penetrate any vulnerability in any size business, which is why Huntress focuses on protecting those small to midsize businesses that make up the backbone of our economy.

Huntress stops hidden threats that sneak past preventive security tools by utilizing our award-winning security platform and expert human threat hunters through dynamic products, including Managed EDR, MDR for Microsoft 365, and Managed Security Awareness Training.

Join the hunt and help us stop hackers in their tracks!
