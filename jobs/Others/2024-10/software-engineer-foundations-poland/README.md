## ðŸš€ Whatnot

Whatnot is a livestream shopping platform and marketplace backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator, and CapitalG. Weâ€™re building the future of ecommerce, bringing together community, shopping and entertainment. We are committed to our values, and as a remote-first team, we operate out of hubs within the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Germany today.

Weâ€™re innovating in the fast-paced world of live auctions in categories including sports, fashion, video games, and streetwear. The platform couples rigorous seller vetting with a focus on community to create a welcoming space for buyers and sellers to share their passions with others.

And, weâ€™re growing. Whatnot has been the fastest growing marketplace in the US over the past two years and weâ€™re hiring forward-thinking problem solvers across all functional areas.

## ðŸ’» Role

You will work in cross-functional multidisciplinary teams, allowing you to directly impact the reliability of our platform. Your designs, code, and ideas will contribute to solving some of the most complex technical challenges we face today, and help define future engineering initiatives.

Some sample projects you might work on are:

  * Driving architectural changes to improve reliability and scalability
  * Improving observability
  * Graceful degradation and automatic failover mechanisms for core business flows
  * Reliable end-to-end communication
  * Chaos engineering tools & tests
  * Stress-testing tooling
  * Providing other engineering teams with core primitives for networking, overload protection, and data access 

Team members in this role are required to be within commuting distance of our KrakÃ³w, Poland hub.

## ðŸ‘‹ You

Curious about who thrives at Whatnot? Weâ€™ve found that low ego, a growth mindset, and leaning into action and high impact goes a long way here.

As our next Software Engineer, you should have 5+ years of infrastructure engineering experience, building scalable systems that can handle millions of users, plus:

  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience.
  * Previous experience at a hyper-growth startup. Youâ€™re a self-starter who can hit the ground running with little direction.
  * Prior experience in a public cloud environment (AWS, GCP) using Kubernetes, Docker, and/or Terraform.
  * Exceptional coding skills and the ability to ship new products lightning-fast. We primarily use Python, Elixir, JavaScript, but previous knowledge of each is not required.
  * Excellent communication and writing skills.

## ðŸ’› EOE

Whatnot is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We value diversity, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, parental status, disability status, or any other status protected by local law. We believe that our work is better and our company culture is improved when we encourage, support, and respect the different skills and experiences represented within our workforce.
