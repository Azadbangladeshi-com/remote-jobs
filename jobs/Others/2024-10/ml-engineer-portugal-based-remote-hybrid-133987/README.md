 **The AI Team**

  

The main goal of the AI Team is to leverage AI and ML to provide high-quality clinical care at unprecedented levels of personalization and scale. In this regard, in close collaboration with the clinical team, we develop ML-powered features that identify the best course of action for each patient at any given moment or circumstance whilst employing a holistic perspective but also contemplating any relevant nuance. We also work on ensuring the overall experience is as close as possible to a 1:1 session with a Physical Therapist and thus play a crucial role in enabling the AI Care provided by Sword.

  

\- e.g., a decision support system for clinical prescription management, a ranking system to direct attention to members requiring assistance, and an engagement system surfacing the most relevant data points for any given communication.

  

Examples of this are projects like ‚ÄúPhoenix‚Äù and all the decision support systems that empower our Physical Therapists to provide world-class care to our members

  

As for the near future, our focus will be on taking the degree of personalization and human touch of our AI care to a whole new level by leveraging the most recent developments in the Generative AI field.
