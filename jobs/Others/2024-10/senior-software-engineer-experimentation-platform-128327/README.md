### About the role:

Reddit is poised to rapidly innovate and grow like no other time in its history, and the Reddit Experimentation Platform is a critical accelerant of that growth. The mission of the Experimentation Platform Team is to help Reddit developers execute more experiments and measured rollouts with larger user benefits and less effort. As an engineer on the Experimentation Platform Team, you will have Reddit-wide impact. We are excited about empowering innovation at Reddit through actionable and trustworthy experimentation at scale. If youâ€™re passionate about building products that change people's lives for the better, developing strategies for improving huge-scale products, building-testing-shipping in weeks (not months), and maintaining high-quality work-life balance, then Reddit will be the perfect home for you.

We are hiring a Senior Software Engineer, who will play a critical role in making Redditâ€™s experimentation platform world-class. We seek a candidate who can bridge the gap between our user-facing features and the underlying infrastructure.

  * Develop and operate high scale data products with a focus on live site reliability, trustworthiness of analyzed data, and debuggability/actionability for feature teams.
  * Increase developer efficiency through automation, improved signals, workflow streamlining and system optimization.
  * Collaborate cross functionally within the Experimentation Platform Team and across the whole company to find technical solutions to complex design challenges.
  * Participate in the full development cycle: design, development, impact assessment, and deployment.

As a senior engineer on this team, youâ€™ll be immediately responsible for building and driving a vision for our experimentation platform with immediate impact on services across Reddit. Youâ€™ll draw on your technical expertise and leadership skills to ensure our experimentation offering is cohesive and provides maximum value to an ever growing engineering organization. Youâ€™ll look for ways to bring in good ideas from other peers and also for opportunities to engage with org, presenting and sharing the teamâ€™s accomplishments.

  * _Collaborate:_ Work together with a variety of cross functional teams across Reddit.
