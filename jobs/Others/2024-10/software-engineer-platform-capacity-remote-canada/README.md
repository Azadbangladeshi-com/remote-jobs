#### This is a remote position and we're considering candidates in Canada only.

### About our Platform (at Grafana Labs):

Grafana Cloud moves millions of metrics, log lines, and traces per second from our customers' environments into a highly available, low-latency stack that processes and stores these data and serves them to dashboards and alerting tools. We aim to grow this to hundreds of millions per second, and it's critical that as we grow, we improve our performance, increase our reliability and security, and, of course, do it efficiently and effectively.

The Internal Engineering Platform delivered by the Platform department provides application engineers with the tools, systems, and Kubernetes clusters they need to build, deploy and run their workloads. Platform roles at Grafana Labs have an eye for engineers with a passion for performance and reliability, and who enjoy taking projects from conception to production. We organize ourselves into squads to allow focus on Cloud Infrastructure, Networking, and Security; engineering Productivity; Capacity management, Client Administrative Tooling (CAT); and US Federal compliance.

Because we deploy production services, we have on-call rotations to ensure the health of the system. Everyone at Grafana Labs tries to incorporate and use our product lineup into their day-to-day, so being on call is an important way to understand our system and how people use our products.
