 **About the role**

Dune is pushing the boundaries of real-time data processing, and we’re looking for a talented Rust Engineer to help us build and optimize the next generation of APIs. As an engineer on DevX at Dune, you’ll play a crucial role in developing high-performance, real-time systems that power crypto applications. You’ll work on some of the most cutting-edge technologies directly impacting the user experience.

 **In this role, you will:**

  * Design, implement, and maintain high-performance, real-time APIs using Rust, ensuring they meet the industry-pioneering performance and stability requirements of our users.

  * Work closely with the team to develop new features, such as better interpretation layers, enhanced data decoding, and improved API coverage for various blockchain data.

  * Work on performance improvements such as optimizing CPU usage, improving latency, and implementing caching strategies for better data fetching.

  * Explore and implement cutting-edge data storage solutions, improvements, and future explorations.

  * Focus on stability improvements, improving recovery processes, and enhancing the robustness of our real-time systems.

  * Contribute to the internal developer experience by improving local test setups, integration tests, and incremental deployment processes.

  * Work on one of the fastest engineering teams in the industry  

 **You might be a great fit for this role if you:**  

  * 4+ years experience including 6+ months of working with Rust. 

  * Have a deep understanding of systems programming concepts, particularly in high-performance or real-time applications.

  * Are familiar with technologies like Parquet or similar and have experience optimizing data storage and retrieval processes.

  * Know how to go deeper than “just use postgres” when building software.

  * Enjoy tackling performance problems, optimizing CPU usage, reducing latency, and implementing efficient caching mechanisms.

  * Have a strong ability to diagnose complex problems, particularly in distributed and real-time systems, and implement efficient solutions.

  * Work well in a team environment, are comfortable discussing technical issues, and can effectively collaborate with other engineers to achieve common goals.

  * Are excited about exploiting old and exploring new ways to improve system performance and reliability.

 **Perks and Benefits**

  * A competitive salary and equity package 🚀. Both salary and equity is top 25% of companies in the space

  * Our employee equity scheme has world-class employee-friendly terms with a heavily discounted strike price (~90%) and a 10-year exercise window

  * 🏖 5 weeks PTO + local public holidays (that can be swapped to suit you)

  * 🧑‍💻 A fully remote-first approach within a distributed team with flexible working hours; you structure your own day 

  * Say goodbye to meeting overload! We believe in a healthy mix of async and sync work, so you can focus on what truly matters—no more wasted time on endless meetings!

  * Good health is important, so we offer private medical insurance, dental & vision as standard __ 🩺

  * We believe in paid parental leave 👶 to help you celebrate this important milestone, transition to your new life, and bond with your new baby. We offer 16 weeks to primary caregivers and 6 weeks to secondary caregivers, fully paid. Plus a 2-week part-time phased return at full pay to help you get used to your new (and slightly more complex!) schedule

  * Quarterly offsites in various exciting locations as a company or team to connect, work together and have fun (so far in Tuscany 🇮🇹 Berlin 🇩🇪 Austria 🇦🇹and Athens 🇬🇷).

  * On top of this 👆each person gets a yearly travel allowance to connect and co-work with someone or a team of people for a few days.

  * An allowance for your at-home setup, to ensure you are happy, comfortable and productive. If you prefer a local co-working space, we’ll pay for your desk.

  * Work with some of the best people you’ll ever get to meet!

  * And of course, you get some awesome Dune swag! ✌️😎
