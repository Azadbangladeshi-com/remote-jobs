You are curious and self driven, with a strong understanding of the Engineering-QE relationship throughout the software development life cycle. You have strong manual testing skills, and are proficient with the creation and maintenance of automated test cases. You are energized by opportunities to streamline QE planning and test execution, improve automation, advocate for strong test engineering practices, and everything else that ensures a maintainable, quality product from the ground up. You, like us, are passionate about using software to solve real world customer challenges. You have worked in distributed teams, leveraging strong communication skills across multiple collaboration platforms to maintain alignment across multiple time zones.
