**About the Team  
** GOAT Group represents the leading platforms for authentic sneakers, apparel and accessories.Operating four distinct brands‚ÄìGOAT, Flight Club, Grailed and alias‚ÄìGOAT Group has a global community of more than 60M members across 170 countries. As an engineer at GOAT Group, the work you do will change the way the world shops and the way we operate as a company.  
  
As a Backend Engineer at GOAT Group, you‚Äôll own and build the platform that backs GOATs global marketplace. This platform connects over 60M buyers and sellers, along with dozens of warehouses and retail stores, across a variety of clients (web properties, mobile apps, API partners, internal services, etc.) and brands (GOAT, Flight Club, Grailed, alias). The problems you‚Äôll solve will range from how to launch high-scale sneaker and apparel drops, to how to equip our sellers with live and meaningful market data, to how to optimize fulfillment within our expansive international network.

**In this role, you will:  
** As a member of the Pricing Team, you‚Äôll play a critical role in this platform, ensuring that buyers and sellers always see the best and latest prices for all products on the marketplace. First and foremost, this means building and maintaining GOAT‚Äôs dynamic pricing algorithm, which uses product prices, inventory locations, fulfillment costs, and trade and tax regulations to compute a regional low price for every product. It also means building tooling to configure and test this algorithm, as well as owning the underlying pipeline that updates these prices in real-time and keeps them consistent across the platform (from checkout to product pages to search, etc.). And since Pricing plays at least some role in the display of almost ‚Äúeverything with a dollar sign‚Äù, you‚Äôll contribute heavily to shared features like checkout, offer settlement, tax remittance, accounting, and more.

  
Specifically, we‚Äôre looking for a high Senior or Staff level engineer to help mature the Pricing platform and keep it stable, scalable, and easy to understand as new features and complexity get added. To do this well, you‚Äôll need to acclimate quickly to a large existing codebase, build informed opinions supported by observation and evidence, communicate clearly in spite of complexity, and manage risk while still being proactive and outcome - oriented. And as an expert and potential technical lead on the team, you‚Äôll have significant opportunities for leadership and growth, and to make a lasting impact at GOAT.

  
**We are looking for:**

  * 7+ years of experience in backend software engineering (preferably in Golang or Ruby)
  * Experience with relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (dynamoDB) data stores
  * Experience working on large, production, customer-facing systems
  * Experience working as a service owner or technical lead
  * Experience collaborating with non-technical stakeholders to bring clarity to complex business problems
  * Experience, comfort, and interest in working with and improving large codebases
  * Experience with both monoliths and service-oriented architectures
  * Experience working on features related to e-commerce, pricing, or checkout
  * A self-starter with a high attention to detail and strong communication skills
  * An interest in taking on more scope and responsibility over time
  * BS degree preferred
  * Bonus: Engineering experience at a public e-commerce or marketplace company
  * Bonus: Engineering experience at a successful IPO-stage startup
