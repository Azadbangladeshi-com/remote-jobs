Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

The Attacker Engineering team performs offensive security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in Stripe's systems, applications, and networks before they impact Stripeâ€™s business or users.

The team is distributed, working primarily in Eastern and Pacific time zones, and will regularly coordinate with stakeholders in Europe and Asia.

## **What youâ€™ll do**

Using your security expertise, you'll uncover security weaknesses within Stripe by simulating the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real-world adversaries. This will involve utilizing both threat intelligence and collected telemetry to emulate cyber and criminal threat actors who may target Stripe. Lastly, your analytic capabilities will be critical during security incidents to reduce uncertainty, uncover root causes, and inform future prevention and detection mechanisms.

  * Act as the subject-matter expert and primary contact for stakeholder teams invested in offensive security programs and Stripe-wide security initiatives
  * Collaborate effectively with teammates, leading projects, mentoring others, and developing and championing quality standards within the team
