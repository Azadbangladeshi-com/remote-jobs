## An overview of this role

As a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at GitLab, you are responsible for keeping all user-facing services and other GitLab production systems running smoothly. SREs are a blend of pragmatic operators and software craftspeople that apply sound engineering principles, operational discipline, and mature automation to our operating environments and the GitLab codebase.

GitLab SREs specialize in systems (operating systems, storage subsystems, networking), while implementing best practices for availability, reliability and scalability, with varied interests in algorithms and distributed systems.

## What youâ€™ll do

  * Design and implement highly scalable infrastructure to support the needs of current and future GitLab.com architecture.
  * Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams and other teams throughout Infrastructure on projects to drive GitLabâ€™s future.
  * Respond to incidents on an on call rotation (our team is distributed globally, so you only are on call during your daytime hours!) and participate in incident review.
  * Act as subject matter experts within the GitLab infrastructure department, specializing in provisioning of multiple isolated GitLab instances and supporting services to have each GitLab instance work in Cluster mode.
  * Automating every operational task is a core requirement for SRE. E.g. package updates, configuration changes across all customer platforms without interruptions, tools for automatic provisioning of customer facing services, deployments of multiple services..
  * Work with backend engineers from inception to production readiness for new distributed services running in multiple regions to allow the scalability and reliability of GitLab.com.

## What youâ€™ll bring

  * Experience with the Kubernetes ecosystem including Helm.
  * Google Cloud Platform expertise, specifically around networking, GKE configuration, and scaling.
  * Experience with Terraform infrastructure as code.
  * Experience with configuration management tools such as Ansible,Chef, Puppet, etc.
  * Experience building systems using Go or Ruby.
  * Ability to clearly define problems and think beyond initial solutions, looking at how to make things better in the future.
  * A drive for automating everything.
  * Ability to be a manager of one and have a strong bias for action.
  * An independent, proactive and self-organized mindset.
  * An ability to clearly communicate asynchronously.
  * Excitement to be doing something different every day from project work to production change requests to emergency response.
  * Knowledge or experience of distributed systems in multiple regions.
  * Experience with building and maintaining SLIs and SLOs
  * Experience being on-call and responding to production incidents.

## About the team

SRE develops, owns, and runs the lifecycle of the future infrastructure for GitLab.com. Running the largest GitLab instance in existence (and in fact, one of the largest single-tenancy open-source SaaS sites on the Internet) means we are constantly faced with unique and rewarding challenges that directly impact our users every day. Our future is all about increasing automation so we can continue to scale even bigger with enterprise level expectations around reliability and availability.
