**About the role:**

We are looking for a Staff Software Engineer based in North America to join our mission to help people learn!

This is a great opportunity to work with an amazing team and drive the technology of learning products and platforms. We operate in a highly collaborative environment with Product and Design to build experiences that matter to our customers.

**About the Team:**

The Engagement team owns our student customer-facing systems, including our digital classroom and learning tools - the experiences that students learn in. If you want to have direct, meaningful impact on our customersâ€™ learning this is the place! You will architect scalable software solutions, understand and implement best practices, and create technology that is highly performant and extensible.
