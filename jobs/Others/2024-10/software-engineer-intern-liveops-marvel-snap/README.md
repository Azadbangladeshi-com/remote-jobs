**Who We Are**

Second Dinner is an award-winning independent game development studio that is here to make the most fun games in the world. Not super fun games. Not SUPER DUPER fun games. We mean the MOST fun games. In fact, our game MARVEL SNAP has earned multiple Mobile Game of the Year Awards (Game Awards, DICE), Best Strategy Game (IGN), and the Apple Design Award for Innovation!

Second Dinner is a remote-first studio, so while we are headquartered in Irvine, California, most of our team is fully remote across the United States. We want the most talented teammates wherever they call home. A diverse team with varied perspectives makes us a better company and will help us make better games. If you can bring something new to the table and expand our point of view, that's a huge upside.

**About the Internship**

While we're still finalizing the specific dates, we are aiming for the internship duration to be approximately 12 to 13 weeks. This role will be fully remote, but if you are local to HQ, there will be opportunities for you to work from the office.

 **Our Engineering Team**

At Second Dinner, we believe that great people in a great work environment will lead us to great games and player experiences. We empower our team to build and innovate with best in class tools in ways they haven't been used before. Our goal is to simplify the game development process and redefine what is possible in game development.
