## **This is Engineering at Lattice**

Latticeâ€™s Engineering team is continuously working to better both our product and our craft. We use a modern, cutting-edge tech stack and love experimenting with new technologies. We strive for maintainable, robust, and performant code. Weâ€™re highly collaborative and continuously iterative and work closely with designers and product managers. We prioritize not only great technical architecture but also an amazing product experience.

## **What You Will Do**

The HRIS Onboarding team owns the Onboarding and Documents domains in our HRIS. The Onboarding product is the entryway into Lattice for new employees, and has significant opportunities over time to make sure that employees starting at a new company have the smoothest onboarding experience and are setup for success. The product enables company admins to ensure all of the employeeâ€™s information is filled out, internal operations are coordinated, and the employee gets key information to get them ramped quickly. The product is integrated with several other domains in the platform today, and there are future opportunities to integrate further across most existing Lattice product domains to make the employeeâ€™s onboarding experience successful both with their new company and with the Lattice product suite itself.
