# **About Aleph**

Aleph is redefining the world of Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A). We operate in an established software category with a multi-billion TAM but no clear winner. We‚Äôre here to change that, and our early results are self-explanatory.

Aleph was founded by Albert Gozzi and Santiago Perez De Rosso, two technical founders with backgrounds from Stanford and MIT and experience working at top-tier companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Bain & Company. We‚Äôre backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Turo, Notion, Zapier, and others.

What we‚Äôve built so far is the most seamless way to centralize all of a company's financial data ‚Äì think expenses from Quickbooks or Netsuite, pipeline forecasts from Salesforce ‚Äì and bring it into the tools finance teams are already using. But the vision goes way beyond that. We‚Äôre building the source of truth for a business‚Äô data, and ultimately the platform businesses use to make better decisions.

We‚Äôre way ahead of schedule due to our unique approach, with barely any churn and rapid growth with very low marketing spend to date.

We are hiring remotely across the Americas (Canada, LATAM, United States).

  * Own the development of new AI features end-to-end, from prototype to implementation in our core product
