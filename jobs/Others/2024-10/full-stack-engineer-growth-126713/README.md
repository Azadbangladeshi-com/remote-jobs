# **Who we are**

## **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

## **About the team**

Our Growth team is on a mission to acquire, convert and grow millions of merchants globally across Stripeâ€™s full suite of financial products. We are a cross functional team of engineers, scientists, marketers, designers and product managers that deliver the insights, algorithms, internal systems and tools, and user-facing experiences that fuel Stripeâ€™s growth. In short we make it easy for people to act on their interest in Stripe.

As part of the Growth Engineering team, you will build and own the systems, products, internal tools, and customer-facing experiences that power intelligence behind our go-to-market and product-led growth. This includes building our ML powered recommendations and growth experimentation engine(s), multi-channel notifications systems, and key growth-related customer experiences (e.g., onboarding experiences, user dashboards, product recommendations).

## **What youâ€™ll do**

### **Responsibilities**

  * Lead the design and development of scalable, ML driven system(s), working with other engineers and scientists to make it easy to run experiments and surface insights as our users navigate Stripe
  * Raise the bar across teams on the mechanisms that result in high-quality, beautiful, and durable dashboard experiences as well as responsive data and backend systems
  * Champion pragmatic solutions and code patterns throughout our codebase, setting standards in React/JavaScript/CSS/GraphQL as well as Ruby APIs and ML systems
  * Scope, design, and lead technical projects, laying the groundwork for early-stage products to iteratively evolve and scale
  * Ensure our backend components are reliable, secure, extensible, and accessible
  * Define operational processes and lead response to production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack, growing the learning and retrospective culture on our team and driving remediations that reduce risk
  * Partner with other leaders across the business to translate ambitious, data-first growth strategies into technical plans

## **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * 5+ years of professional hands-on software development experience
  * Ability to clearly identify business priorities, create new areas of investments, anticipate pitfalls and risks, and deep technical expertise for teams you lead
  * Experience building production frontend web experiences and maintaining the backend APIs that power them (especially APIs built in dynamic languages like Ruby, backed by document or relational datastores like Mongo or MySQL)
  * Experience incorporating observability into production systems and supporting their operation (oncall, incident response)
  * Familiarity with basic analysis in large datasets (especially in systems like Redshift or Presto/Trino)
  * Ability to interact with customers and stakeholders directly in order to better understand their use cases and to brainstorm better ways to solve their problems
  * Deep care for users' needs, and ability to be a steward of crafting great experiences
  * Experience as a generalist, working on both the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users both internally and externally

### **Preferred qualifications**

  * Experience with machine learning, recommender systems, product-led growth, and/or lifecycle marketing
