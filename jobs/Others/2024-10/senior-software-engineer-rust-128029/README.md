### OP Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

The Optimism Collective leads the blockchain protocol landscape, dedicated to fostering a scalable and sustainable ecosystem. Optimismâ€™s ethos, in sync with Ethereum's vision, tackles pivotal coordination challenges of the digital age. Optimismâ€™s goal is to harmonize private incentives with public good, shaping a resilient future for the Internet. Optimismâ€™s scope spans diverse areas like Gaming, DeFi, NFTs, and Enterprise.

OP Labs is looking for an experienced software engineer with Rust expertise. Weâ€™re developing the infrastructure to enable the secure and permissionless withdrawal of funds from OP Stack chains and the Superchain.

Weâ€™re contributing to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem, enabling OP Stack chains to use Reth, and building a rust-based fault proof program to complement the existing Go-based implementation.

We also maintain important Go-based infrastructure, and while we do have Go specialists our values are to put the Optimism mission first and help anywhere thatâ€™s needed.

### What are the role responsibilities?

  * Contribute to important Rust-based Ethereum and OP Stack infrastructure including OP Reth, Kona, and related open-source tools and libraries.
  * Evolve our proof system to meet stage 2 requirements using dispute games and/or validity proofs.
  * Assist in occasional maintenance of existing Go-based infrastructure as needed.
  * Work with other teams and other disciplines within OP Labs, and with our ecosystem of external developers and partners.

### What skills do you bring?

  * A deep understanding of the Rust language and ecosystem.
  * Blockchain development experience.
  * Experience in systems programming, particularly in developing low-level software such as virtual machines, interpreters, or compilers.
  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to document technical details clearly and collaborate effectively with team members.
  * Strong understanding of cryptographic principles.
  * Experience with Zero Knowledge Proofs is a nice-to-have.
