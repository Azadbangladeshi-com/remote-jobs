The Deployment Infrastructure team is looking to hire a Senior Software Engineer with a focus on creating robust, automated, deployment systems that balance reliability and efficiency.

At Reddit, we aim to deploy our services globally. This involves taking release artifacts and ensuring they can be deployed via custom workflows across a variety of compute clusters. We aim to ensure that bad deployments can be automatically detected, rolled back, and minimize impact on our production systems. At the same time, we need to ensure successful deployments can propagate across our infrastructure without human intervention.

Many companies achieve with operations teams that can write scripts and build pipelines. However, at Reddit, our scale and developers demand that we build our own software and integrate capable open-source tooling. This means we are looking for individuals with a strong **software engineering** background to fill this role.

**In your day-to-day, you can expect to:**

  * Work collaboratively with a team of software engineers build and deploy software capable of:
    * Orchestrating complex deployment workflows
    * Progressively rolling out services globally
    * Achieving automated rollback of failed deployments
    * Providing insight and monitoring around the health of deployments
  * Work with our end-users to establish requirements and designs.
  * Integrate open source technologies, largely in the CNCF ecosystem and at times contribute to them to help meet Redditâ€™s business needs.
  * Build end user tooling, for example CLI utilities in Go that help interact with dashboards.
  * Share on-call responsibilities with the deployment infrastructure team.

**You have:**

  * 5+ years of experience working in the infrastructure and/or deployment domain. Specifically with a focus on software engineering (as opposed to systems operations)
    * Language proficiency in either Go (Preferred), Rust, or Python.
  * Experience developing on top of Kubernetes or similar distributed systems.
  * Experience utilizing systems in the continuous delivery domain such as Argo, Flux, Temporal, and similar systems.
  * Strong troubleshooting competency ranging from higher-level orchestration concerns to lower-level runtime ones.
  * Experience designing large systems, scoping work, and building consensus with other engineers.
  * Excellent communication skills to collaborate with a service-oriented team and company.

**Benefits:**

  * Comprehensive Health benefits
  * 401k Matching
  * Workspace benefits for your home office
  * Personal & Professional development funds
  * Family Planning Support
  * Flexible Vacation (please use them!) & Reddit Global Days Off
  * 4+ months paid Parental Leave
  * Paid Volunteer time off
