### **SeatGeek believes live events are powerful experiences that unite humans. With our technological savvy and fan-first attitude weâ€™re simplifying and modernizing the ticketing industry.**

We are looking for a Senior iOS Engineer II to join SeatGeekâ€™s Mobile Foundation team.

People love SeatGeek: we're rated 4.9 stars with over seven hundred thousand reviews. We're constantly improving our user experience, in-app ticketing, and event discovery, but there are many other ambitious projects on our roadmap. SeatGeek makes finding a great ticket easy, but the live event experience does not end there. That's where you come in.

Check out the app in the App Store. If you like what you see, and want to contribute, we'd love to hear from you!

### **What you'll do**

  * Help define what mobile means for an entire industry
  * Continuously improve the application architecture
  * Own the development of new features, from conception, through design and development, to release
  * Partner with, teach, and learn from other iOS engineers and other teams
  * Collaborate with our design team to set new standards for app beauty and usability on iOS

### **What you have**

  * 4+ years of experience building iOS apps and 8+ years in software engineering
  * Comfort programming complex applications in Swift
  * An enjoyment for handling plenty of responsibility and can see large projects to completion
  * Experience developing beautiful, useful apps that are live in the App Store
  * Satisfaction in detailsâ€”we've noticed the best iOS engineers are as obsessed with pixels as they are with view models
  * A care for building something that's used and loved by many
  * Comfort driving architecture decisions and a strong sense of best practices

### Perks

  * Equity stake
  * Flexible work environment, allowing you to work as many days a week in the office as youâ€™d like or 100% remotely
  * A WFH stipend to support your home office setup
  * Unlimited PTO
  * Up to 16 weeks of paid family leave
  * 401(k) matching program
  * Health, vision, dental, and life insurance
  * Up to $25k towards family building services
  * $500 per year for wellness expenses
  * Subscriptions to Headspace (meditation), Headspace Care (therapy), and One Medical

  * Annual subscription to Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon music
