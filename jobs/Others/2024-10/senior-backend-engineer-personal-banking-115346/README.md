# [Senior Backend Engineer - Personal Banking](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-backend-engineer-personal-banking-115346)  
### Mercury  
#### `ðŸŒŽ San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Portland, OR, or Remote within Canada or United States`  

In April, Mercury announced our public beta for Mercury Personal â€“ a premium consumer banking* service offering high-yield savings, free wires, ATM fee reimbursements, and favored Mercury features like User Permissions and Auto-Transfer Rules. We built the product for investors and founders. Individuals who were likely to have heard about Mercury or used it already, who were likely to have strong opinions about UX and get value out of the free wires, who appreciated a technology-first banking experience that didnâ€™t require a phone call to accomplish simple tasks.  
  
Weâ€™ve invited beta users and continue to tweak the product based on their feedback. Weâ€™re ramping up cautiously to ensure adequate risk and compliance controls as we move into this new domain. And, thereâ€™s still a lot to build.

Right now, our team is working on a few table-stakes consumer banking features like Joint Accounts. Weâ€™re interested in building Trust Accounts and enabling several features that already exist for business banking customers like Treasury and sending international wires.

_* Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group; Member FDIC_.

As part of this role, you will:

  * Feel a strong sense of product ownership and actively seek responsibility â€“ we often self-organize on small/medium projects, and we want someone whoâ€™s excited to help shape and build the future of Mercury Personal.
  * Work closely with designers, product leaders, and other engineers to build new features for Mercury Personal and thoughtfully port existing business banking features over.

The ideal candidate for the role:

  * Has 4+ years of software development experience, with a knowledge of or excitement to learn Haskell.
  * Has made architectural decisions in the past and seen the impact of those decisions over time. You should be able to clearly articulate your technical opinions and lay out tradeoffs.
  * Is passionately product-minded and has experience building and shipping new products.
  * Is someone comfortable driving discussions in areas with ambiguous ownership, approaches them with empathy, and delights in getting outcomes. Our work touches many other teams and areas of the product; youâ€™ll have a lot of autonomy and the expectation is youâ€™ll use that to seek out ways to have an impact.
  * Is ridiculously helpful, taking initiative to make your coworkersâ€™ lives easier.

Our salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry.
