## Description

 **Our mission**

  

At Included Health, weâ€™re on a mission to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone. Weâ€™re a new kind of healthcare company, focused on breaking down barriers to provide high-quality care for every person in every community â€” no matter where they are in their health journey or what type of care they need. We offer guidance, advocacy, and access to personalized care for urgent care, primary care, behavioral health, and specialty care. Weâ€™re especially focused on increasing access to high-quality and culturally competent providers that can raise care equity for the LGBTQ+ community, Black Americans and other communities who have been historically disenfranchised and underserved in the US healthcare system.

  

**Our team**

  

What problems have you solved with data? What problems have you helped others solve with data? If you have spent any amount of time turning data into actionable insights you understand that success is conditioned on first finding and fixing the problems with your data and then connecting the data-derived insights to business goals. Achieving this in a timely, repeatable manner is hard. Doing so in a world where data access is highly democratized and users can slice and recombine data in ways you may not have imagined is harder. Successfully turning messy, often unstructured healthcare data into insights and actions which improve well-being and medical outcomes at scale is so hard that it so far has remained elusive.

  

Data Tools owns the suite of tools which gather, clean and conform member medical data and turn that data into insights and metrics. Our tools empower Data Science, Analytics and Product teams to build personalized member recommendations, alert medical providers to potentially undiagnosed health problems, and report on our ability to deliver highest quality medical outcomes in a cost effective manner to our clients among others, all while adhering to the highest data privacy and governance standards.

  

 **You!**

  

Your focus will be on building out our suite of tools to make working with data natural for both data producers and consumers. Your projects could include: Integrating our common data model with open source tools Datahub and Querybook, developing a streaming event framework to allow data produced by our mobile apps to flow into the common data model and implementing data validation concepts into our data ingestion and transformation tools.
