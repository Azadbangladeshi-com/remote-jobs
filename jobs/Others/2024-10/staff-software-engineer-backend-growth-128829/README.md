## Description

 **Our Mission and Opportunity**

Early education is one of the greatest determinants of childhood outcomes, is a must for working families, and has a lasting social and economic impact. Brightwheelâ€™s vision is to enable high quality early education for every child â€” by giving teachers meaningfully more time with students each day, engaging parents in the development of their kids, and supporting the small businesses that make up the backbone of the $175 billion early education market. Brightwheel is the most loved technology brand in early education globally, trusted by thousands of educators and millions of families.

  

 **Our Team**

We are a fully remote team with employees across every time zone in the US. Our team is passionate, talented, and customer-focused. Our exceptional investor group includes Addition, Bessemer Venture Partners, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GGV Capital, Lowercase Capital, Emerson Collective, and Mark Cuban.

  

We believe that everyoneâ€”from our employees to the students, teachers, and administrators we serveâ€” should be given the opportunity to learn and thrive, whatever their background may be. We celebrate diversity in all forms because it allows our team and the communities we serve to reach their full potential and do their best work. From decision making, to how we operate, we ground ourselves in our Leadership Principles every day.

  

**Who you are**

  

We are seeking a staff software engineer who is well-rounded technically and passionate about the positive impact their code can make in peopleâ€™s lives. Our School Operations team is focused on enabling the best day-to-day product experience possible. Early childhood educators are terribly short on time: the easier it is for them to take care of routine tasks, like tracking student attendance, logging activities, and communicating with parents, the more time they have to focus on engaging directly with the children they care for. At brightwheel, product engineers work closely with product and design, as well as with other areas of the business, to define and deliver an experience that meets our customers' biggest needs.

  

Every engineer at brightwheel is afforded a high degree of ownership and autonomy. We are a lean, fast-moving team and value individuals who can optimize for being impactful while considering both technical and business drivers. Youâ€™ll bring a high degree of ownership and ability to execute.
