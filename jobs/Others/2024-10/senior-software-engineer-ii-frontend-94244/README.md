As a **Senior Software Engineer II** , youâ€™ll have the opportunity to drive our product forward, refining and evolving the features our customers love while pushing new directions. Youâ€™ll shape key frontend components, including design systems, state management patterns, and overall architecture. Affinityâ€™s user experiences are data-dense and highly interactive, offering a challenging and rewarding role with significant impact.

**In this role, you will:**

  * Work with a cross-functional group leading the frontend engineering projects from design to delivery, ensuring successful execution and outcomes.

  * Mentor other engineers, providing technical guidance, conducting code reviews, and improving team practices.
  * Drive operational excellence, influencing decisions that enhance the scalability and maintainability of our frontend systems.

**Qualifications:**

Donâ€™t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every qualification. At Affinity, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace, so if youâ€™re excited about this role, but your past experience doesnâ€™t perfectly align with the qualifications above, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

  * You have ~7+ years of experience as a software engineer, with a focus on frontend development, and at least 2+ years in a senior role leading team projects.
  * You are an expert in React and TypeScript.
  * You have experience with performance optimization techniques and tools to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions.
  * You have expertise with frontend build tools and package managers (Eg. webpack, pnpm)
  * You demonstrate strong ownership instincts, guiding the design, planning, and execution of large, complex projects.
  * You have strong leadership abilities and experience mentoring other engineers and providing technical guidance.

**Nice to have:**

  * You have a combination of startup and brand-name SaaS companies experience.
  * You have experience writing server-side code leveraging modern OOP practices using Ruby, Rails and PostgreSQL.

**Tech stack:**

Our platform is built with React and TypeScript on the front end, with Ruby and PostgreSQL on the back end. Weâ€™re leaning into event-driven architecture using Kafka. Our infrastructure is hosted by AWS and runs on Kubernetes.
