## Description

 **About the Company**

  

Hi, we're Ondo Finance. Our mission is to provide institutional-grade, blockchain-enabled investment products and services. We have both a technology arm that develops decentralized finance technology, and an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized funds. We were the first company to tokenize exposure to US Treasuries, and have since expanded into several other assets. We are also focused on incubating protocols that can support both tokenized real-world assets and traditional crypto.

  

Founded by folks from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets Team, we‚Äôre backed by some of the best investors in the world including Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global, and more. We are currently the leaders in the space in terms of AUM and are well capitalized to continue growing the firm. We're fully remote, with team members across the U.S.

  

 **About the Role**

  

As a Smart Contract Engineer at Ondo, you will be at the forefront of developing and optimizing smart contracts that power Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. You will design and implement secure, efficient, and scalable smart contract solutions across many blockchain ecosystems.

  

In this role, you will collaborate with cross-functional teams, including product, legal, and compliance, to ensure the contracts are not only technically sound but also aligned with regulatory standards. You‚Äôll tackle complex challenges around asset tokenization, security, novel token bridging solutions, novel DeFi protocols, and DeFi interoperability.

  

You will play a pivotal role in expanding Ondo‚Äôs suite of products and paving the way for large-scale blockchain adoption by traditional financial institutions.

  

This is a unique opportunity to help shape the future of finance by creating smart contract solutions that bring real-world assets on-chain, driving innovation and transforming financial markets.
