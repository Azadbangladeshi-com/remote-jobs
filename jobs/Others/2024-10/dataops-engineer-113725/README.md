## Description

 **WHO WE ARE**

The Trustly Americas team combines PayWithMyBank, a 2012 Silicon Valley startup, with Trustly AB of Sweden, following their 2019 merger. Our team represents 30 nationalities, serving 9,000 merchants, connecting to 650 million consumers, and 12,000 banks across 33 countries. Our global network processes over $100 billion annually.

  

We are the leader in Open Banking Payments, and weâ€™re on a mission to give merchants and consumers a better payment experience through Pay by Bank. For merchants, we deliver payment acceptance at a significantly lower cost than cards. For consumers, we enable them to use their bank accounts at payment methods instead of being held captive by high-interest cards. And it all happens through the security of Open Banking, only with Trustly.

  

With offices in Vitoria, Brazil, Silicon Valley in the US, and global headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, we are a culturally diverse team. Across Brazil, we have embraced remote work from home policy.

  

At Trustly, we believe that inclusion and diversity are essential foundations for building a fair and equitable society. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, ancestry, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, or disability status. Our main goal is to provide a fair, welcoming, diverse environment with opportunities for all collaborators. The stages of our selection process take place online and without distinction of any kind.

  

Itâ€™s a great time to join Trustly as the Americas team is growing fast. If you thrive in an entrepreneurially-minded, fast-paced, casual, professional, positive, and rewarding work environment, check us out!

  

 **About the team**

Trustly's DataOps team is responsible for delivering the data generated by the application to interested areas, as well as data from APIs and other tools. All this thought in a safe, structured, scalable and generic way, because we work with multiple environments (in different regions) and we need to maintain consistency. We work with both the batch layer (using Airflow) and the streaming layer (Kafka). We help areas in process automation to deliver data more quickly and reliably. We are also concerned with the quality of the data (Data Quality), creating an observability layer for the data to act in a preventive and immediate way to the inconsistencies and failures of our processes. We also work on the delivery of products and services to facilitate the use and consultation of our data, such as maintaining tools such as Debezium and Quicksight. Last but not least, we interacted with the Data Science area to provide the necessary support and infrastructure for the production of models.
To achieve our goals, we follow good code and development practices, apply end-to-end encryption in all our processes, use infrastructure as code, etc.
