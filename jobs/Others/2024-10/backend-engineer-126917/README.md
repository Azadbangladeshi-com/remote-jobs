We serve our customers through a web app built with React, TypeScript, Webpack, NextJS, and other technologies, which communicates with a REST API built with Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and Redis. We are currently evaluating building parts of our applications using the latest Ruby on Rails frontend technologies such as Hotwire, Turbo and Stimulus. We use GitHub for version control and code reviews, Semaphore and Github Actions for CI/CD, Rollbar for production error tracking, and rely on Heroku for infrastructure management. If you're ready to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact, weâ€™d love to hear from you!

  * **Collaborate Across Teams** : Work closely with engineering, product, and design teams to innovate and ensure the timely completion of tasks.
  * **Foster Cross-Functional Collaboration** : Engage with other departments, such as marketing, sales, and customer success, to understand their needs and incorporate their feedback into the product development process.

  * Excellent verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. Fluency in English, both written and spoken, to succeed in our remote, partly asynchronous work environment.
