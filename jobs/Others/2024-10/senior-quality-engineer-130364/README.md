**THE ROLE**

As a Senior Quality Engineer at Khan Academy, you will ensure the quality and reliability of our web-based products used by schools and learners to improve educational outcomes.

You will:

  * Own manual test plan development and execution for new features on the team.
  * Build and maintain new test automation to fill coverage gaps using insights from manual testing, stakeholder priorities, and industry best practices.
  * Collaborate with cross-functional partners throughout the SDLC, including planning, design reviews, and development discussions to ensure quality is considered from the beginning.
  * Use your creativity and extensive knowledge of testing tools and frameworks to find, document, and track bugs.
