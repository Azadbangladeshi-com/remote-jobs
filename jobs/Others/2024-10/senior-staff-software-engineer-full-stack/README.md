### None  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote US`  

At Eppo, we are building the future of experimentation, so that every company can have an entrepreneurial, customer oriented culture. We believe that AB experiments uniquely put customers at the center of product decisions instead of political processes.

Our next-gen platform allows companies to 10x their volume of AB experiments by embracing the full technical rigor of engineering and statistics while focusing intensely on the evangelism of results and accessibility to business users. We are built for the modern cloud infrastructure, with easy integrations and an emphasis on privacy and security.

Our team is made up of veteran product builders from Airbnb, Slack, and Snowflake, and our product is powering experimentation at some of top companies around the world. Weâ€™ve raised over $47M funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Innovation Endeavors, Icon Ventures, Menlo VC, and Amplify Partners. See our Series B announcement here.

# About the Role

We are hiring a full stack engineer who can work with our Typescript/NextJS foundation to help our customers collaborate on and manage experiments, run the data computations required, and report the results in a way that scales across the organization. We've already built a flexible data computation engine and have invested heavily in designing a novel experience for experimentation, and we need a full stack engineer to bring these pieces together into a world class application.

## Your Background

Concretely, we are looking for this combination of attributes and skills:

### Attributes

  * Business owner mindset: you are comfortable making choices in ambiguous situations, and think of the team's success and failure as your own

  * Bias to action: You have a drive to move forward, and are comfortable using placeholders, straw men, and other temporary solutions when necessary. You resolve ambiguity by action.

  * Resourceful: The set of technologies and frameworks to use for application building evolves every day. We want to use every tool to accelerate our business, whether it is an open source project, a serverless component, or an external engineer.

### Skills

  * Able to build using Typescript/NextJS with high quality and velocity

  * Able to build reuseable data visualization components

  * Able to architect data models needed to build systems in mockups

### Compensation

  * Competitive senior engineer salary and early stage equity

  * Top of the line health, dental, and vision insurance

  * New laptop/equipment of your choice and whatever else you need to be productive

  * Compensation for learning materials, tools and resources to help you learn and grow

The typical compensation for this role ranges from $180,000-$220,000. At Eppo, we are dedicated to building an equitable and inclusive workspace, while encouraging entrepreneurship and growth.
