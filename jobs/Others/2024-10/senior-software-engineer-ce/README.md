### Amperon  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

## **The Company Youâ€™ll Join**

Amperon is the leading analytics and forecasting company for the energy transition. Our platform leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to accurately forecast energy demand on both the supply (power & utilities companies) and demand (large energy users) sides of the market. We incorporate real-time data feeds that help our clients reduce cost, monitor energy efficiency while increasing substantially.

We bring the brightest mind from energy, security and technology in order to combat climate changes and transition to clean energy solutions. We have offices in Texas but are a remote first company.

## **Our Strategy**

Amperon operates at the intersection of energy data, AI, and domain expertise to empower the world to navigate the energy transition more effectively. Using best-in-class data ingestion and management infrastructure, coherent AI/ML models, and leading-edge predictive analytics, Amperon provides tools that generate economic and societal value.

Amperon seeks to modernize the grid data and AI software stack to improve reliability, optimize asset economics, and accelerate decarbonization for grid operators, asset owners, and end-users. We're building the next generation of market-leading energy analytics and forecasting products, and we want you to be part of our journey!

## **The team youâ€™ll work with**

The Customer Engineering (CEN) Team operates within the greater Amperon product framework to develop software and processes that center individual customers and their success. We execute customer-specific work such as deployments and custom reporting, we create monitoring tools and alerts that give product and engineering a pro-active understanding of how our product is serving our customers, and we build tools that simplify deployment so that we can scale more easily. We are a newly formed team so this individual will have the opportunity to drive tooling and infrastructure adaptation.

## **The Impact**

We empower our fellow teams in engineering, science, customer success and sales to move faster and do better work, accelerating revenue and company growth. Our work also directly helps the company scale by increasing the number and breadth of customers our product can support.

## **The challenges youâ€™ll work on **

This requires that we be excellent at software design, engineering best practices, and technical communication. Some of the challenges we tackle include:

  * Automating new deployments across all customer types
  * Improving customer configuration architecture in the product
  * Developing internal apps including monitoring customer health and prediction accuracy
  * Implementing dashboarding platforms for internal and external use
  * Creating tooling for delivering custom reports to customers

## **You may be a fit for this role if**

Senior level engineering experience with a focus on data driven SaaS products, software design, and engineering best practices, Strong experience with Python and SQL databases. Experience with cloud computing and distributed systems. Experience collaborating with other engineering teams, especially those with a focus on data analytics. Proven understanding how technical decisions impact the users of what we are building. Experience with front-end languages is a plus.

**Benefits and Perks**

While we are serious about our company's culture, we aren't going to force "culture" to prove that we are cool and fun. Itâ€™s a company filled with smart, genuinely nice individuals who are passionate about data science, energy and working together to build a product that can have a lasting impact on our planet.

Even though we are a remote company with employees spread across the globe, we still believe human interaction is a good thing. We will also have an all-company event at least once a year so people can get to know each other in a more fun and social way.
