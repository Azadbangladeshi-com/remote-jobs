# [Software Engineer II, Backend (Identity Foundations)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-ii-backend-identity-foundations)  
### Affirm  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote US`  

The Identity Foundations team is a critical service group within the Trust and Safety domain, responsible for building sophisticated data layers and interfaces that manage essential user data. The team currently supports numerous RPCs, which are integral to the checkout process and are relied upon by nearly all cross-functional engineering teams at Affirm. The business uses Identity data to verify a consumerâ€™s Identity for compliance reasons, also known as Know Your Customer (KYC). Identity data includes PII like Name, Address, Date of Birth, and Social Security Number (in the US). Identity uses this data to find a 3rd party data source, typically a credit report, to confirm that the data is accurate. This happens both at consumer sign up, as well as throughout the consumer lifecycle as a returning consumer.

At Affirm, we've defined a new domain that encapsulates core capabilities of Trust and Safety services (Authentication, Identity, Fraud, etc.) called **Consumer Identity Safeguard Domain**. Identity Engineering will need to rewrite relevant systems to satisfy both the business and architectural requirements for **Consumer Identity Domain** in the next few years.

  * Provide technical leadership in a particular area and actively contribute to technical discussions.
  * Work with and guide engineers on detailed project definition, design, technical specification, cross-functional alignment, task break-down, delivery, monitoring, and maintenance.
  * Build relationships and drive coordination across engineering, partner organizations, and other disciplines, helping get to positive outcomes.

  * Mentor less-experienced members of team by helping them with code review, setting up best coding practices , providing guidance, and setting a good example.
