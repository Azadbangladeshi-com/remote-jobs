### OP Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote, Global`  

Are you ready to help shape the future of Ethereum and the multichain world? At OP Labs, weâ€™re at the forefront of scaling Ethereum through the OP Stack, introducing groundbreaking features like interoperability and multichain applications. As part of our Developer Experience (DevX) team, you'll have the unique opportunity to lead this transformation by building and advocating for tools that make multichain development seamless and accessible.

In this role, you wonâ€™t just be working with tools like Forge, Viem, and Anvilâ€”youâ€™ll be at the cutting edge of new paradigms, tinkering with the latest technologies, collaborating with top developers in the ecosystem, and guiding them to unlock new possibilities. Youâ€™ll be the bridge between our dev tools and the builder community, gathering feedback and using your expertise to directly influence the next generation of decentralized applications.

If you're passionate about building in the open, thrive on tinkering with new technologies, and love being an active voice in the developer community, we'd love to hear from you!

### What are the role responsibilities?

**Your north star is to drive app developers to the Superchain via several workflows:**

  * **Build and maintain example applications:** Create and maintain comprehensive example applications and documentation that showcases the potential of our developer tools.
  * **Evangelism:** Advocate for our tools by creating technical content (blogs, social media posts, videos), presenting at conferences, and participating in livestreams and hackathons.
  * **Community engagement:** Interact with the developer community to gather feedback and share it internally to help drive product enhancements.
  * **Tool improvement:** Actively contribute to the improvement of developer tools by making pull requests and suggesting feature enhancements based on user feedback.
  * **Internal collaboration:** Work closely with engineering, product, and marketing teams to align on messaging and ensure our tools are developer friendly.
  * **Open source contributions:** Engage in open source efforts where applicable, promoting best practices for developer experience.

### What skills do you bring?

  * Strong background in software engineering with experience building developer tools and/or blockchain applications.
  * Comfort with Solidity is important, and knowledge or willingness to learn Golang would be helpful.
  * Strong familiarity with Git, Github workflows, and making pull requests.
  * History of contribution to open source projects.
  * A deep interest in improving tools for developers and making the development process easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. Empathy for the developer experience and unending curiosity about their needs.
  * Ability to explain technical concepts clearly through both written content and presentations. Comfortable presenting at conferences and other public forums.
  * Proven experience in creating technical content such as blogs, tutorials, and demos. Ideally you drove adoption of a tool, library, or other technology in a previous role.
