If you hear the word iPaaS and think of Apple products, potentially a new kind of Mac beer, then maybe you shouldn't continue reading. However, if you're thinking of integration platforms as a service, you passed the test! We have the ideal position for you.

We're on the hunt for a Senior Mulesoft Developer for a client who's killing it in the datacenter and cloud services sphere. You'll be joining a small team of under 10 people, and you'll be the leading expert on integrations. Your daily tasks will include integration design, development and testing, as well as issue troubleshooting, API specs, and collaborating with other teams. Internal stakeholders will be your new best friends, since you'll have to understand their requirements in order to produce timely and effective integration solutions. You'll also help set the bar for integration processes and quality, and you'll run peer reviews to check others' integrations against your standards.

The team has daly standups and they work in 2-week sprints. They're highly collaborative and ready to jump on a Zoom call whenever help is needed - but ultimately, this is a self-sufficient kind of role. The work environment is playful and friendly, and when they're not busy making each other laugh, this is what your sprints will entail:

  * Working on data integration and synchronization across financial and CRM systems
  * Developing event-based notifications in RabbitMQ to trigger API/SQL data actions with subscribers/listeners
  * Third-party service integrations via API creation
  * Running unit and integration tests on your deliverables

Experience and knowledge you need to succeed:

  * 5+ years working with MuleSoft
  * 3+ years integrating with NetSuite
  * RESTful web services
  * Impeccable problem-solving and debugging skills
  * Great communication and team-player attitude
  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * API design and development
  * Backend web development/programming
  * Writing unit tests/automated QA

Experience with the following will also be useful:

  * MSSQL database: view, stored procedure, and ITVF creation and optimization.
  * RabbitMQ or similar
  * Certifications or experience in database management, cloud technologies, or enterprise integration patterns
  * Docker/Kubernetes
  * Salesforce, or Epicor integrations
  * Jenkins
  * Gitlab
  * Team lead roles, or an interest in being team lead in the short term
