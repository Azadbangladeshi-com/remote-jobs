## Description

 **About Us**

Circle is building the world‚Äôs leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments ‚Äî all in one place, all under their own brand.

  

We‚Äôre proud to be a fully remote company of around 170 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours, but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to document a lot.

  

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in beautiful places around the world for our company offsites. So far, we‚Äôve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico, Thailand, Colombia, and Italy, with more to come!

  

 **About the role**

We‚Äôre looking for a Lead Growth Engineer to supercharge our product‚Äôs growth by crafting data-driven experiments that directly impact user acquisition, increase MRR, reduce churn, and support all go-to-market functions. Whether you‚Äôre optimizing onboarding flows to boost sign-ups, refining billing infrastructure with our payment providers to enhance subscription models, or building internal tools for the sales team, you‚Äôll be at the forefront of our growth strategy. You'll work closely with Sales to identify friction points and improve conversion paths, and with a global team of two senior engineers and a product leader who brings years of experience growing products. This is a hands-on, cross-functional role where you'll drive key decisions, collaborate closely with marketing, sales, and internal teams, and turn insights into impactful actions that help us scale Circle.

  

This year, our growth team has already driven significant expansion revenue through subscription upgrade paths, enhanced our billing infrastructure to support geographic expansion and new product launches, rebuilt our marketing attribution flows, and redesigned our onboarding experience for our recent Circle 3.0 launch. If this sounds exciting to you, we‚Äôd love to chat!
