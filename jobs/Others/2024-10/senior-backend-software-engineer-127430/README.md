## **About engineering at Headway**

Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide. The engineering team at Headway is a small but mighty team using technology to build that future (and have a fun time while doing it!).

### Principles that guide us:

  * **Focus on the mission** : We view software as a means of effecting change in the world, not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapists to better solve the problems theyâ€™re facing. 
  * **Ship small, learn fast** : We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration
  * **Everything is a product** : Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.
  * **Optimize for trust** : We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.

### Tools we use:

  * **Languages** : Python 3
  * **Libraries** : FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React
  * **Datastores** : Postgres, Redis
  * **Infrastructure** : AWS (Fargate, ECS, S3, and more), Spark and Kafka
  * **Monitoring** : Datadog, PagerDuty
  * **Version control** : Github

### Projects weâ€™re working on:

There is a lot that we're building at Headway, but here are a few projects to give you an idea of the problems we're tackling.

  * **Financial Processing and Bookkeeping:** One way to think about Headway is that we help thousands of independent providers operate a small practice. Having detailed and accurate financial systems is critical to their success. Their livelihood depends on us and as their trusted partner, we take that seriously.
  * **Claims Management and Insurance Processing:** We make a guarantee to patients when they seek care that they will have a predictable cost with us. We make a guarantee with providers that they will have easy insurance operations. Meanwhile, Headway processes hundreds of thousands of claims monthly across all states, all major insurance networks and governmental programs. Our systems must be up to the task.Internal Tooling Platform: In healthcare there is always a human component. Engineers build internal tools for multiple non-technical teams and need a scalable, quality platform to deliver them. This platform supports tools for our CX team who is interfacing directly with patients and providers, our ops team who is dealing with claims denials and escalations, and our medical team who is dealing with care quality.
  * **Therapist practice management** : Building a best-in-class platform for Headway therapists to manage their patients, appointments, payments, and more.
  * **Patient search and matching** : Transforming the therapist search experience and becoming the trusted guide for patients to find the right therapist.
