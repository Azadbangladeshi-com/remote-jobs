JumpCloud has been used by more than 200,000 organizations, including GoFundMe, Grab, ClassPass, Beyond Finance, and Foursquare.

 **About the Organization:**

  

Our Device Management organization is changing the way IT admins and users securely use their devices to get work done. Our unique development approach brings fast-paced SaaS methodologies to a traditionally stagnant and slow moving environment. Our Go agent running on customer laptops evolves quickly (weekly releases!?!) and gives IT admins instant access to thousands of data points about their heterogeneous environment. We believe giving admins a secure platform for their users enables our customers to move fast, stay secure, and save time. Our Device Management team is at the heart of this vision. Come join us!

  

 **About the Role:**

  

We‚Äôre looking for senior software engineers to be the next members of our growing Device Management teams. Depending on your aptitude and abilities, you‚Äôll be working with the full technology stack, all the way from operating systems internals to SaaS front-end code. We're using the latest and greatest technologies like GoLang, Node, Docker, ELK Stack, Redis, and more.

  

Haven‚Äôt used those technologies? No worries: we believe that good engineering is not technology specific.

  

We have roles open on teams focusing on both Windows and Linux and are excited to speak to candidates with experience delivering software solutions on either platform.

  

 **The Problems you‚Äôll be solving‚Ä¶**

  

As a key part of our devices management engineering team you‚Äôll lead developing features that enable JumpCloud devices management to secure and authenticate across environments with heterogeneous operating systems. Continuous improvement is a core value at JumpCloud. We challenge every member of our team to be 1% better everyday.
