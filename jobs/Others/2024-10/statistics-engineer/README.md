### None  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote US`  

At Eppo, we are building the future of experimentation, so that every company can have an entrepreneurial, customer oriented culture. We believe that AB experiments uniquely put customers at the center of product decisions instead of political processes.

Our next-gen platform allows companies to 10x their volume of AB experiments by embracing the full technical rigor of engineering and statistics while focusing intensely on the evangelism of results and accessibility to business users. We are built for the modern cloud infrastructure, with easy integrations and an emphasis on privacy and security.

Our team is made up of veteran product builders from Airbnb, Slack, and Snowflake, and our product is powering experimentation at some of top companies around the world. Weâ€™ve raised over $47M funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Innovation Endeavors, Icon Ventures, Menlo VC, and Amplify Partners. See our Series B announcement here.

    * Constant learner: You are always learning new techniques, and are unafraid to learn about tools and problems that donâ€™t traditionally fit in your profile

  *  **Skills**

    * Able to implement probabilistic techniques into a reusable statistical libraries, including bootstrapping, statistical tests, and ML models / regressions

    * Can build data engineering pipelines to gather the necessary data inputs (sufficient statistics) for statistical techniques

    * Can architect APIs that enable other engineers to incorporate statistical techniques in front-end interfaces
