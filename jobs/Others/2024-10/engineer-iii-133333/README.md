About Ashby

We’re building the next generation of enterprise software and we’re starting with a suite of products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run their hiring process significantly better (we haven’t shared much publicly about what we’re building yet, but we’ll be more specific once we meet).

We are well funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom.

cmd.ex

We have not launched publicly yet, but we're already working with amazing companies, such as Opendoor, Plaid, Airtable, Snyk, Benchling and SalesLoft (and many others which we cannot name yet).

We have a clear buyer persona and target market. Our current sales process allows us to land & expand. We've only taken the first step towards a much larger opportunity. In short, it's the perfect time to join 🚀

About this Role

As our first sales hire you will help us transition from founder led sales into a scalable & repeating sales process. Our emphasis is less on previous experience and more on your raw ability to excel in the areas listed below and your appetite for continuous growth & improvement.

We have built an excellent product & engineering machine and we now want to do the same on the go-to-market side.

You could be a great fit if

🤓You love becoming a product and domain expert. You sell consultative and teach prospects something at every touch point.

🔍You pay a lot of attention to detail. You take pride in a clean sales pipeline. You obsess over sending perfect follow up emails on time.

⚡️You move fast. You constantly find areas of improvement. You leverage tools/technology to allow our sales team to scale well.

👷‍♀️You love building a sales process from the ground up.

⚙️You are not only excited about closing deals, but also putting a repeatable process in place that will allow our go-to-market team to excel in future.

🎧You treat sales as a listening exercise and continuously bring learnings about the market, our product, industry trends, etc. back to the overall company.

📊You are analytical and good with numbers, you can model out scenarios without requiring the help of an analyst.

Bonus

👨‍👨‍👧‍👧You have experience hiring & leading a sales team

📢You can tell Ashby's story in way that resonates

🛰You have experience selling complex products

Our Philosophy

Here are a few key points (relevant to the go-to-market side) that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us:

We spend a lot of time building best-in-class products since we believe a highly differentiated product is a lot easier to sell.

We want to offer deep expertise whenever we interact with prospects and customers.

We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people (and the right work environment) deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. We hire and compensate accordingly.

We value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication (we put a lot of effort into using the right communication channels) - we’ll get into these and other values during the hiring process.

Benefits

You’ll get the time to do things the right way; we put a lot of emphasis on high quality work and avoid quick hacks as much as possible

You get to sell a product that our prospects & customers are truly excited about

Competitive compensation

Top notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us

401(k) matching if you're in the US
