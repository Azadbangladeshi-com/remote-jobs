### Ondo Finance  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Remote (US)`  

## Description

 **About the Company**

  

Hi, we're Ondo Finance. Our mission is to provide institutional-grade, blockchain-enabled investment products and services. We have both a technology arm that develops decentralized finance technology, and an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized funds. We were the first company to tokenize exposure to US Treasuries, and have since expanded into several other assets. We are also focused on incubating protocols that can support both tokenized real-world assets and traditional crypto.

  

Founded by folks from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets Team, weâ€™re backed by some of the best investors in the world including Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global, and more. We are currently the leaders in the space in terms of AUM and are well capitalized to continue growing the firm. We're fully remote, with team members across the U.S.

  

 **About the Role**

  

Ondo is looking for an experienced Staff Security Engineer. You will be someone with experience working at a fast moving crypto organization, that is able to demonstrate strong expertise in blockchain, web app and cloud security.

  

As our first dedicated security engineering hire, you will have tons of ownership from day 1 and a clear path to progress within the organization, building out our security programs from the ground up.

  

If you are equally passionate about DeFi and cybersecurity, this could be a great opportunity to apply for.

â€¢Deep networking experience (Firewalls, VPNs, load balancing, networking protocols, Wireshark, etc).

â€¢Experience with modern security tooling (BurpSuite, Metasploit, etc).

â€¢An understanding of modern bridging fundamentals and interoperability protocols.

â€¢A deep understanding of multisignature technology and cold storage (Fireblocks, Gnosis Safe, etc).

â€¢Experience building secure CI/CD systems, particularly for smart contract deployments.

  

 **What we offer:**

  

â€¢Competitive compensation including salary, future token rights, and/or equity (according to your preferences) â€” we're well-funded and believe that great talent deserves great compensation.

â€¢Full benefits (medical, vision, and dental) and flexible vacation policy (PTO).

â€¢Small remote-first team across many countries â€” you'll be an early team member helping shape our vision, culture, and design practices.

â€¢A+ colleagues â€” our team includes alumni from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets, SpaceX, AWS, DeFi protocols like BadgerDAO, private equity funds, hedge funds, and various VC-backed startups.
