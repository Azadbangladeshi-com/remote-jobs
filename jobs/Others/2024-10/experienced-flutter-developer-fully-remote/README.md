## Description

ViaBill operates at the intersection of the eCommerce, payments and consumer credit sectors, and is an industry pioneer and early market entrant in the BNPL industry, which is experiencing rapid growth. Becoming the best at something isnâ€™t easy. It takes skill, hard work, and an unmatched level of ambition and determination. Our team is international, experienced and most of all, hardworking. In just a few years, weâ€™ve grown from our first office in an art gallery in Denmark to having our teams located all over the globe.

  

From a handful of customers to handling transactions worth more than $150M per year, we arenâ€™t afraid of new challenges and new markets. Our strategy has been validated with external investment from leading VCâ€™s Headline and BlackFin Capital Partners.

As we take our business to the next level, ViaBill is looking to hire a motivated Flutter Developer to expand our tech, processes, and client applications. You will be driving the main development efforts on our mobile payments application made with Flutter and build production-ready plugins to Android and iOS.

 **About our team:**

We are a team of highly motivated developers who work remotely from our own offices. We collaborate much like open-source projects with core maintainers for our services. Each developer has a lot of freedom working in a flat hierarchy in a very streamlined process where the domain experts are easily available on Slack or via Meet. We work with a very rapid release schedule, often releasing multiple times per day. This gives us a quick and motivating feedback loop. This also makes it very easy for a developer to see their effect on business! This allows us to experiment and adopt new trends/frameworks quickly.

  

Meet our Developers!
