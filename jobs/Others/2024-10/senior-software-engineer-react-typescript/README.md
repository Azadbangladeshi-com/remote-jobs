**The Role:**

Backstage is seeking a remote Senior Frontend Engineer to join our passionate web team. Our frontend web team consists of six engineers, and includes mid and senior level engineers, a tech lead, and an engineering manager. This team is a part of Backstageâ€™s larger product and engineering department, which numbers approximately thirty high-performance engineers, designers, product managers, analysts, and quality assurance resources. We value curiosity, trust, and impact, and we foster a culture of constant learning and improvement where teammates work together to accomplish user-focused initiatives.

Our process is a modified Kanban process with the goal of delivering incremental value to the customer. Products are workshopped and then broken into milestones, with estimates driven by engineers, not managers. We uphold autonomy and trust our engineers to pick the best tools suited for their tasks, while working collaboratively towards mutual goals. In line with our goal to continue delivering value to the customer, we release multiple times a day, every day, and adhere to a robust QA and code review process before any code is released.

As a Senior Frontend Engineer, you will be working with cutting edge technology and new product development in a stable and rapidly growing company. This is an individual contributor role, and you will be empowered to make your own decisions about implementations and given autonomy to complete your work at your own pace.

The Senior Frontend Engineer will report to the Frontend Director of Engineering

**What Youâ€™ll Do:**

  * Partner with product, marketing, business intelligence, and design teams to create beautiful, usable interfaces for desktop and mobile web 
  * Design engineering plans to meet the requirements of the product or goal
  * Leverage a modern tech stack, including TypeScript and React, to build complex web applications
  * Contribute to and influence the overall frontend architecture decisions
  * Work closely with product, marketing, and customer service to translate customer feedback into successful features and tools 
  * Collaborate with front-end engineers outside your feature team to maintain shared code and front-end infrastructure
  * Coordinate with back-end engineers to provide a cohesive experience

**What weâ€™re looking for from you:**

  * Proven experience building a major product or feature from scratch at scale for a large public-facing web application 
  * Advanced proficiency with Typescript and React
  * Proficient with CSS. Experience with TailwindCSS is a plus.
  * Deep understanding of various state management and data fetching approaches in the React ecosystem.
  * Knowledgeable of the trade-offs of different rendering techniques (server-side-rendering, static-site-generation, client-side rendering)
  * Familiarity with common front-end build tools such as Webpack and Vite
  * Experience incrementally rolling out new features, components or refactors without blocking the rest of the team, and iterating upon and maintaining live products
  * Strong project management skills; able to organize, adhere to process, and execute projects across disciplines and by deadline
  * Excellent communication skills; you can articulate clearly, thoroughly, and concisely to technical and non-technical audiences
  * Comfortability with the entire development life cycle (inception to release) in an Agile environment
  * Collaborative, engaged, and adaptable; you are comfortable joining a team with a large, mature codebase with established engineering processes
  * Flexible and proactive, youâ€™re able to shift gears quickly in a fast-paced environment
  * Familiarity with Python and/or Django a plus
