## Description

 **Senior Site Reliability Engineer**

  

As a Senior Site Reliability Engineer within the SRE Cloud Space team, you will be at the forefront of developing and maintaining advanced observability solutions. This role focuses on enhancing blackbox and whitebox monitoring, implementing synthetic tests, and improving platform reliability across both on-premise and GCP environments, utilizing a variety of cutting-edge technologies.

  

 **Responsibilities**

  

*Blackbox Monitoring and Health Mesh Development: Lead efforts in blackbox monitoring, including the development and enhancement of the Health Mesh product. Implement and manage synthetic tests that monitor critical platform services, providing early detection of incidents. Utilize Prometheus for blackbox monitoring and develop simple Go APIs to support these activities.

*Whitebox Monitoring with SLO Approach: Implement whitebox monitoring strategies with a focus on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for core Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and applications on OpenShift. Ensure that both platform operators and customers have clear visibility into the system's performance and health.

*Anomaly Detection: Develop and refine anomaly detection mechanisms using the same metrics applied in whitebox monitoring. Leverage tools such as Prometheus and Dynatrace to identify and address potential issues before they escalate, contributing to overall platform stability.

*Separation of Platform Incidents from User Errors: Create tools and processes that help operators distinguish between platform-level incidents and individual user errors. This includes enhancing the observability of API gateways and other critical infrastructure components.

*Support for On-Premise and GCP Environments: Maintain and improve observability tools that support both on-premise and cloud environments, ensuring seamless operation across different infrastructure setups. Provide application support for on-premise applications and utilize technologies such as OpenShift for managing on-premise environments

*Collaboration and Incident Management: Collaborate with various teams to ensure effective incident management and response. Focus on separating platform incidents from individual application teams, providing clear communication and resolution strategies.

  

 **Technical Requirements**

  

*Education: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent experience.

*DevOps & SRE Experience: +3 years of experience in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering, with a focus on automation, infrastructure as code, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.

*Programming Experience: 3+ years of experience in programming, with a strong focus on Golang development.

*Monitoring Tools Expertise: 3+ years of experience with APM and monitoring tools such as Dynatrace, Prometheus, ELK, Splunk, or similar.

*Cloud and On-Premise Proficiency: Proficiency in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and experience with on-premise environments, particularly with application deployment and management on OpenShift.

*Container Orchestration: Experience with container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes (K8s) and OpenShift.

*CI/CD Expertise: Experience with CI/CD deployment pipelines, ensuring automated and reliable deployment processes.

*System Architecture: Demonstrable experience in designing and deploying scalable and resilient systems, with an understanding of cloud-native principles.

*System Monitoring and Anomaly Detection: Extensive experience in implementing both blackbox and whitebox monitoring solutions, with a focus on SLOs and anomaly detection.

  

 **Bonus Skills**

  

*Linux Background: Knowledge of both Debian and Ubuntu environments.

*Familiarity with Additional Tools: Experience with Jenkins, Terraform, Datadog, K6, or similar technologies.

*Web Technologies: Understanding of web protocols and technologies such as HTTP, TLS, REST, Nginx, and API gateways.
