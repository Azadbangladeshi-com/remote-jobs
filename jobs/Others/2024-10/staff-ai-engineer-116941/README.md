# [Staff AI Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/staff-ai-engineer-116941)  
### Pulley  
#### `🌎 Remote`  

Pulley's mission is to make it easier for anyone to start a company. We believe that more startups should exist and that founder-led companies are more successful in the long term. With Pulley’s cap table management tools, companies can better understand and optimize their equity for the long term. Starting a company is hard enough. Managing equity shouldn’t be.

We’re a high-performing team looking for passionate, execution-focused, self-starters to help us build equity management tools for founders. Pulley is growing quickly with over 3000 customers including unicorns like Clubhouse, Birdies, and Coda - all within our first year of product launch.

Our trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founders’ Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels. All of our growth has been organic, and we’re growing the team to meet the demand.

**🌟 Staff AI Engineer**

We’re looking for an experienced AI Engineer who is passionate about utilizing AI to build impactful solutions. You will play a critical role in automating internal tools to improve efficiency, developing AI-powered applications to meet the needs of internal stakeholders and customers, and prototyping/experimentation. In this cross-functional role, you’ll have a unique opportunity to work closely with leadership, help develop our AI strategy, and tackle innovative projects that will directly impact how our business functions.

**🛠 Responsibilities**

  * Drive the full product development lifecycle for new platform capabilities and product experiences end-to-end
  * Utilize AI/ML products to automate internal tools and build products that drive efficiency
  * Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to understand their needs and iterate on solutions
  * Engage in prototyping and strategizing AI solutions that align with Pulley’s long-term vision

**🙌 Qualifications & Fit**

  * 6+ years of software engineering experience, and proficiency in Python 
  * Direct experience with leveraging LLMs and AI/ML technologies to develop automations and internal tools
  * Ability to quickly build and ship functioning prototypes
  * Strong familiarity with AI-powered developer tools like ChatGPT, and experience working with APIs. Bonus points for familiarity with the emerging "AI stack" including: 
    * embeddings/vector databases
    * RAG (retrieval augmented generation)
    * evals and observability
    * prompt engineering

**💚 Benefits**

US based benefits:

  * Health, Dental, and Vision insurance
  * Unlimited PTO
  * 401(k) Match

**✨ Our Culture**

TL&DR - Pulley is a unique fit, tailored for those who align with our values and culture. We are looking for people who are excited about building a great company, not just working in a high-growth startup. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:

  * First Principles Thinking. We believe in breaking down problems into their most basic parts. We don’t reject ideas because they haven’t worked before. We understand “ _why_ did certain things work?” and apply it to our situation.
  * Ship It & Iterate. Shipping is the starting line for learning. Ship something, talk to users, get feedback, and iterate. We focus on the inputs, on what we can control, not the outcomes. We take our best bets, and don’t fixate on the finish line.
  * Boldly Honest & Aggressively Considerate. Being boldly honest means we push one another to act from first principles, set and hit goals, and ruthlessly prioritize. Being aggressively considerate means we care about each other as humans to win as a team. We speak up and embrace feedback.
  * Default Yes. We believe that something is possible unless proven otherwise. Hard problems are often solved by people who didn’t know it was impossible.

We’re also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of stunning colleagues. If you like the sound of our environment and you’re passionate about joining a team like the one we’ve described, we'd love to talk!

Annual Salary Range: $150,000—$180,000 USD, plus equity to be negotiated.
