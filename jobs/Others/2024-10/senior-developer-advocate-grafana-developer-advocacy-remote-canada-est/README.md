# [Senior Developer Advocate - Grafana Developer Advocacy (Remote, Canada EST)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-developer-advocate-grafana-developer-advocacy-remote-canada-est)  
### Grafana Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Canada (Remote)`  

**This is a remote position and we're considering candidates in the Canadian Eastern timezone.**

**Our Community**

We were born from Open Source and itâ€™s in our founding and company DNA. Our job in developer advocacy is just that - to advocate for this community, and nurture the people within it. When they succeed, Grafana does as well. We believe that a big, vibrant, participatory community is how the most innovation happens, and how we grow.

**What we are looking for** :

Our ideal candidate would be an experienced technical communicator who wants to improve Grafana OSS and loves participating in open source communities. We're looking for someone who is excited about teaching, and engaging with the world in person, on online forums and in social media. If this sounds like you and you stay on top of what's happening in Grafana, observability, telemetry, or distributed systems, we should talk. We strongly encourage under-represented groups to apply.

As a Developer Advocate, you are a technologist first, and will help teach developers, SREs, administrators and others how to build with Grafana. That starts with things like dashboards, but goes much deeper into APIs, plugins, any kind of data that helps us understand complex systems and how they function. You will participate in events, author content, appear in videos, and many other programs. A big plus for us is if you already participate meaningfully in open source communities such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, or the wider CNCF.

We work with an all-remote team of advocates & community support engineers. We work in the R&D part of the organization, alongside product managers and engineers. The aim of the role is to help users build cool stuff.

The types of things you will be doing include:

  * Creating technical content to educate and empower developers & SREs; this can include sample applications, presentations, blog posts, and other materials
  * Act as an ally and colleague of external practitioners who are getting started
  * Build relationships with people across the community, to support & inspire
  * Provide feedback on our products; help be a conduit of what the community is saying, to help us improve the feedback loop between what users need and what Grafana delivers

Success in this role is measured by making our users successful. In a few months, you either already know, or will have learned about our technology and how to improve education for the community. A few months later, you will have worked on several programs in front of our community; you might be submitting talks to conferences and user groups.

**Must-Haves:**

  * Substantial technical experience, though this can come from a variety of different disciplines such as testing, software development, system integration, SRE, monitoring, observability, or operations
  * Effective communicator with lots of patience. You will be interacting with people from all over the world with varying levels of experience with Grafana and communication styles. 
  * Collaborative mindset that thrives in a culture of learning and sharing what you learn back to the team and community.
  * A background in a technical field such as a BS in Computer Science, or equivalent experience
  * Technical writing skills, as shown through any form of past written work
  * Presentation skills, for example any form of past speaking experience
  * Willingness to travel 30% of the time

**"Nice to have" skills that are not required but that we can help you build**

  * Experience with our LGTM stack
  * Experience with observability, telemetry, application performance monitoring (APM) or similar
  * History of participation in open source developer communities, in any form
  * Experience running or organizing communities
  * Experience with Cloud e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP is definitely a big plus
