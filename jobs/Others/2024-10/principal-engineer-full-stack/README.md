### Reporting, Schedule and Location

* This is a U.S. based, fully remote, full-time role reporting to our Engineering Lead. Most team members work virtually from home and are located on the east coast and internationally. You can work remotely anywhere in the US. If you prefer in-person work for any portion of the week, we currently have offices in Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Although you should expect to be available during most east coast hours, this role will also require regular synchronous collaboration with India-based members of the engineering team, on India Standard Time. For example, if you are located on the east coast, you may design your working hours to have meetings with the engineering team starting at 7am ET (4:30pm IST) some days, while finishing earlier in the afternoon.

  

### Your Skills

* Ability to decompose complex business problems and collaborate with others in solving them
* Strong analytical skills leading to demonstrated expertise in problem-solving, technical innovation and decision-making
* High standards for DevOps, code quality, performance and utilization
* Ability to think broadly and strategically coupled with the desire to directly manage projects and tasks
* Strong risk assessment and time estimation skills, including an ability to prioritize and delegate work efficiently
* Strong communication skills, including the ability to convey complex technical concepts to non-technical colleagues in an understandable and accessible way

  

### Preferred Tech Stack Experience

* Proactive in self-directing your work to areas of high impact
* Methodical and organized within an unstructured environment
* Prompt, responsive, curious and communicative, especially about new things

  

### Why You'll Love This Role:

* Ability to leverage your technical skills to support an overlooked population
* Direct involvement with saving lives by deploying a first-of-its-kind treatment model
* Scalable impact as we grow nationally, using technology to expand our reach
* Contribute to and gain expertise from a diverse, interdisciplinary team that includes clinicians, data scientists, and peer workers

  

 **Interview Process:**

  

After you submit your application, it will be reviewed by the hiring manager and select members of the team. If it seems like we’re a good fit for each other, we will follow up and schedule a 15-30 minute phone call with one of our teammates to get to know you.

Next there will be a deeper technical conversation with our Founder and Chief Product Officer. The final stage would be to meet (2-4) other members of the team via video conference for additional conversations about your approach to collaboration, your relevant experience to current projects, and alignment with our values. All in, you can expect the time commitment for this stage to be 3-4 hours of synchronous interaction, scheduled to fit your needs.

If you complete interviews, we will provide a decision or clear next step within five business days.

We are ready to hire as soon as we find the right candidate. We can’t wait to meet you!

  

**More about Marigold Health:**

  

Marigold Health is an early-stage, rapidly growing startup providing services for a range of community based mental health and substance use treatment providers as well as national health insurers. We collaborate with eminent investigators at Brown University and Johns Hopkins and have been publicly recognized by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the American Psychiatric Association.

Our program is a combination of 1-1 coaching and 24/7 anonymous chat support groups accessed over phone, SMS, and app/web. On the backend, proprietary natural language processing tools scale our peer workforce by augmenting group moderation, automating patient outreach, and sending sentiment-based “alerts” to coordinate care with other providers. Following strong results from our first clinical studies, we are entering a period of rapid growth, and expect to expand from 2 states today to 12 by this time next year.

Our core values are **authenticity** , **candor** , and **ambition**. **Inclusion** is at the core of what we do. We’re working to bring care to the most underserved and stigmatized patients. We actively welcome applicants from a wealth of different backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation). We must have diversity on our team and in our mindsets to be successful in moving the needle on the deeply entrenched and systematic challenges we face.

Marigold Health is an equal opportunity employer.
