## Description

 **About 1Password:**

 _We all have important information we need to manage, and protecting it should be easy. Over 150,000 businesses and millions of people log in to 1Password to unlock smart, simple access to everything they care about. Our vision is to create a safer, simpler digital future for everyone, and our culture values simplicity, honesty and a human-centric approach to solving problems.

For a company to exist it must both sell something and collect payments for that thing. 1Password wants to do more than exist, we want to be great - and for this we must innovate. The Billing & Payments Team runs the foundation of our SaaS business, fueling the growth of 1Password worldwide. We work with departments across the company on the most pressing business needs. We create transparent, reliable interfaces so customers can access the features they want. We provide 1Password to over 3.2 million people per month, collecting revenue of over $180 million per year and growing!

  

 **Remote by design.** 1Password has been remote-first since our inception in 2005, meaning that we’re no stranger to building digital community and culture. With our teams fully remote and located all around the world, we stay connected through company-wide events, coffee chats, fun Slack channels, and peer-to-peer recognition through Bonusly — just to name a few. Our remote environment means that you have the flexibility to make those midday workout classes, take your dog out for a walk when they need one, and run errands on your own schedule. As an intern, you can expect to set core hours with your manager, and then work when you’re at your best. We all thrive in different conditions, so we encourage you to make your workday work for you! 💙

  

This is a remote opportunity within Canada. **This is a full time (40 hours per week) position that will run for 4 months - January to April 2025.**

### What you can expect:

* Write efficient, scalable, and robust customer-facing features for the 1Password.com web service.
* Collaborate with people across the company like Product Design, Marketing, Sales, Customer Support, Quality Assurance, and other Software Development teams.
* Interpret data to design, build, test, and validate impactful solutions for customer problems.
* Take a full stack approach to development by navigating everything from databases up to the web UI.

  

### What we're looking for:

* Confidence: A willingness to take on new challenges, and see them through to completion.
* Humility: You're not afraid to ask "stupid" questions and make mistakes (as long as you learn from them).
* Curiosity: You look for better ways of doing things, even if everyone seems happy with how they are.
* Teamwork: We work together, and succeed as a team!

  

### Bonus points for:

* Back end web development experience with languages like Java, Python, Ruby, or Go.
* Front end web development experience with modern javascript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js

 **Even if you don't tick all those boxes, we'd like to hear from you.**

  

The most important thing you can bring to this job is the drive to dive in, get the work done, and fix root causes instead of treating symptoms. We believe in continuous learning and support professional development on the job with a budget to back it up. If you bring a desire to do the right thing for our customers, a sense of ownership over the product you work on, and a focus on shipping quality code, we want to hear from you.

  

 **This role will close on Friday, October 11, 2024.**

  

 **What we offer:**

  

We believe in working hard, and resting hard. We’re always looking for new ways to support our team members, but here’s a glance at what we currently offer:

  

> 🏝 Generous PTO policy - 2.08 days per month (1.5 work weeks per 4 month term)

> 💖 Company-wide wellness days off scheduled throughout the year

> 🌎 Employee-led DEIB programs and ERGs and ECGs
