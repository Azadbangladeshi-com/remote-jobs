**Philo: TV on the Internet!!!**

At Philo, weâ€™re a group of technology and product people who set out to build the future of television, marrying the best in modern technology with the most compelling medium ever invented â€” in short, weâ€™re building the TV experience that weâ€™ve always wanted for ourselves. In practice this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences.

**Qualifications**

The Philo Product Team is responsible for designing, building, testing, and quite literally reinventing television (the most engaging product ever created) across web, mobile, and TV platforms. Just as television is about more than simply watching an episode of your favorite show, so too does our work extend well beyond the play button. We take TV schedules, movie and show metadata, live and on-demand feeds, recordings, real-time localized usage metrics, cross-device interoperability, and individualized viewing habits, preferences, restrictions, and notifications â€“ massaging it all into a comprehensive and seamless TV experience.

We are positioned at the forefront of front-end development technologies, building on DRM-decrypting HTML5 video along with a modern workflow leveraging React and ES6.

  * Iteratively designing and improving upon our application UIs
  * Implementing user acquisition, engagement, and retention-oriented initiatives.
  * Prototyping, testing, and iterating upon new features.
  * Taking initiative by continually investigating anomalies in reported metrics as well as proffering or implementing solutions.
  * Communicating effectively with product, marketing, engineering, operations, and support teams to rapidly and collaboratively ship impactful work that delights our customers.

**A strong candidate should be:**

  * Highly proficient in modern web development technologies (particularly React)
  * Very comfortable developing in plain JavaScript and be experienced with Typescript
  * Comfortable with writing and maintaining scalable CSS and SASS stylesheets
  * Experienced building and maintaining large scale single page applications
  * Able to write, test, ship, and maintain clean production code within a collaborative and version-controlled (git) codebase.

**Experience with the following technologies is a plus (but not required):**

  * Redux state management
  * HTML5 video player development
  * GraphQL endpoints
  * Full stack development in Rails, Node, or a similar backend technology
