Samsaraâ€™s platform supports industries that power our economy. From managing truck fleets, to dispatching emergency vehicles, to securing warehouses, our customers depend on us for their critical operations.

Samsara is seeking an experienced Software Engineer to join our Data Ingestion team. As an engineer on the Data Ingestion team, your goal will be to continually improve the reliability, performance, and scalability of the data ingestion infrastructure that powers Samsaraâ€™s platform.

You will have an opportunity to work closely with other teams who use the systems you build & maintain, collecting immediate feedback to continuously improve this infrastructure.

**You should apply if:**

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** The software, firmware, and hardware you build will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  * **You want to build for scale:** With over 2.3 million IoT devices deployed to our global customers, you will work on a range of new and mature technologies driving scalable innovation for customers across industries driving the world's physical operations.
  * **You are a life-long learner:** We have ambitious goals. Every Samsarian has a growth mindset as we work with a wide range of technologies, challenges, and customers that push us to learn on the go.
  * **You believe customers are more than a number:** Samsara engineers enjoy a rare closeness to the end user and you will have the opportunity to participate in customer interviews, collaborate with customer success and product managers, and use metrics to ensure our work is translating into better customer outcomes.
  * **You are a team player:** Working on our Samsara Engineering teams requires a mix of independent effort and collaboration. Motivated by our mission, weâ€™re all racing toward our connected operations vision, and we intend to winâ€”together.
