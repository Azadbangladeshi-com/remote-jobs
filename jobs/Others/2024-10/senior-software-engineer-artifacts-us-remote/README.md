### Wandb  
#### `üåé remote,San Francisco, California`  

## Description

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers. We founded our company on the insight that while there were excellent tools for developers to build better code, there were no similarly great tools to help ML practitioners build better models. Starting with our first experiment tracking product, we have since expanded our solution into a comprehensive AI developer platform for organizations focused on building their own deep learning models and generative AI applications.

  

Weights & Biases is a Series C company with $250M in funding and over 200 employees. We proudly serve over 1,000 customers and more than 30 foundation model builders including customers such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Toyota.

  

As a Senior Software Engineer on our Artifacts, Registry, and Automations Team, you'll be part of a cutting-edge team that is revolutionizing machine learning workflows. You'll play a crucial role in building and optimizing systems that power artifact management, model versioning, and workflow automation. As a key member, your contributions will enhance our core artifact handling codebase, driving scalable solutions for managing the entire ML lifecycle‚Äîfrom creation and tracking to deployment.

  

You will have the unique opportunity to influence the development of W&B's emerging products, such as the Registry and Automations. Collaborating closely with across engineering, product, and real-world customers, you'll design impactful features that directly shape the future of machine learning tools. Your work will directly affect user experiences, streamlining artifact management across both cloud and on-prem environments.
