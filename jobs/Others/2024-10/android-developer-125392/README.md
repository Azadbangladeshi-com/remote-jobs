Join us in shaping the future of voice technology.

#  **About the Role:**

We are looking for an experienced Android developer to join our growing mobile team to spearhead high-impact projects in the audio AI space. Your role will include the delivery of new features to our reader app, ensuring seamless integration with our AI-driven audio functionalities. As part of our dynamic team, you will have the opportunity to identify pivotal areas where strategic initiatives or incremental efforts can drive significant impact.

We value engineers who are impact-driven, autonomous, and adept at discerning crucial insights from experimental results.

A strong background in native Android development with a proven track record is required.

#  **In this role, you will:**

  * Drive the development of innovative features in our reader app through a combination of data analysis, product ideation, and experimentation to optimize user experiences.

  * Plan and deploy mobile platform infrastructure necessary to build, test, and deploy these product experiences.

  * Collaborate closely with design, product, research, and data science teams to achieve product goals.

  * Contribute to the architecture and technical direction of the app.

  * Ensure the performance, quality, and responsiveness of the application.

  * Participate in code reviews and contribute to best practices and coding standards.

  * Continuously discover, evaluate, and implement new technologies to maximize development efficiency.

Looking ahead, you will also play a key role in creating a new, confidential project within the audio AI space, leveraging your expertise to shape its success.

#  **You might thrive in this role if you:**

  * Have shipped features on Android that optimize user experiences and drive engagement.

  * Are highly analytical and have experience designing and implementing A/B tests, with a scientific approach to data-based experiments.

  * Have a voracious and intrinsic desire to learn and fill in missing skills, and an equally strong talent for sharing that information clearly and concisely with others.

  * Are comfortable with ambiguity and rapidly changing conditions, viewing changes as an opportunity to add structure and order when necessary.

  * Are located between GMT+3 and GMT -7

This is an exciting opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and make a significant impact on the future of audio AI applications.

#  **What we offer:**

  *  **Stock options** ; we want you to have ownership in the company and share the successes that lie ahead. Thatâ€™s why we offer early employees stock options as part of their compensation package.

  *  **Remote-first** ; we look at who you are rather than where you live. Thatâ€™s why we are growing across the globe and support your preferred location.

  *  **Huge impact** ; thereâ€™s no endless iteration on the same small detail. Youâ€™ll own huge chunks of our app, and ship features impacting millions of users.

  *  **Extraordinary team** ; we favor ambitious, smart people striving for outsized impact. Youâ€™ll work on the state of the art surrounded by people with extraordinary skills and positive attitudes.

  *  **Annual company off-sites** ; the last two were in Portugal and Switzerland. Next stop: Croatia!

  * We offer competitive compensation and are open to candidates from mid - to staff level. Given the broad range, we'll be happy to discuss specific salary details during our initial conversation.
