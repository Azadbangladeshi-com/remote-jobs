### Mercury  
#### `ðŸŒŽ San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Portland, OR, or Remote within Canada or United States`  

At Mercury, we are building the banking* stack for startups and doing so with a focus on building a high-craft, simple, and powerful product experience.

The Mercury Dashboard Experience team is obsessively focused on delivering a high-quality end-to-end experience for our users. Our team works as the connective tissue across Mercury to define, design, and deliver user-facing experiences that cut across product areas. We are responsible for creating simple, powerful, and beautiful product experiences that users love and believe using Mercury should be magical from day one, whether running a single e-commerce side hustle or scaling a unicorn tech company.

_* Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group; Member FDIC_.

As part of this role, you will:

  * Feel a strong sense of product ownership and actively seek responsibility â€“ we often self-organize on small/medium projects, and we want someone whoâ€™s excited to help shape and build the future of Mercury.
  * Work closely with designers, product leaders, and other engineers to build platform wide features that solve cross cutting customer pain points.

The ideal candidate for the role:

  * Has 5+ years of software development experience, with a knowledge of or excitement to learn Haskell.
  * Has made large/complex architectural decisions in the past and seen the impact of those decisions over time. You should be able to clearly articulate your technical opinions and lay out tradeoffs.
  * Is a product-minded technical leader who is experienced and passionate about building and scaling new products for our customers.
  * Is comfortable driving discussions in areas with ambiguous ownership, approaches them with empathy, and delights in getting outcomes. Our work touches many other teams and areas of the product; youâ€™ll have a lot of autonomy and the expectation is youâ€™ll use that to seek out ways to create a leveraged impact.
  * Is ridiculously helpful, taking initiative to make your coworkersâ€™ lives easier.
