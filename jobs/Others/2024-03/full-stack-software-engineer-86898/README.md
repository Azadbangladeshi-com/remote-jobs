This position reports to the Head of Engineering.

### Requirements

### What youâ€™ll do

You will be a member of our Engineering team working closely with Product, Design, Data Science, Community, and Policy teams to build scalable web applications, APIs, data pipelines, and apps. On a typical day you might be prototyping a solution to a new problem area, building a new feature into an existing product, working on integrating data from a partner, or improving the developer experience in one of our codebases.

### You will:

  * Collaborate and consult with Product, Design, Policy, Community, and Data Science teams from the earliest stage of project explorations.
  * Create high quality and robust web applications, data models, APIs, and/or user interfaces.
  * Participate in design discussions and code reviews with your teammates and collaborators
  * Build seamless and resilient integrations with external API services (e.g. Auth0, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Geocodio, Zuplo, Amplitude, Segment).
  * Write code that is appropriately modular, maintainable, and secure.
  * Proactively identify opportunities to enhance developer productivity and enjoy writing and maintaining technical documentation.
  * Proactively mitigate issues through test-driven development, continuous deployment, and thoughtful monitoring and alerting.

### Who you are

You love designing and implementing scalable web services, applications, and APIs. You take satisfaction from seeing your work out in the world solving real problems for your customers. You may have a particular strength, specialism, or preferred area of work (e.g. backend, frontend, data) or preferred set of tooling. However, as an experienced engineer, you know what it takes to put a whole project together end-to-end and youâ€™re comfortable learning any new tools that the team decides are necessary.

### Requirements

### Core

  * Commitment to the mission, policies, and goals of Rewiring America.
  * 3+ years of software engineering experience.
  * Experience writing and operating production web services using Python/Django, Node/Express, Ruby/Rails, Java/Spring, or equivalent backend frameworks.
  * Experience with a JavaScript framework such as React, or equivalent, and supporting technologies like CSS, HTML.
  * Experience modeling and querying complex real-world domains with relational datastores, SQL, or equivalent database technologies.
  * Ability to establish scope of assigned tasks, execute on them, and independently communicate status updates.
  * You enjoy collaborative code reviews and can provide thoughtful, constructive feedback to peers.

### Even Better

  * Experience implementing modular and accessible UI components to support a design system.
  * Experience building, operating, documenting, and supporting developer-facing APIs.
  * Experience with machine learning (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow) and / or big data infrastructure (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift, Kafka).
  * Production experience with cloud technologies such as Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Functions (or their AWS/Azure equivalents).
  * Experience with CI/CD pipelines (e.g. Github Actions, Google Cloud Run) or infrastructure as code (e.g. Terraform).
