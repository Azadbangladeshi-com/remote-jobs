### About Gusto

Gusto is a modern, online people platform that helps small businesses take care of their teams. On top of full-service payroll, Gusto offers health insurance, 401(k)s, expert HR, and team management tools. Today, Gusto offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York serve more than 300,000 businesses nationwide.

Our mission is to create a world where work empowers a better life, and it starts right here at Gusto. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re committed to building a collaborative and inclusive workplace, both physically and virtually. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy.

Weâ€™re hiring engineers to join these teams and work on customer-facing products, developing features and iterating across our platform to help define the customer financial journey at Gusto. Our main goal in the teams is to strengthen our customers' financial wellness and to deliver a consistently great experience across all of our products.

Weâ€™re looking for talented and motivated engineers to lead and grow projects from end-to-end by influencing initial feature specs, building backend APIs, writing frontend code, and overseeing ongoing improvements for deployed features. At the end of the day, youâ€™ll close your laptop knowing your work is making a difference for millions of employees, and hundreds of thousands of business owners. If youâ€™re interested in building elegant software with far-reaching effects in our modern economy and working remotely, join us!

### Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll do day-to-day:

  * Architect, build, and test Gustoâ€™s product suite the spans across Payroll, Benefits, HR, Time, Tax Credits, and much more
  * Solve some of the hardest technical problems out there in very complex domains and at a large scale
  * Work and help scale one of the largest Ruby/Rails and Typescript/React applications in the world
  * Collaborate with our product management and design teams to understand customer pain points, come up with solutions, and then prototype, iterate, and launch daily
  * Build a product that our customers genuinely love. Don't just take our word for it - check out what some customers have to say.

### Hereâ€™s what we're looking for:

  * 3+ years of technical experience
  * Strong data modelling skillset
  * Passion about creating memorable experiences for customers
  * Interest in complex product development problems -- we use Rails React, but you donâ€™t have to know them
  * Appreciation for a collaborative, test-driven environment
  * Well-structured, easily maintainable, well-documented code that balances beauty and pragmatism

Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately **2-3 days** per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale.

Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.

When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required.
