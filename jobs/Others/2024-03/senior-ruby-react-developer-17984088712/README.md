### **Description**

 **Position: Senior** Ruby + React Developer

 **Type of contract:** Independent contractor

 **Scope of the Role**

We're working really hard to help more and more customers, and we need a committed and hardworking senior developer to join our team. You'll be working directly with the founders to help Shopify merchants grow their business. By sharing your smart ideas, you'll solve problems in supply chain and logistics, fix things that aren't working, and make our products better. We're all about building the best solutions to help our clients' businesses grow!

  
  

 **Duties and responsibilities:**

  * Can independently take an expected business outcome with initial, loose designs and see it through from building out a task list in Linear, breaking down PRs into smaller, deployable code chunks, testing on staging, deploying to production, and then monitoring app performance post-deploy.
  * Recognizes the importance of and is enthusiastic about timely dependency upgrades in our applications, equating this task with the excitement of working on greenfield projects, understanding its value in app security and enhancing customer experience.
  * Clearly share your work using digital tools like Slack, GitHub pull requests, or when working together to solve problems.

  * Handle many tasks at once, even when they change quickly.
  * Stay calm when things get tough. Even when many Rollbar errors come into Slack, background tasks fill up the Sidekiq queue, and the app downtime monitors are going off.
  * Be okay with working from home. We use Slack as our main way to communicate.
