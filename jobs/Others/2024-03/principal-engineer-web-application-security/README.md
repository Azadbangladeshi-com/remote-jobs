Description

At Cisco Meraki, we know that technology can connect, empower, and drive us. Our mission is to simplify technology so our customers can focus on what's most meaningful to them: their students, patients, customers, and businesses. Weâ€™re making networking easier, faster, and smarter with technology that simply works.

The modern world runs on the internet, and the internet cannot exist without its underlying infrastructure. Meraki makes setting up, managing, and maintaining that infrastructure easier than it has ever been before. Meraki enables connectivity everywhere from neighborhood cafes to education institutions to global hospitality groups operating thousands of sites.

## The Opportunity:

You are an inspiring innovator, mentor, and coach, conversant and passionate about the intersection of secure software development and a great customer experience. You lead by example and demonstrate excellence in collaboration and communication across engineering teams, with an interest in creative problem solving and a consistent track record for leading and directly chipping in to transformational changes that impact security. You are proficient at writing code and deploying it into a distributed architecture. You are also an effective spokesperson and champion for engineering teams, passionate about mentoring and developing engineers. You are an inspiring leader and a thorough problem solver who is equally comfortable and capable interacting with technologists as with senior business executives with the ability to articulate the value and risks of the proposed solution. You value simplicity at scale and are dedicated to maintaining a culture of quality, reliability, security, and
focused execution.

## We are looking for:

Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location.

Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation.

Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.
