We put power in the hands of small-dollar donors and help thousands of groups â€” from presidential candidates to environmental organizations â€” build grassroots movements. We envision a democracy where everyone looking to make progressive people-powered change can easily and effectively deploy their resources, energy, and creativity to shape our country and futures.
