Description

### About the Job

We are looking for a few amazing software developers to join our globally remote team at Cliniko. This is no ordinary jobâ€”weâ€™ll likely provide you with the best place to work youâ€™ve ever experienced! This is a full stack web development role with a focus on the server side. Weâ€™re keen to find smart developers who work well autonomously and are passionate about what they do. You should be experienced in software development, but thereâ€™s no requirement for how much or with any specific technologies. Weâ€™re mostly seeking senior or mid level developers, but we will consider any stand out applications.

### What is Cliniko?

Cliniko is practice management software that makes life easy for allied health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, running video consultations, and much more. The software is used globally by 100,000+ people every day.

Itâ€™s a web application built using Ruby on Rails in the back end and weâ€™re in the process of transitioning the front end to React.

### Our team

Behind Cliniko is a team of about 50 people, spread around the world. We work completely remotely, although our base is in Melbourne, Australia. We care more about finding the best person for the job than looking for someone that lives nearby.

We don't have managers, we almost never have meetings, and there are no time sheets to complete. We're responsible, autonomous, creative, and proactive in doing our best for our customers. We're focused on making great software and we take pride in doing good work. Itâ€™s also important to us that we have a positive impact on the world.

If you want to know more about how we work, our founder, Joel, gave a talk about it.

### What youâ€™ll work on

You will spend your time developing Cliniko. Some of the things youâ€™ll do are:

  * Adding new features.
  * Improving existing features.
  * Fixing bugs.
  * Refactoring code.
  * Maintaining the existing code.
  * Reviewing code written by other developers.
  * Making Cliniko faster.
  * Improving security.
  * Resolving issues for customers.
  * Assisting the support team with queries. 
  * Testing and deploying your own code.
  * Anything else you think needs doing.

Basically, youâ€™ll be doing all you can to make Cliniko better for our customers.

### About you

You are someone who loves to code and values code that is easy to understand. Youâ€™re passionate about your work having a positive impact. You want to learn and share what you know.

Taking initiative and being responsible come naturally to you. You want your code meticulously reviewed, so that you can improve it. You also enjoy doing the same in return. You like working with a team, but you are driven and motivated to take control of your projects and deliver your own code.

You understand the importance of security practices in your development. You write tests because they matter, not just to achieve coverage.

Youâ€™re comfortable working from the database through to the DOM. This includes:

  * Relational databases.
  * Queues and caches.
  * Server side web frameworks.
  * JSON APIs, our own and 3rd party services.
  * Client side JS.

You're proficient in all of these and extremely capable in at least a few. Experience with Ruby on Rails is not required, but similar experience and an ability to quickly come up to speed is. In this role you don't need to have extensive skills in HTML and CSSâ€”we have team members who excel at those who will help you out.

No matter what your background is or how you identify, if you feel you meet the requirements, we encourage you to apply. We know that having a diverse team brings the benefit of different perspectives, and this is how weâ€™ll keep finding new ways to make Cliniko better. We are committed to the continual diversification of the team and working to constantly improve our inclusivity which is crucial to how we work.
