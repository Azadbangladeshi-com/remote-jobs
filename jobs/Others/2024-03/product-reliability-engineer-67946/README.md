# [Product Reliability Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/product-reliability-engineer-67946)  
### Palantir Technologies  
#### `üåé United States`  
A World-Changing Company  
Palantir builds the world‚Äôs leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.  
The Role  
Product Reliability Engineers (PREs) are the driving forces of stability across Palantir‚Äôs products. Product Reliability Engineers help to ensure our products are available 24/7. When something goes wrong, Product Reliability Engineers are the first to respond and are responsible for triaging, troubleshooting, and coordinating the resolution of the issue.  
Every day at Palantir is different: we‚Äôre constantly evolving to better respond to customer needs, and as a PRE you will embed with our engineering and business teams to minimize risks associated with the deployment of our products. You are a resourceful, creative, and agile problem solver who is able to work both collaboratively and independently to resolve the most difficult and nebulous technical issues. This includes creating product health metrics and automated alerts, fixing product bugs, and developing and documenting strategies for responding to incidents.  
Whatever the technical issue or question about Palantir‚Äôs products is, you‚Äôll play a central and critical role in resolving it ‚Äî seeking not just a one-time fix, but a permanent solution.

### Example Projects

  * Product Observability: PREs embed with Palantir‚Äôs development teams to build and refine: metrics, logging, monitoring, and alerting for our products to enable proactive (and increasingly automated) issue identification, prevention, and remediation. This serves to improve the performance and uptime of our products, as well as provide detailed telemetry that aids in debugging complex issues (e.g., building monitoring to understand when a new feature is not working as expected or when a new release has introduced a product regression).
  * Empowering users to troubleshoot their own issues: Because PREs own their product‚Äôs stability work, they are uniquely qualified to identify areas in the product where users are unable to easily understand why something goes wrong when it does. PREs make this easier by building self-serve tools/processes that allow product users to better understand what the blockers are (e.g., whether a build failing is access-related or a product bug).
  * Product Reliability Systems and Process: PREs are amongst the most seasoned users of our deployment and stability infrastructure, which means they often identify opportunities for additional functionality that would improve operational efficiency. An important part of the PRE role is partnering with other infrastructure and operational teams across Palantir to provide this input and, where appropriate, directly deliver features that will benefit product operations (e.g., developing a system that automatically de-duplicates product alerts and enables teams to prioritize and document critical information).

### Core Responsibilities

  * Develop a deep understanding of Palantir's products and processes.
  * Collaborate with customer-facing, product, and infrastructure teams on the development and deployment of scalable, reliable software for our customers.
  * Diagnose, resolve, and prevent issues encountered in the field.
  * Reduce the operational overhead of Palantir‚Äôs products and leverage data to understand the largest sources of reliability risk.
  * Deliver end-to-end improvements to stability by proactively preventing issues via telemetry and automation and directly reducing the need for reactive support. 
  * Make data-driven decisions about investments in stability and reliability.
  * Take part in a 24/7 on-call rotation responsible for coordinating Palantir‚Äôs response to mission-critical incidents, ensuring efficient resolution with minimal customer impact.

### What We Value

  * Excellent problem solving skills, ability to break down and explain complex concepts, and strong attention to detail.
  * Comfort working in a fast moving environment with dynamic objectives that require creative thinking to address product and customer needs.
  * Ability to work both independently and make decisions under minimal supervision, as well as collaborate as part of a team.
  * Experience coding with Java, Go and/or web technologies (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python/Ruby, Django/Flask/Ruby on Rails, etc.) is a plus.
  * Experience with distributed computing systems and/or cloud infrastructures (e.g. Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.) is a plus.

### What We Require

  * Background in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Systems, or other technical field.
  * Willingness and interest to travel to other Palantir locations as needed.
