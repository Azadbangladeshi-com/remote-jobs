We are looking for a Senior iOS Engineer with native iOS development experience to join the Mobile team responsible for this digital product. On the team, youâ€™ll work on every aspect of the customer journey â€“ from getting users into the app, giving them the best, stage-based developmental information tailored to their child, helping them get specific questions answered by child development experts, and helping them learn how to play and get more value out of our toys. Youâ€™ll own the client-side app architecture and build best-in-class beautiful and flexible UI, content management, account and subscription management, digital payments, tools for our developmental experts and more. You will do it all with a platform focus in mind - scaling our global audience to millions of customers and continuously looking for opportunities to enhance our technology, increase velocity and maintain a high quality bar. This is a front-end role that covers architectural vision to implementation.
