### Company Description

 **About Shopify**

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. Since 2006, weâ€™ve grown to over 10,000 employees and generated over $500 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts peopleâ€™s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

 **About you**  
  
Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguityâ€”and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

 **Before you apply, consider if you can:**

  * Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
  * Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
  * Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
  * Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
  * Bring critical thought and opinion â€” and embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
  * Work digital-first for your daily work
