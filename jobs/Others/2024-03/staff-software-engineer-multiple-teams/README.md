### Company Description

 **About Shopify**

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. Since 2006, we‚Äôve grown to over 10,000 employees and generated over $500 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. Every 28 seconds, an entrepreneur on Shopify makes their first sale.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts people‚Äôs lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

 **About you**  
  
Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity‚Äîand a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:

  * Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
  * Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
  * Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
  * Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
  * Bring critical thought and opinion ‚Äî and embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
  * Work digital-first for your daily work

### Job Description

We are not here to play zero-sum games. Our Staff Engineer role is all about enabling entrepreneurship and creating new value for the world. We believe in unlimited personal growth for the individuals who join our team. We are not about following strict processes or micromanaging. We operate on trust and focus on making a real impact.

To thrive in this role, you have to deeply care about what you do and continuously develop your craft. We are not for everyone. If you prefer a rigid corporate structure and an in-person office environment, we're not the right fit. But if you're seeking hypergrowth, love solving complex problems, and can handle a bit of chaos, you've found your place.

We are a team of independent thinkers who are dedicated to growth. We care deeply about our work, but we also understand the bigger picture. To make commerce better for everyone, we must serve and support those who may have different beliefs than us. This means leaving personal biases outside the room and embracing constant learning and discomfort.

Joining our team means working with the most driven individuals who strive for mastery. Growth is not just an opportunity here; it's an expectation. We provide resources to help you push yourself out of your comfort zone. We thrive on change and chaos because we are building products for the long-term. We want Shopify to be a 100-year company, and that requires resilience and the ability to navigate ambiguity.

If you're ready to embrace constant growth, challenge yourself, and thrive in a fast-paced environment, then this software engineering role is for you. We don't just want you to survive; we want you to thrive amidst change and chaos.

  *  **Backend Development** \- requires a strong understanding of modern web/cloud development practices, familiarity or willingness to learn GraphQL, and a strong command of your preferred programming languages
  *  **Frontend Development** \- requires a strong knowledge of and working experience with Javascript, and experience building solutions across all parts of the frontend/UI using modern tools like React/Typescript/GraphQL is ideal
  *  **Fullstack Development** \- requires a strong understanding of all layers of a software application, and mastery of React and Ruby is preferred
  *  **Infrastructure Development** \- requires a strong understanding of building scalable, performant, secure, innovative, composable, and cost-effective infrastructure

### Qualifications

  * Proficiency with multiple programming languages and frameworks
  * Depth and breadth of experience with different technologies across the stack, and strong opinions on pros and cons of each
  * Demonstrated ability to identify and resolve high-value technical issues within the team's scope, driving them to effective solutions.
  * Deep experience building large scale, high throughput distributed systems and scaling web services, particularly those using and analyzing large amounts of data
