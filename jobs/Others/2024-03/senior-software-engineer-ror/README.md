We are 100% cloud-based, hosting on AWS/Heroku. In this role you will work remotely with colleagues across the organization to design, develop, and deliver valuable software to our customers and continuously improve the way we do it.

### What you will be doing:

  * Be the thought leader of the RoR development space - designs, infrastructure, algorithms and data structures. You will work side-by-side with the technical founder setting the technical direction of the team and influence across the department.
  * Tackle complex problems, resolve them, and ensure solutions prevent future issues.

  * Communicate across the org to ensure your team is effective and achieves their goals.
  * Work up and down the stack to implement new features and improve our systems. Our stack is Ruby/Rails, AWS/Heroku, Postgres, Redis, and React.

  * Degree in Computer Science or equivalent, or similar professional experience
  * 7+ years experience in software generally, ideally in SaaS
  * 5+ years experience in Ruby on Rails

  * Experience improving the practices of your team and organization
  * Experience ensuring non functional requirements are met and maintained.
  * A track record of accepting feedback and working to improve.
