Description

### **About the Company**

Infillion provides full-service media solutions to agencies and brands, engages in proprietary relationships with partners and publishers, and facilitates outstanding consumer experiences that are superior to conventional interruptive advertising models. Infillion also provides programmatic advertising solutions through our MediaMath platformâ€”recognized as the best DSP on the market. Infillion deeply values consumersâ€™ time, attention, and privacy, and puts a premium on employee satisfaction, talent development, and exemplary leadership.

**About the Job**

As a Software Development Engineer, your role will primarily consist of constructing and deploying well-thought out UI experiences for immediate use by our high value customers. In addition to being focused on UI/UX best practices, you will be asked to contribute to the development and debugging of our backend REST microservices that deliver mission-critical campaign data across the company. While your day to day will be React/TypeScript and Ruby on Rails in a cloud-native environment, you will also be called upon to grow into other technologies. Most importantly, you will be a member of a smaller, extremely collaborative, and supportive team, where proactivity and critical thinking are essential ingredients in achieving our project goals, together.

**What youâ€™ll be doing:**

**First 30 days:**

  * Up to speed on our frontend technology stack, pushing code to support bug fixes and enhancements
  * Up to speed on the high-level architecture and data flow of our frontend customer-facing application
  * Comfortable with the basics of our e2e advertising campaign submission flow

**First 90 days:**

  * Pushing code to support bug fixes and enhancements in backend API applications
  * Introducing more significant, tested React components and features to the codebase
  * Spanning across the stack to define JSON API contracts for e2e features

**First 6 months:**

  * Working within multiple components of our system, across the stack, independently
  * Capable of resolving larger production issues and communicating fixes to stakeholders
  * Identifying and implementing larger improvements / refactors to frontend and backend codebases

**First year:**

  * Owning larger UI projects of increased magnitude and complexity
  * Offering support across multiple teams to drive frontend and backend tech consolidation
  * Mentoring new / junior engineers and providing sound guidance where necessary

**What you have:**

  * 1-3+ years of professional software development experience
  * Experience leveraging frameworks like React, MUI (Material-UI), Semantic UI, and JavaScript to create responsive user interfaces
  * Experience with backend web frameworks and REST APIs
  * A proven ability to communicate effectively and be a strong teammate
  * The ability to be gritty and push projects to 100% completion

**Who you are:**

  * **A proactive doer** â€” you fix problems without being asked, and you take it upon yourself to learn what you need to learn to accomplish your task
  * **A critical thinker** â€” you do not default to taking information at face value, and you think critically, arrive at your own conclusions (even if different from popular opinion), and propose them to your team
  * **A curious explorer -** you are curious how the larger system works and how your components fit within it, and you always strive to become an expert in your domain

**Nice to haves**

  * Understanding of and experience with the advertising technology industry
  * Experience with Jest, GitHub Actions, and basic AWS technologies
  * Deeper knowledge and experience with relational and non-relational databases

**Benefits & Perks**

Itâ€™s no secret that we work hard, but we also strive to create an office environment where the lines between work and play are blurred. This means we offer these great perks to help keep our team healthy, productive, and happy.

  * Base salary of $85,000 CAD - $95,000 CAD plus bonus for on target earnings of $90,000 - $100,000 CAD
