### **Engineering at Oyster**

At Oyster, we are on a mission to create a more equal world by making it possible for companies everywhere to hire people anywhere. The Engineering team is responsible for building the platform, tooling, automation, and experience to help Oyster achieve this mission. Together with Product and Design, we partner closely with subject matter experts in Finance, Legal, Workplace, and more to build and refine our offerings to make a single product that is a pleasure to work with. We‚Äôre breaking new ground in the hiring market and have many interesting challenges to tackle!

We seek out and build up engineers and leaders who have strong software engineering fundamentals, value transparency, promote knowledge sharing, and thrive in a distributed, remote-first, and asynchronous working environment.

Our current technology stack includes Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and we deploy to Heroku.

We have nearly 100 engineers partnered with our Product and Design teams to make up several agile product development teams focusing on improving and expanding several areas of our product.

Finally, we live and champion our company values.

  * **We elevate talent:** We hire our team (using our own product!) and continue to grow their abilities through mentorship, challenges that stretch and strengthen their skills, and giving them room to explore.
  * **We build trust:** We are transparent and promote an active flow of information throughout the team. We believe that people can do their best work when they feel supported, heard, and safe to challenge ideas to make the product and team or company stronger. To do that, we value the egoless sharing of information and transparency throughout the company, actively promote knowledge sharing, and a safe environment to try and fail. Failures are not the end; they are moments to learn and grow!
  * **We thrive together:** By building upon our first two values, we promote teamwork and collaboration to create a globally-minded, remote-first company that values collective wins over individual wins.
