Would you like to make innovation happen? Have you ever dreamed of building Products that impact millions of users? Nice! Then we have a seat for you on our team!

###  **What are you going to do?**

You will have the opportunity to work in a forward-thinking and growth-oriented environment, at a company that helps commercial tenants make better real estate decisions that drive the operational needs and growth of their business.  
New US GAAP and IASB standards, and the COVID-19 pandemic, have forced companies to completely rethink how they manage and account for their real estate. Legacy lease management processes, reliant on offline work and 15+-year-old tools, fail to meet current needs, signaling a major opportunity for innovation.  
The client aspires to be the platform where all commercial real estate decisions are made, facilitating the access to data and collaboration required by all stakeholders that require it.  
The client teamâ€™s unique combination of commercial real estate, proptech, and consulting positions us to understand and execute the problems facing our customers.

### Occupy a unique position in the market:

  * You will set standards best practices, and do a code review.
  * You will work with Product Management, UX, and other engineers to refine and iterate on specifications as the features take shape.
  * You will interface directly with our Customer Success team to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular support rotation.
  * You will seek to understand the domain, user personas, problems they face, architecture of our product, and product roadmap.

### What will help you succeed

  * 5+ years of professional web development experience with Ruby on Rails.
  * Experience modeling complex relational database schema.
  * Have mentored junior developers.
  * 2+ years of production experience in React (or Vue, Angular, Ember, etc.) is a NICE TO HAVE.
