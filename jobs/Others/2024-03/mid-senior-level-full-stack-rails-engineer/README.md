Your new role at SparkLoop  
**  

At SparkLoop, we are building the future of newsletter growth, empowering thousands of the world‚Äôs top newsletters and media brands.  
  

As our newest engineer, you‚Äôll play a pivotal role in shaping our platform, taking on the challenge of building and scaling the most complex, business-crucial features we have planned to elevate our impact to the next level.

**  
Tech Stack  
**  

Our stack is "vanilla" Rails: Ruby on Rails with Hotwire/Stimulus, Tailwind, ViewComponent & Sidekiq.  
  

Database: Postgres & ClickHouse.  
  

‚ÄçInfra/Ops **:** Heroku, AppSignal, GitHub Actions, Stripe

About you  
**  

We're on the hunt for folks who know their way around Rails and have a knack for turning ideas into real, live products. You should be comfortable with Ruby, Rails, and the essentials of making stuff work on the web: HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Good writing matters a lot to us because it makes everything else we do clearer and sharper, from coding to chatting about ideas.  
  

We keep things lean on the management side, so you'll get to take the wheel on your projects. We are hiring Managers of One: people who can manage themselves and dig an environment where they're trusted to make choices and lead the way.  
  

Experience is great, but we don't expect you to dive in at full speed from day one. You'll get a smooth, thoughtful onboarding to get you up to speed with how we do things, our systems, and getting to know the team.  
  

This is a remote job, however to make sure time zones overlap with our current crew, we‚Äôre only looking for people based in the Americas, Africa, or Europe.

‚Äç  
  

**  
Signs this role is perfect for you  
**  

You have:  
  

  * Excellent communication skills, time management, developer principles and collaborative attitude
  * A pragmatic approach to problem solving
  * You are self organized and comfortable with ambiguity. We are a startup after all!
  * Fluent English, written and spoken
  * Working hours with US or EU timezones, or 4+ hours overlap
  * Confident Ruby on Rails development skills, with experience writing secure, maintainable code
  * A minimum of 3 years working professionally with Ruby on Rails - if you don‚Äôt have three years of experience but can demonstrate a confident grasp of Ruby on Rails, we encourage you to apply
  * Postgres experience
  * Version control understanding (Git)
  * Experience with continuous integration and continuous deployment
  * Experience writing code that is accessible, scalable, maintainable, and performant

Desired but not required:  
  

  * Experience deploying to cloud-based infrastructure (Heroku)
  * Experience working on a SaaS product
  * Experience with the Shape-Up methodology
  * Experience with ClickHouse

In just four years, our small team of twelve has built the best toolkit for newsletter growth used by thousands of top newsletters and media brands ‚Äî from Morning Brew to household names like James Clear and Tim Ferriss. And we have big plans for the next three years.
