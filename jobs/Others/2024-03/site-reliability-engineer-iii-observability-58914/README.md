### Site Reliability Engineer III, Observability

### Summary

Wikimedia Foundation is hiring a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to join our SRE team, where we take care of the infrastructure that runs wikipedia.org and other Wikimedia Foundation projects. We are responsible for the entire infrastructure stack, from multiple data centers through networking and interconnects to thousands of servers and the application stack that runs on them.

We are a diverse, distributed team of engineers with a drive to explore, experiment, and embrace new technologies. We are transitioning our platform from a monolith to a hybrid microservices architecture and have implemented these microservices on our on-premises Kubernetes platform with an in-house designed deployment pipeline. We‚Äôve adopted the Elastic Stack and Prometheus as our de facto logging and monitoring platforms. We automate the operational tasks with various technologies, mainly Python and Puppet. We ensure the availability and reliability of one of the most used sites on the Internet and develop the software we need to achieve these goals - for example, our automation platform ‚Äúspicerack‚Äù (https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-software-spicerack), which we use to develop cookbooks for repeatable tasks (we ‚ù§Ô∏è automation).

We work in the open and document our activities on our task management system (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org) and our technical wiki (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org). Last but not least, our Grafana instance is publicly available! (https://grafana.wikimedia.org) Feel free to check out our work there.

We are avid supporters of open-source software. If you have interesting open-source contributions, let us know!

If you find what we do exciting and enjoy working with a globally distributed team that runs a Top-15 website, we may be the place you‚Äôre looking for.

As an engineer in the SRE team, you will be involved in defining and running the infrastructure and services that form the base of Wikimedia Foundation projects. This will include frequent work with other SRE members to improve our scalability, high availability, recoverability, monitoring, and logging infrastructure. You will participate in incident response and the on-call rotation. You will also frequently interact with people not in SRE, like Security, Release, and Software Engineers, who all strive to improve MediaWiki and related software.

We use more technologies than we can list here and are interested in your experience, even if it doesn‚Äôt exactly match the keywords listed here.

##### Responsibilities:

  * Implementation and maintenance of Internet-facing infrastructure and services
  * Use of configuration management and deployment tools
  * Monitoring of systems and services, optimization of performance, and resource utilization
  * Typical operating system-level tasks such as logging and backup / restore
  * Cookbook/runbook implementation for everyday maintenance actions
  * Incident response, diagnosis, and follow-up on system outages or alerts
  * Collaborating with a global and asynchronously communicating team (don‚Äôt worry if you have never worked remotely; we‚Äôll help you get used to it)

##### Qualifications:

  * 2+ years experience in an SRE/Operations/DevOps role
  * Experience with operating highly available infrastructure
  * Comfortable with shell and a programming language used in an SRE/Operations engineering context (Python, Go, Ruby, etc.)
  * Experience with package management for operating systems (Debian, etc.)
  * Comfortable with Open Source configuration management and orchestration tools (Puppet, Ansible, TerraForm, etc.)
  * Past exposure to automation and streamlining of tasks
  * Communicative technical English

##### We would love it if you have:

  * A history of contributing to Open Source projects
  * Prior participation in the Wikimedia movement
  * Hands-on experience with Observability related tools practices (tracing, logging, metrics, performance monitoring, SLOs, and alerting)
