### Introduction

The Zebra, named a Best Place to Work in Austin four years running, is revolutionizing how connected consumers research and shop for insurance. We intentionally strive to build diverse teams that feel inclusive for all.

Our Zeebs are passionate about learning, growing, & working together to tackle exciting problems.

The Zebra seeks a Full Stack Software Engineer with strong frontend experience to expand our growing team.

You must be comfortable working on experimental, rapid-prototyping projects and building long-term, sustainable, scalable solutions. Our software engineers play a vital role in taking projects from spec to concept and building them with high-quality, creative, simple, and sophisticated solutions.

### Location

While we are open to remote work across the contingent US, we are still in the process of establishing our company to support work in all states! We‚Äôve recently made the shift from an in-office organization to a hybrid model and love the flexibility it allows our employees. We are set up to support employees who want to be fully remote, in-office only, and a mix of the two. Please note - we will not support work based out of the following states: CA, MA, NY, NJ.

### What You'll Do

  * Assist in the design, implementation, and maintenance of the Zebra comparison product and other products across the stack using Python, Django, FastAPI, ReactJS, NodeJS, and other modern technologies
  * Deliver focused, maintainable, and performant code across different areas of our business, from adding new functionality to existing cloud-hosted microservices to creating new features supporting growth into new insurance lines
  * Work closely with other software engineers, quality engineers, product managers, and designers to rapidly build, iterate, test, and deploy new features and products and maintain a high-quality, robust codebase
  * Improve and scale the existing products and tools to support our growth

### What We're Looking For

As we evaluate candidates across all roles, we look for folks who have a strong sense of ownership, great communication and collaboration skills, and a dedication to continuous improvement.

  * 3+ years of professional programming experience
  * Demonstrated proficiency with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
  * Demonstrated proficiency with one of the following: Python, Ruby, Java, C++, C#, or Go 
  * Strong experience with relational and NoSQL databases
  * Fluency with Linux/Unix command line
  * Proven web development experience
  * Eagerness to take ownership of work and collaboration with team members throughout the product development lifecycle

### Experience that Will Impress the Heck Out of Us:

  * Experience working in consumer-facing web products, growth-phase startups and/or using A/B testing and data to drive product decisions
  * Deep knowledge of one or more frontend JavaScript frameworks, like React or Angular
  * Proficiency with backend frameworks such as FastAPI or Django

### Benefits & Perks:

Inclusive and healthy environments are crafted intentionally. All of our employees can join and participate in (or create your own!) Employee Resource Groups. Here are some other wonderful perks of working here:

  * Competitive Compensation & Stock Option Offering
  * Health, Dental, Vision & Disability Coverages
  * HSA offering + employer contribution
  * 401k plan + employer match
  * Unlimited PTO (paid time off)+ the flexibility to enjoy it
