**ABOUT THE ROLE:**

We are on a mission to transform the US Healthcare system, and we need a Software Engineer to help us achieve this ambitious goal. Join our growing team and play a pivotal role in developing applications that have a real, positive impact on people's lives. The ideal candidate is someone who thrives in a startup environment, possesses a growth mindset, and takes pride in owning their work.

**WHAT YOU‚ÄôLL DO:**

  * **Develop and Innovate:** Build APIs, REST services, and GraphQL APIs using TypeScript, Node.js, and Nest.js, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
  * **Collaborate on Solutions:** Work hand-in-hand with the product team to conceptualize and develop technology solutions. Your input will be vital in the solutioning process, from initial research to final implementation.
  * **Troubleshoot and Optimize:** Take an active role in diagnosing and resolving production issues and bugs, enhancing system reliability and performance.
  * **Drive Improvement:** Continuously suggest improvements to our architecture and design processes. Your insights will contribute to refining our development practices and product offerings.
  * **Communicate and Collaborate:** Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration. Your ability to articulate ideas and work closely with cross-functional teams will be key to our collective success.

**WHO YOU ARE:**

**Experienced Developer:** You have a solid foundation in software development, with a few years of experience, particularly in building APIs, REST services, and GraphQL APIs using TypeScript, Node.js, and Nest.js. This is not an entry-level position, but nor are we seeking someone with decades of experience; it's perfectly suited for someone ready to step into a mid-level role.

**Eager to Grow:** You're at a point in your career where you're looking to deepen your technical skills and take on more responsibility. You're not just looking for another job; you're looking for a place to grow, contribute significantly, and advance your career.

**Strategic Thinker and Doer** : You have enough experience to have formed opinions on the design and development of software solutions but are also eager to learn from others and adapt to new technologies and methodologies.

**Collaborative Team Member:** You thrive in a team environment, possess strong communication skills, and are adept at articulating technical concepts to non-technical team members. Your experience has taught you the value of collaboration and mentorship.

**Problem Solver:** You have a proven track record of diagnosing and resolving issues in production environments, demonstrating an ability to think critically and solve complex problems.

**Innovative and Proactive:** While you have an established skill set, you are always looking to improve, whether by suggesting enhancements to existing architectures or by staying abreast of the latest development practices.

**EXTRA CREDIT:**

  *     * Front-End Development: While not required, experience with front-end application development, including React, React Native, HTML, and CSS, will distinguish you as a candidate.
    * Ruby Experience: Knowledge of Ruby is also highly valued, offering additional versatility to our development team.

**SALARY:** $150,000-$160,000
