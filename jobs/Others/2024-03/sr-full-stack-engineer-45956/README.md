Our Company

  

The workplace has undergone a complete transformation. Historically, occupancy was consistent; everyone worked in-office five days per week. But post-pandemic, occupancy is inconsistent, unpredictable, and dynamic, as work has become more flexible than ever before. To make decisions with confidence, workplace, CRE, and facilities management leaders need a true understanding of how and when their spaces are used.

  

VergeSense is the company behind the worldâ€™s first and only Occupancy Intelligence Platform. Over 200 companies across 45 countries and 100M sqft rely on occupancy intelligence to make confident, fact-based optimization decisions to improve employee experience and decrease costs. VergeSense customers use our platform, which is built on a foundation of the industry's most accurate occupancy sensors, to right-size their portfolio, validate space planning and designs, optimize cleaning operations, and ensure their teams can always find spaces to work.
