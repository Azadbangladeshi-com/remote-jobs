### Job Description

What if you could use your technology skills to develop a product that impacts the way communitiesâ€™ hospitals, homes, sports stadiums, and schools across the world are built? Construction impacts the lives of nearly everyone in the world, and yet itâ€™s also one of the worldâ€™s least digitized industries, not to mention one of the most dangerous.

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re looking for an experienced **Staff Software Engineer** to join Procoreâ€™s journey to revolutionize a historically underserved industry. In this role, youâ€™ll join our highly collaborative Product and Engineering organization to drive the technical direction of our projects.

This position reports to the Software Engineering Manager and is **located in Cairo, Egypt**. Weâ€™re looking for someone to join us immediately.

 **What youâ€™ll do:**

  * Evolve our existing codebase from a monolithic Rails application into a modular system with clear, well-enforced domain boundaries and a coherent public interface
  * Participate in designing and building a system that aligns with Procoreâ€™s technical vision of a service-oriented architecture
  * Work up and down the stack to ship code for our Rails backend and our React frontend, and dive deep into the database layer to handle complex querying needs
  * Collaborate with Engineering, Product, and UX to design and build solutions that delight users and solve critical business problems
  * Serve as a leader and mentor to more junior engineers within your team 

**What we're looking for:**

  * Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science, a related field, or comparable work experience
  * 8+ years experience in Object-Oriented Program fundamentals, Test Driven Development and Design principles (Ruby on Rails, Python, C++, Java)
  * Experience designing and building software in a Service-Oriented Architecture
  * Track record of anticipating technical problems that will fall out of major projects and designing solutions to overcome those problems
  * Experience working with our stack of Ruby on Rails, React, and PostgreSQL
  * Strong experience documenting and bringing team clarity to complex solutions
  * Time-honed expertise with modern web development across the entire spectrum of development, testing, staging, deploying, and monitoring
  * A curious mind driven to innovate and solve customer problems
