From user authentication to intricate access permissions, youâ€™ll help meet the challenge of protecting our most valuable information in a considered and holistic way, all while maintaining and expanding the systems fundamental to the trust our users place in ActBlue. AAA combines a product engineering approach with defensive engineering sense to build everything from beautiful user account management features to reusable code and UX patterns for solving common authentication and authorization problems across our codebases. Collaborating closely with design, product, and other technical teams, you'll be at the forefront of developing and refining secure, accessible, and scalable
solutions. The work you do will not only safeguard our platform but also instill confidence among millions of users across the country.

Our engineering and product organization is made up of about 100 empathetic and passionate people. Weâ€™re organized into cross-functional teams that operate independently in alignment with the broader organizational goals.

#### WHAT YOU WILL DO:

  * Help set the standard for software quality on our team and the organization by writing maintainable code adaptable to future design and roadmap decisions.
  * Demonstrate profound knowledge & experience in designing and implementing Identity and Access Management solutions, ensuring our users' data is guarded while facilitating business functions.

  * Combine product and defensive engineering techniques to develop intuitive account management features and establish reusable code patterns to make security implementation straightforward and second nature for all engineers within our organization.
  * Guide the design and execution of technical solutions, prioritizing the highest impact opportunities while balancing effort, scope, and other trade-offs.
  * Partner with engineering managers to find sponsorship and growth opportunities for your colleagues.
  * Demonstrate technical leadership by writing documentation, establishing effective monitoring, and fostering clear, audience-oriented communication.
  * Coach and mentor other engineers on your team and create spaces for individuals to be engaged, valued, and heard.
  * Receive support from your manager to grow as an individual and increase your impact on the success of your team and the progressive movement.

#### WHAT YOUâ€™LL BE WORKING WITH:

  * **Frontend Development:** JavaScript with React.

#### WHAT YOU BRING:

  * 6+ years experience in development, expertise in Ruby on Rails as well as significant experience developing and maintaining server-side web applications.
  * The ability to leverage your technical expertise not just to tackle the most challenging problem in sight but to empower, teach, and build systems of support that allow others to succeed.
  * The experience of recommending system-level improvements related to security, scalability, and reliability â€“ and comfort acting as a go-to consultant for other team engineers.
  * Fluency moving between and across technical systems and stacks â€“ or at least a willingness to try. Our team focuses primarily on the back end, but a candidate for this role would ideally have experience with and an understanding of the entire technological ecosystem. 
  * Excitement for your own and your teammatesâ€™ learning and growth.
  * A track record of effective collaboration with other engineers to develop abstractions and patterns that make it easy to build reliable software.
  * Experience working closely with product and design teams to iterate on and refine product requirements, and the ability to take a long-term view when it comes to inevitable tradeoffs.
  * Eagerness to explore and refactor legacy code â€“ weâ€™ve been doing this for a while now. We could use an engineer who brings an empathetic but forward-thinking approach to working in an older codebase.
  * An understanding of and a desire to co-create systems that help build psychological safety on the team: sharing learning with others, using peer review as an opportunity to celebrate and build others up, and a willingness to practice the duality of listening and leadership.

#### OUR ENGINEERING VALUES:

  * We believe that ideas are more important than technologies.
  * We understand that the tools we build have real-world consequences for millions of people and take that responsibility seriously.
  * We know that code isnâ€™t just a set of instructions for machines but communication with other humans; style, elegance, and respect are important.
  * We believe that an ability to balance paying off technical debt and rapidly completing a project contributes to the health of the codebase, engineering team, and organization.
  * We believe that being correct isnâ€™t enough; respect for your colleagues and users is fundamental.
