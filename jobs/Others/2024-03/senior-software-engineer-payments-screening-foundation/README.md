Description

Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

 **The Community You Will Join:**

Payments is key for any healthy marketplace, and is just as central to our product at Airbnb. The Payments org at Airbnb is responsible for everything related to settling money in Airbnbâ€™s global marketplace - moving billions of dollars, in 191 countries, across 75 currencies, through a complex ecosystem of payments partners. We build technology that powers Airbnbâ€™s massive daily transaction volume to collect payments from guests, distribute payouts to hosts and everything in between. Our goal is to make the Payment experience on Airbnb as delightful, magical, intuitive, and easy as possible.

Payments Compliance is an essential part of the Payments organization. Without it, Airbnb can be subject to fines and even forbidden from conducting business in certain markets. The Screening Foundation team focuses on delivering industry-leading screening capabilities to identify and catch compliance and regulation risks, while minimizing user friction.

**The Difference You Will Make:**

We are looking for a talented, self-motivated and experienced software engineer who is excited to work in the highly dynamic and business-critical domain of Compliance. You will help us build the next generation of configurable systems to support Airbnbâ€™s entire Compliance program and scale it to ever evolving regulatory needs. The APIs, UIs, workflows and tools that you develop will implement critical controls for identification (KYC) and detection of financial crime (Sanctions/PEP/AML).

As a senior engineer, youâ€™ll also be responsible for contributing to the broader technical vision for Compliance and building alignment within engineering and cross-functional teams - all while delivering a solution that is flexible, always available, efficient, and scales with the needs of the business. Your own unique skill set, rich experiences and thought leadership will be key to success in this role.

**A Typical Day:**

  * Lead the development and refinement of systems powering compliance controls embedded in core user journeys for Airbnb hosts
  * Build the next-generation of technology stack for Compliance needs, with well defined APIs that are service-oriented, configurable and auditable
  * Work closely with Product, Design, Policy, Operations and other cross-functional partners as part of a globally distributed team, to define and ship impactful features. Present product and technical deep dives to key stakeholders.
  * Partner with other engineering teams in Airbnbâ€™s Trust and Hosting organizations to serve our users holistically
  * Lead and mentor engineers â€” both inside and outside your immediate team
  * Advocate for and participate in efforts to advance Airbnbâ€™s engineering processes and technical foundations. Drive systemic improvements by identifying patterns to streamline development, reduce toil and increase technical quality and operational excellence over time

  
**Your Expertise:**

  * 5+ years of industry engineering experience
  * BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience
  * Experience with regulatory/compliance controls is highly desirable
  * Proficiency in one or more back-end server languages (Java/Ruby/Go/C++/etc.)
  * Exposure to architectural patterns of a high-scale web and data applications
  * End-to-end ownership mentality that transcends team boundaries. Passion for building strong collaborative relationships with other engineering & product partners
  * Able to self-serve on data analysis and make data driven decisions
  * Rigorous attention to detail and the ability to tackle ambiguous problems
  * Be future looking - we might be focused on immediate regulations, but need to build for the long term
