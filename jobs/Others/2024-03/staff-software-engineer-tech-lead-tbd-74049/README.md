Description

### Company Description

Founded in July 2021, TBD is one of Block's four business units, alongside Square, Cash App, and Tidal. At TBD, we believe in a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity. Guided by this vision, TBD is building an open source platform and developer infrastructure that enables everyone to access and participate in the global economy.  
  
TBD is inviting the world to join us in building and adopting open and decentralized technologies that solve real problems for real people â€” from next generation infrastructure that lowers the cost of global payments and enables frictionless commerce, to decentralized identity technologies that enable anyone to access and participate in the global economy. Our mission advances economic empowerment through the power of decentralized solutions, built open source and collaboratively.  
  
The offerings we build will provide developers, institutions, and individuals with the capabilities needed to build the next wave of innovative apps and services, and access this decentralized future. Weâ€™re leveraging bitcoin and other decentralized technologies to reinvent the global financial system in an open and permissionless way to further Blockâ€™s mission of economic empowerment, with a global focus.

### Job Description

Our offerings provide financial and identity services to customers and partners participating in the tbDEX network. tbDEX is a protocol for discovering liquidity and exchanging assets such as fiat money, real world goods, stablecoins or bitcoin. The tbDEX protocol utilizes Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real world.
