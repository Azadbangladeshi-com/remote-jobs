### Are you ready to power the World's connections?

If you don‚Äôt think you meet all of the criteria below but are still interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks every box - we‚Äôre looking for candidates that are particularly strong in a few areas, and have some interest and capabilities in others.

### About the role:

Join our friendly, fast-moving Docs team in delivering content that helps our users succeed in their goals.

We‚Äôre an international group of writers and engineers with remote-savvy processes and tools, who pride ourselves on sharing knowledge. We own the docs site, from the foundational platform, through supporting contributions from across the company, to leading initiatives that advance our content and usability. We take the responsibility of that ownership seriously and are continuously striving to improve.

Our products are evolving and our content does as well. So, in addition to the usual tech writing tasks, we‚Äôll also take a step back to envision new content structures and new ways to present information. We aren‚Äôt afraid to tear things apart and put them back together in a completely different way.

We‚Äôre looking for a Senior Technical Writer who is excited by having a variety of projects in their queue, who is either comfortable with or wants to learn a docs-as-code delivery model, and who is ready to be an integral part of a rapidly growing company.
