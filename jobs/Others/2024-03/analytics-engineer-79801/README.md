**Job Title: Analytics Engineer**

Prompt is revolutionizing healthcare by delivering highly automated and modern software to rehab therapy businesses, the teams within, and the patients they serve. As the fastest growing company in the space and the new standard in healthcare technology, weâ€™re looking to bring on an Analytics Engineer to assist our engineering team in taking our Business Intelligence platform, data migration services, and healthcare software to the next level.

This role is truly an unprecedented opportunity to have immense impact in expanding our growth for the next chapter of Prompt. We are looking for someone who will be a foundational piece to the growth of the product, team, and strategy at Prompt.

**Why work for Prompt?**

  * BIG Challenges: Here at Prompt, we are solving complex and unique problems that have plagued the healthcare industry since the dawn of time.

  * Talented People: Prompt didn't happen by chance, it's a team of incredibly talented and proven individuals who all made their mark before joining forces to build the greatest software on the planet for rehab therapists.

  * Healthy Approach: This isn't an investment bank, we work long hours when it's needed, but at Prompt you own your workload and the entire organization takes a liking to smart work (over hard work).

  * Positive Impact: Prompt helps outpatient rehab organizations treat more patients and deliver better care with less environmental waste. That means less surgery and less narcotic-based pain treatment, all while turning a paper-heavy industry digital. We aren't enthralled with patting ourselves on the back everyday, but it does feel good :)
