### Jobber  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Canada`  

### **Are you an experienced software developer with a passion for finding creative solutions to real-world problems? Do you love supporting more junior team members in their learning process?**

Then Jobber might be the place for you! We're looking for a **Senior Software Engineer** to be part of our Software Engineering team.

At Jobber, we donâ€™t just build a product - we work on real problems that help people in small businesses to become successful. We are inspired by our company values: be humble, be supportive and give a shit, which is not just said but are lived. We work in a collaborative environment where teams make decisions with autonomy and contribute directly to shaping the companyâ€™s future. We release early and often while dedicating time to addressing technical debt. We believe in getting instant feedback from our customers and leveraging that to make their lives easier.

We help employees grow professionally; we have a ton of onboarding resources, tutorials, hackathons, and buddies to support learnings and provide opportunities to innovate. We have a range of experience levels on teams which allow for mentor/mentee opportunities. Leaders at Jobber work with empathy and support employees to build a healthy work-life harmony. Bring your dedication and passion to this job to fulfill your goals.

### The team:

Our Software Engineering team is central to the success of Jobber - focused on creating software that delivers value to tens of thousands of users around the world. This team focuses on enabling reliable and compliant communication features that build trust between our customers and theirs!

At Jobber we never stop growing and learning, and you shouldnâ€™t either. Through continuous 1:1s, dedicated feedback and support from your manager and our Learning and Development team, and your own sense of curiosity, we hope you develop to another level with your skill set.

### The role:

Reporting to the Manager, Software Engineering, the **Senior Software Engineer** will collaborate with other Software Development members on a Scrum team to build an industry-leading product that helps our customers and their small businesses be successful. Weâ€™re looking for people who are ready to solve problems that millions of entrepreneurs are facing, using their experience to influence both a product and our team, all the while still working on developing their own craft.

In this role, itâ€™s important that youâ€™re a champion of best practices for well-tested, scalable, and well-organized code. In addition, you customize and extend tools and processes to increase the effectiveness of your team, and mentor others to do the same.

As a **Senior Software Engineer,** you will:

  * Be involved in the full life-cycle of a feature, from ideation to delivery and adoption
  * Be responsive and proactive to emerging changes to communication regulations and requirements across the industry
  * Build resilient, fault-tolerant systems systems that keep all of Jobberâ€™s communications flowing, and lower the barrier to other developers to develop comms features
  * Participate in code review and testing, while driving engineering solutions to have consistent practices and reusable code
  * Facilitate group discussions with team members and stakeholders to determine the best solution to our customer's problems
  * Research, communicate, and advocate for the use of best practices within your teamâ€™s domain
  * Mentor and coach junior teammates, helping them elevate their skills and careers
  * Understand how and why our customers work the way they do, so you can develop and improve features in Jobber's online and mobile apps

### To be successful, you should have:

  * A demonstrated level of senior software engineering experience on a full stack development team
  * Experience with the entire software development lifecycle in the Agile/Scrum framework
  * Experience using Ruby on Rails in a production environment
  * A strong systems focus, on building foundational software for large at-scale applications
  * Backend focused mindset: building systems resilient to disruption
  * Ability to quickly move between different features and projects with a strong interest in experimentation
  * Enthusiasm for delivering value early and often to customers
  * A structured understanding of common full stack frameworks, architectures, technologies and patterns
  * An inquisitive mind set; ability to ask a lot of questions, seek out new information and remain open to new ideas and perspectives.
  * The ability to self serve, take initiative and find resources necessary to accomplish a project or solve a problem.
  * Experience providing technical mentorship and sharing industry best practices, helping team members navigate complex engineering challenges and stay involved with the latest technologies and trends.

**It would be really great (but not a deal-breaker) if you had:**

  * Contributed to backbone comms systems that have scaled to handle hundreds of thousands of customers
  * Experience with Twilio, Sendgrid, Vonage or other cPaaS companies
  * Experience working with 10DLC or other telecommunication standards
  * Experience working in close contact with internal and external success and support teams
  * Experience working on teams that provide internal platform specific tools to other developers
