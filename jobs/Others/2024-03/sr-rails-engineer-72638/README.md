**Who we are**

HopSkipDriveâ€™s mission is to create opportunity for all through mobility. Our innovative, supplemental school transportation solutions are used by over 400 school districts, charter schools, nonprofits, government agencies, as well as busy families to safely and reliably get kids where they need to go.

Student transportation is the largest mass transit system in the U.S. The way kids get to and from school has a direct impact on our kids, families, schools and communities. While school districts spend $28 billion annually on transportation, only 30% of kids get to school on a bus. The current system can no longer meet all the transportation needs of our districts, schools and families â€” and its shortcomings are causing inequities in educational access that are affecting the welfare of millions of kids each day.

HopSkipDrive is taking a different approach to arranging safe, reliable school transportation that meets needs that arenâ€™t being addressed by the current system, helping to fill gaps and supplement the student transportation options available. We create personalized transportation solutions for the one to the many, and everything in between.

**Weâ€™re a company with heart** **  
** **  
**Our partnerships with school districts, child welfare agencies and nonprofits ensure equitable educational access for the most vulnerable populations, including youth in foster care, children experiencing homelessness and students with disabilities.

We understand that the difference between struggle and success can sometimes be as simple as the ability to show up, which is why weâ€™re on a mission to use innovative technology â€” coupled with operational expertise and new ways of thinking â€” to help kids reach their full potential by providing a safe, dependable way to get them where they are going.

**Weâ€™re an awesome place to work** **  
** **  
**Our company culture has been well-recognized â€” HopSkipDrive has been named to Fast Companyâ€™s Most Innovative Companies list, as well as Best Places to Work lists from Built In LA, Comparably, Inc., and the Los Angeles Business Journal. Comparably also named us a Best Company for Professional Development, as well as to its Best CEO and Best CEOs for Women lists.

**Weâ€™re growing rapidly** **  
** **  
**Founded by three moms as a solution to their own transportation challenges, we now operate across over 20 major markets and more than a dozen states across the country. We continue to expand at a rapid pace, making the Inc. 5000 list four times, as well as the Deloitte 500 Fast-Growing Technology list. HopSkipDrive has raised $100M in funding to date.

The Senior Rails Engineer should be seen as an experienced software engineer who is a master of Ruby, Rails, and web development in general. The Senior Engineer is capable of owning technical design for projects of moderate complexity, and understands the tradeoffs in creating good software. They hold a depth of knowledge in systems that enables them to debug those systems effectively without flailing.

The Senior Engineer gets a lot done. They are responsible for complex tasks and complete them despite roadblocks, grabbing others for help or insight as necessary. The Senior Engineer requires very little oversight beyond high-level direction; they can take a complex user story, break it down into sub-tasks, and complete their sub-tasks with relative ease. The Senior Engineer shows initiative beyond knocking tasks off a list; they are able to identify and suggest areas of future work for themselves or their teams.
