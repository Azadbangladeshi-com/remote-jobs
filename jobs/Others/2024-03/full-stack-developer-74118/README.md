GroupCollect is a suite of tools that lets tour operators handle group travel, especially for students.  

We are a bootstrapped company operating in a niche market which we think is underserved. We want to make tools these folks love and rely on, whether theyâ€™re devising a trip, selling it to a school, getting travelers registered, collecting payments, or anything else. Tour operators put a lot of trust in us and we donâ€™t take that responsibility lightly.  
  

We believe that diversity and inclusion among our teammates are critical to our success as a company. We are looking for talented people from the widest range of backgrounds.

  

#  **Who weâ€™re looking for**

  * Weâ€™re looking for full stack software engineers who have at least 3 years of experience using Elixir & Phoenix or Ruby & Rails.
  * We need folks who are comfortable working fully remote in the UTC-6/UTC+3 time zones.
  * While we are remote, we are not asynchronous. The hours you work are expected to overlap with US Eastern Time for 3-4 hours on most days.
  * We expect you to be great at listening and asking questions, a good communicator with solid (but by no means native) English skills.
  * You should be independent and self directed but humble enough to reach out and ask for help.
  * You should care a lot about the quality of products you make, not just the quality of the codebase.

  

#  **What weâ€™re offerin** g

  * 110K-150K USD/year depending on your experience
  * Generous benefits for US employees
  * We offer a 401(k) matching plan where GroupCollect, LLC matches 100% of your contributions up to 3% of your salary, and then 50% of your contributions on the next 2% of your salary.
  * Flexible Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA): more affordable than traditional group health plans, personalized to suit your unique healthcare needs, and nontaxable.
  * Ample paid time off: 30 days per year for international contractors; 20 days per year + 10 legal holidays for US employees (though you can trade legal holidays for days off if you want)
  * Unlimited paid sick leave
  * The latest and greatest MacBook Pro
  * $500/year reimbursement for any books, videos or courses you wish to purchase.

  

# **What itâ€™s like to work with us**

We are a bootstrapped company with a small and nimble crew. While we care a lot about our customers, we put our team first.

  * Youâ€™ll work in a relaxed, informal atmosphere which lets you focus on your work without getting in the way.
  * Weâ€™re not heavy on management, process or meetings. While we find that some structure and planning help, we donâ€™t overdo it.
  * We care about a healthy work-life balance. You wonâ€™t be working more than 40 hours a week except during the rarest of emergencies.

  

# **How we work**

We feel like job posts and interviews sometimes make it hard to know what youâ€™re signing up for. So weâ€™d like to go into a bit of detail here:

  * We use bi-weekly cycles to plan our work, but we donâ€™t ascribe to SCRUM or any other rigid agile process.
  * We do a daily standup with our peers Mon-Thu, a weekly meeting with the entire team on Monday.
  * You will always find a few hours in the day to focus on your work.
  * We ship our work multiple times a day.
  * Fridays are usually reserved for code cleanup, quality of life improvements, etc.
  * We expect you to write tests, but we donâ€™t ascribe to TDD or expect 100% code coverage. We see tests as a way to ensure we wonâ€™t let our customers down.
  * We have a few full-stack monolithic web apps that interface with each other using webhooks and APIs. We donâ€™t do single page apps or microservices.
  * We host on PaaS platforms. We donâ€™t care if youâ€™ve never heard of Kubernetes beforeâ€“and weâ€™re here for you if you never want to hear about it again.
  * We do a weekly rotation in dealing with bugs and exceptions. But because we are serious about testing (and a globally distributed team) nobodyâ€™s going to wake you up in the middle of the night.
  * Work stays at work: we donâ€™t expect you to have Slack on your phone or answer email during your off hours.

  

# **Our hiring process**

Because weâ€™re a small team and we donâ€™t hire a lot, our hiring process is lengthier than some others. While we understand this might be an imposition, we try to be flexible and accommodating throughout this process. The lengthiest part is a paid take-home test.

  
Step 1: As part of this application we will ask you to:

  * submit your resume (a document, URL, or Linkedin profile)
  * submit a code sample: preferably a single file we can review carefully that showcases your skills as a developer.
  * fill out a short, five-question questionnaire

  
Step 2: If we choose to move forward, we will follow up with a quick 30-minute non-technical call where we can learn about each other.

  
Step 3: If we move forward from there, we will follow up with a one-hour technical interview.

  * Donâ€™t worry, we wonâ€™t ask you to implement algorithms on a whiteboard. 
  * Weâ€™ll ask you how you would implement some of the features weâ€™ve shipped in the past. 
  * We will also ask your opinion on some technology and industry practices and how you feel about them
  * This is a chance to learn about each other and see how we each approach our work.

  
Step 4: Finally, if we move forward from here we will ask you to work on a 20-hour paid take home project.

  * Applicants that complete the take home test will receive $1,000.
  * You can choose how you want to schedule it: half-time work for a week, 3 days of deep focus, stretch it out over two weeks, etc. If youâ€™ve made it this far, we can be flexible and will accommodate you.
  * We would like to meet with you once or twice during this take home test; this lets you and us ask follow up questions and dig into some details.

  
At the end of this process, we should both feel like we know each other pretty well and know whether we want to work together  
  

# **Diversity and inclusion**

GroupCollect is an equal-opportunity employer. We are committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment.

  

We do not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor.
