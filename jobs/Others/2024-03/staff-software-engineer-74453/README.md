Themis is democratizing governance and risk to make it work for companies rather than against them. We are solving the communication gap experienced by most companies that exist between internal departments and external partners by creating simple, intuitive software to monitor and share governance related controls.

###  **Culture**

  * Governance and risk is not a traditionally exciting space however the Themis founding team have a history together which makes building the product fun and approachable.

  * By default we believe in people and give them every opportunity to grow. We believe Themis will succeed when team members are given autonomy to solve problems creatively.

  * We encourage people to research and leverage innovative tools that can be applied to a traditionally sleepy industry.

  * We are focused on speed and quality and are not afraid to cut scope to uphold our standards. To achieve these standards we use modern tools with minimal process and focus on the problems of the day.

  * And most importantly, we want you to bring your personality to work and have fun!
