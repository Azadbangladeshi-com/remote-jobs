### Coinbase  
#### `üåé Remote - India`  

At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn‚Äôt do this without hiring the best people. We‚Äôre a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they‚Äôre trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That‚Äôs us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We‚Äôre a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

**Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:**

  * You‚Äôve got positive energy. You‚Äôre optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
  * You‚Äôre never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
  * You appreciate direct communication. You‚Äôre both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let‚Äôs face it, you can‚Äôt have one without the other. You‚Äôre cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
  * You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You‚Äôre not looking for a boring job.
  * You have a ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn‚Äôt scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
  * You want to be part of a winning team. We‚Äôre stronger together, and you‚Äôre a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.
