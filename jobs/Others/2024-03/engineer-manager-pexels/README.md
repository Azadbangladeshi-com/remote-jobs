### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but we have a swanky new office in London that has all the bells and whistles. Even though you'll find us in Shoreditch, you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales, change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Working with designers and product managers to scope out new features, functionality, and technical requirements.
  * Proposing and implementing innovative approaches and solutions to ensure we future-proof features.
  * Participating in code review processes, as a code author and a reviewer.
  * Coach, lead, and mentor your team to help them achieve their goals.
  * Perform structured performance reviews with your team members, conduct regular 1:1s, participate in the hiring process of new engineers, and plan goals & milestones for your team.
  * Foster a positive and productive work environment by promoting collaboration, open communication, and continuous learning and development opportunities for your team.

### You're probably a match if

  * You have a proven record of crafting high-performance commercial software in Ruby for large-scale global projects.
  * You are grounded in computer science and engineering fundamentals, including concurrency, multithreading, data structures, solution design, architecture, and design patterns.
  * You are confident in your verbal and written communication skills for leading technical and non-technical conversations with colleagues.
  * You have several years of experience in people management, leading and mentoring other software engineers. Providing mentorship to others is close to your heart, and you thrive by empowering others.
  * You have a strong sense of ownership and are eager to find and develop novel solutions to challenging problems proactively.
  * You are a strong communicator and a team player and are eager to work together with your colleagues to brainstorm ideas.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.
