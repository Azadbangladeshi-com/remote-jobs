### Job Description

â€‹â€‹What if you could use your technology skills to develop a product that impacts the way communitiesâ€™ hospitals, homes, sports stadiums, and schools across the world are built? Construction impacts the lives of nearly everyone in the world, and yet itâ€™s also one of the worldâ€™s least digitized industries, not to mention one of the most dangerous. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re looking for a talented Staff Full-Stack Software Engineer to join Procoreâ€™s journey to revolutionize a historically underserved industry.

As a **Staff Software Engineer** at Procore, youâ€™re given the unique opportunity to partner intimately with our customer base, translating their fundamental needs into technological SaaS solutions. Backed by the might of our teams, weâ€™ll provide you with the tools and resources needed to achieve extraordinary results that render a significant impact extending beyond the boundaries of traditional engineering roles.

This position will report into the Senior Engineering Manager for the Construction Documents Group with the opportunity to be located in the Czech Republic. Weâ€™re looking for someone to join our team immediately.

**What youâ€™ll do:**

  * Help establish standards for development teams and collaborate on initiatives with infrastructure, platform, and other software engineering teams
  * Assist fellow teammates by conducting code reviews and pairing
  * Leverage our tech stack: Primarily Java/React/Postgres hosted on AWS and increasingly using Kubernetes, CircleCI for Continuous Integration, and a combination of ArgoCD and an in-house tool for CD.
  * Drive critical projects, including: 
    * Scalability: Weâ€™re scaling and need engineers who are ready to take on the challenge of working on live, core systems with millions of users
    * Complex data management systems: Weâ€™re building a world-class document file management system. Youâ€™ll work through challenges like file intake, document management, large file manipulations, permissions and file revisioning.
    * Evolve our existing codebase from a monolithic Rails application into a modular system with clear, well-enforced domain boundaries and a coherent public interface
    * Participate in designing and building a system that is aligned with Procoreâ€™s technical vision of a Service-Oriented Architecture
    * Build, maintain, and develop a wide series of microservices and are looking for engineers adept at discovering new opportunities and driving them to completion.

 **What we're looking for:**

  * Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience
  * Professional experience with Java, Spring Boot, React and Ruby
  * 8+ years experience in software engineering fundamentals, Test Driven Development and Design principles
  * Experience with working on Document Management systems
  * Understanding the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term goals and balancing immediate needs with strategic initiatives
  * Experience in working with software, platforms, and infrastructure at scale (we run thousands of hosts and have millions of users) 
  * Experience in building modern Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery systems at scale
  * Experience working with a team on large initiatives with the ability to course-correct as needed
  * Experience working with modern web development, including testing, staging, deploying, and monitoring
