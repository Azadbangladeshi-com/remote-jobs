Description

### Company Description

 **About Shopify**

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. Since 2006, we‚Äôve grown to over 10,000 employees and generated over $500 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. Every 28 seconds, an entrepreneur on Shopify makes their first sale.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts people‚Äôs lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

 **About you**  
  
Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity‚Äîand a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:

  * Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
  * Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
  * Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
  * Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
  * Bring critical thought and opinion ‚Äî and embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
  * Work digital-first for your daily work

### Job Description

At Shopify, Senior Infrastructure Engineers use their expertise and passion to multiply their overall output. As a part of a team, you will design and build technically innovative solutions that empower all teams at Shopify to build powerful and resilient distributed cloud software. Merchants that depend on Shopify for a highly scalable, performant, and reliable platform benefit directly from the work you do. You will maintain a high bar for quality and mentor other engineers. And of course, you‚Äôll be hands-on in the code and contribute technically.

There are multiple positions available on a variety of teams and we will work with you as part of the interview process to identify which team best fits your interests, needs and experience.

Here is a sampling of some of the teams, systems and projects to which you could contribute. Note: by choosing to apply to this posting, you will be matched to a specific infrastructure team after your interview process.

Examples of the exciting work happening in Infrastructure:

  * Build routing infrastructure to facilitate resilient and performant North-South and East-West communication
  * Build and enhance large fleets of compute infrastructure like Kubernetes clusters and server-less compute to host our commerce apps along with a robust and flexible VPC architecture to enable a geographically distributed resilient network fabric and advanced ebpf-based telemetry for observability.
  * Expand the reach of our search systems to standardize the way we index documents in different languages and in various locations around the world
  * Scale a team looking at solving issues with shopping cart access, configuration plane information and package tracking data using a globally accessible, high write key/value store
  * Grow the capacity of our worldwide distributed site reliability engineering teams, consulting with other engineering groups on how to build low latency, highly resilient systems
  * Take our observability systems to the next level, expanding and evangelizing the usage of tracing, metrics and structured logging across the company 
  * Work on expanding our highly scalable and configurable job system to support all of the applications on the platform
  * Keep our databases operating optimally using proxies, load shedding, custom routing layers and application transparent sharding
  * Build manipulation primitives such as combination and filtering into our streaming infrastructure to allow teams to translate existing data streams into specific business problems

### Qualifications

Experience and skills that are important for success in these role:

  * Experience with service discovery and service communication
  * A proven track record of success in solving software development problems ‚Äî technical mentorship is a must
  * Deep experience building large scale, high throughput distributed systems and scaling web services, particularly those using and analyzing large amounts of data
  * The ability to write high quality code in a high level programming language (e.g. Go, Ruby, Java)
  * Experience with Site Reliability engineering/ DevOps practices.
  * Experience leading the architecture and automation of infrastructure within a cloud environment.
  * Experience deploying and monitoring a production system at scale in a cloud native environment.
  * A track record of being a self-starter and a team player keen on mentoring others and growing your own skill set within a fast paced environment.
  * Experience working on a remote or distributed engineering team.
  * A commitment and drive for quality, technical excellence and results
  * Building services and deploying them on top of Kubernetes and/or Google Cloud Platform
  * Participating in an on call rotation and/or site reliability engineering (SRE) experience
