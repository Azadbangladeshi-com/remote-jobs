# [Software Engineer - Americas Team](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-americas-team)  
### Discourse  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Americas`  

**_Salary dependent on location and experience. Happy to provide a number up front based on resume._**

Software Engineers at Discourse are generalists. Some days you may be working on a complex JavaScript feature implemented in Ember.js. Other days you may be working on our Ruby on Rails API server. Some days you may be contributing patches to frameworks or working on one of the many gems and libraries Discourse maintains.

The majority of the work you will do will be open source.

Discourse is primarily a hosting company: some of your focus will be around improving our hosting infrastructure, resolving issues for customers, or assisting with customer-specific implementations and migrations.

Applicants will have a 10-40 hour paid trial project (over 2-10 weeks) prior to joining the team. The trial project usually involves adding a feature to Discourse or a Discourse plugin.

About the job

Your responsibilities will include:

  * Designing, developing and documenting features for Discourse

  * Correcting bugs in Discourse

  * Developing and maintaining supporting infrastructure software

  * Developing software that assist in migrations, customer specific plugins and other areas

  * Documenting and clearly communicating fixes and features requests that are completed

  * Assisting with pre-sales, support and operations as needed

Weâ€™re looking for someone who:

  * Has Ruby and JavaScript experience

  * Is passionate about open source and comfortable with public code reviews

  * Has a knack for implementing processes, technologies, and solutions for a fast-paced environment.

At Discourse, the ability to communicate well in writing is paramount. We use our own software, Discourse, for most communication and most of your interaction with customers and team members will be in writing. In order to live these values, we look for folks who are:

  * Detail-oriented, proactive, and organized

  * Able to make decisions quickly and communicate effectively

  * Work well independently and remotely

  * Kind to their co-workers

  * Highly driven with an execution focus and a strong belief in our mission to make the internet a better place

  * While not a necessity, prior experience with open source software or community management is an advantage

About our Pay & Benefits

We believe that high-quality benefits make our team more effective. Weâ€™ve been thoughtful about our benefits package which includes a completely flexible schedule, 5 weeks of vacation per year, funding for a co-working stipend, and much more!

Our Salary Framework is location and experience based, and weâ€™re happy to provide a range up front. We also give every employee a stake in the success of the business, regardless of seniority or role. All full-time employees are eligible to receive equity options in the company as part of our equity incentive program.

Lastly, we believe in having a welcoming workplace where people with diverse backgrounds and cultures can create something great together. We encourage you to apply, even if you donâ€™t meet every qualification! Apply by sending a cover letter and resume to jobs@discourse.org.
