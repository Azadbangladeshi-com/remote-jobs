Description

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alexandra Sunderland, Director of Engineering at Fellow, and Iâ€™m looking to hire senior full stack software engineers to join our mission of making meetings effective for everyone. At Fellow, youâ€™ll get to work on a team thatâ€™s passionate about learning, helping each other out, and producing high quality products and code at the intersection of meeting productivity and AI.

  

We're hiring remotely, but have offices and co-working spaces available throughout Canada in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto where you can pop in to work with other team members if you want some in-person time!

  

  

Key Responsibilities

  

  * Build across the entire stack of our application. We use React/Typescript, Django/Python, Relay/GraphQL, and more.
  * Constantly experimenting and building with new AI technologies, and LLMs, and discovering ways to use them to improve the Meeting experience.
  * Work directly with our team of designers, product leads, and QA analysts to create intuitive interfaces and great experiences.
  * Collaborate closely with teammates to build new features and participate in constructive code reviews.
  * Contribute to our CI pipeline by writing unit tests, regression tests, and integration tests for your code.
  * Always be learning from each other and contributing back to the team.  

  * Write and contribute to technical specs, define and monitor release metrics.
  * Work with product, design, and engineering leaders to scope, break down, and build projects.
  * Promote engineering best practices to the team, and lead the way in adopting new technologies and methodologies.

  

  

Ideal candidates

  

  * Experience building web applications (for example, with Django, Ruby on Rails, Node.js...).
  * Excited to bring ideas to the table, and eager to learn.  

  * Enjoy having top-to-bottom ownership of new features, including crafting technical specs, writing readable and extensible code, and keeping tabs on post-release metrics.
  * Have 5+ years of programming experience (this can include personal projects, internships, co-ops, or anything you think is relevant).

  

  

Engineering at Fellow

  

We ship projects quickly: Build cycles are 8 weeks long, during which your focus is on your project. No weekly sprint planning meetings here! A great deal of care is put into breaking down projects to fit into the cycle while allowing for proper QA process, thorough code review throughout, and written tests. Our CI pipeline, linting, thoughtfully designed code structure, and strong partnerships with the product team allow for us to keep this velocity while maintaining exceptionally high code quality.

  

We care a lot about the engineering community: Many members of the team are strong contributors to OSS, publish blog posts with software tutorials, and speak at conferences and local meetups.
