### Company Description

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldnâ€™t work together.  
  
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions â€“ to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, weâ€™ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  
  
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes â€“ large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. Weâ€™re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

### Job Description

Square Bank Accounts save and store money into our popular Checking and Savings products, used by hundreds of thousands of merchants every month. Our team focuses on making these products delightful to use, while building in ways that enable future use cases easily.

When our merchants make a sale, the Square Bank Accounts team helps them manage their business finances by ensuring instant access to sales revenue and directly providing banking tools, including bank account numbers and mobile check deposits. Our team and product integrate with other Square cash flow tools, including Payments, Square Debit Card, Loans, Instant Transfers, Bill Pay, Payroll, financial reporting, and more. This suite of products ensures that our customers can always understand and control where their money is going. We partner with platform and infrastructure teams to move billions of dollars each year on behalf of our merchants.

Where Checking enables merchants to pay for expenses in the shorter term, Square Savings makes it easy for sellers to save money, organize their funds, and plan for the longer term, whether itâ€™s paying taxes or buying new equipment. Automated savings has been a hit with merchants and weâ€™re looking to make it a more delightful experience for merchants while scaling its impact across our merchant base.

We are a product-focused engineering team with a full-stack background. Our projects use data-driven decisions to deliver features across mobile and web front-ends. We also talk directly to merchants about their needs to identify opportunities to improve their experience. Our team works together closely to contribute to meaningful work seen by millions of merchants worldwide. As a team lead, you'll focus on building entirely new backend systems to power new Bank Accounts offerings at a significant scale. Best of all, youâ€™ll get to do so alongside a supportive team that will facilitate your growth (ask for our Pulse scores!).
