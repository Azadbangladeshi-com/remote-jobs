### WHO WE ARE:

ActBlue is a nonprofit that builds tech and infrastructure for Democratic campaigns, progressive-aligned causes, and people trying to make an impact in order to fuel long-term, people-powered chage. If youâ€™ve ever given online to a Democrat or progressive organization, chances are youâ€™ve used our powerful online fundraising platform.

We put power in the hands of small-dollar donors and help thousands of groups â€” from presidential candidates to environmental organizations â€” build grassroots movements. We envision a democracy where everyone looking to make progressive people-powered change can easily and effectively deploy their resources, energy, and creativity to shape our country and futures. Each and every one of us, from the political activists to the tech innovators to the customer service pros, is fully committed to our mission.

### THE OPPORTUNITY:

We are looking for a Staff Data Engineer to join ActBlueâ€™s Data Department and support the growth of our platform.

The Data Product team is a new team whose mission is to integrate our internal data platform into our user-facing products. The team will work on projects from data streaming to ML, all with the end goal of unlocking the value of our data to better serve political entities and donors.

### WHAT YOU WILL DO:

  * Work with other engineering teams to create and optimize our data infrastructure and tooling.
  * Work with data scientists to implement a production-level Machine Learning platform.
  * Work with application developers and database administrators to create the infrastructure needed for high-performance data insights in our applications.

### WHAT YOU BRING:

  * At least 7 years of experience in data engineering or related roles.
  * Experience implementing both real-time data products and production ML systems.
  * Experience maintaining and deploying server-side web applications.
  * A team player mentality: you keep the end user in mind and enjoy hearing feedback from your teammates, but you know when and how to defend your own ideas in a respectful manner.
  * Comfort collaborating with a distributed team of many remote colleagues.
  * An inclusive, generous working style: You like to mentor, collaborate, and elevate your team by supporting your peers.
  * Excitement for the learning and growth of yourself and your teammates.
  * An understanding of performance, scalability, and security concerns.

### BONUS POINTS IFâ€¦

  * Youâ€™ve worked with ML platforms such as Sagemaker, Tensorflow, and Modelbit
  * Youâ€™ve worked with real time analytics platforms such as Clickhouse, Rockset, and Timescale

  * Tooling: Looker, dbt, Github, PagerDuty, DataDog, Fivetran, Hightouch
  * Hosting: AWS
  * Databases: Redshift, PostgreSQL

### OUR ENGINEERING VALUES:

  * We believe that ideas are more important than technologies.
  * We understand that the tools we build have real-world consequences for millions of people and take that responsibility seriously.
  * Security is at the center of everything we do. We are always on the lookout for ways to further harden our platform.
  * We know that code isnâ€™t just a set of instructions for machines, but communication with other humans; style, elegance, and respect are important.
  * We believe that an ability to balance paying off technical debt and rapidly completing a project contributes to the health of the codebase, engineering team, and organization.
  * We believe that being correct isnâ€™t enough; respect for your colleagues and users is fundamental.
