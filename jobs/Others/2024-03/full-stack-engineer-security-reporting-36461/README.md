### Who we are

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

In this role, you would join Stripe's Vulnerability Management team. Our vision is to create a culture of continuous excellence in managing vulnerabilities. We want to enhance customer trust by giving users context about threats and vulnerabilities affecting Stripe's systems. We aim to be a key partner in Stripe's risk management by providing visibility into vulnerabilities across Stripe's products and services.

### What youâ€™ll do

As a Software Engineer on the Vulnerability Management team, youâ€™ll play a pivotal role in scaling our efforts to ensure security is baked into everything we build and maintain at Stripe. Youâ€™ll help to create the internal tools and interfaces to clearly communicate and display Stripeâ€™s security posture using data from our security data pipeline. Working on such a platform, youâ€™ll be enabling our product engineering teams to take action and business leaders to consider how to reduce risks to their products and systems.

While prior experience with Security is definitely a plus, it's not a requirement for this role. So if you're eager to jump into a new challenge and gain experience in Security, this could be the perfect opportunity for you!

### Responsibilities

  * Build intuitive web applications using modern frameworks.
  * Design, build, and maintain APIs, services, and data-flows.
  * Build new features for internal users.
  * Participate in the product development process from start to finish, from helping scope projects to measuring their success and iterating based on user feedback.
  * Iterate new versions of our Security Posture Dashboard and find efficient ways to scale our security metric pipeline.
  * Uphold best practices in engineering and design.

###  **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### Minimum requirements

  * 2+ years of industry experience doing full stack web development with a strong background in frontend 

### **Preferred qualifications**

  *     * Previous experience with security is beneficial, but not required
    * Find industry-leading security and privacy engineering interesting
    * Seek out opportunities for impact and can execute in a complex environment
    * Are comfortable working across the stack, and have strong full stack experience building modern web applications and data backends; we work mostly with JavaScript (React), Ruby, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS. We arenâ€™t experts in all of these technologies, and we donâ€™t expect you to be either
    * Experience with frontend design
    * Take pride in shepherding projects from ideation through to completion, where completion often involves partnering with engineering teams to carefully roll out changes that affect their workflows
    * Actively seek feedback from your users and advocate for them throughout the product development process
    * Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different functions and stakeholders
