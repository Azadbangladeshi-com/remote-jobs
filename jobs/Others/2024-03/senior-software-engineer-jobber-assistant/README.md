At Jobber, we donâ€™t just build a product - we work on real problems that help people in small businesses to become successful. We are inspired by our company values: be humble, be supportive and give a shit, which is not just said but are lived. We work in a collaborative environment where teams make decisions with autonomy and contribute directly to shaping the companyâ€™s future.

At Jobber we never stop growing and learning, and you shouldnâ€™t either. Through continuous 1:1s, dedicated feedback and support from your manager and our Learning and Development team, and your own sense of curiosity, we hope you develop to another level with your skill set.

### The role:

Reporting to the Manager, Software Engineering, the **Senior Software Engineer** will collaborate with other Software Development members on a Scrum team to build an industry-leading product that helps our customers and their small businesses be successful. Weâ€™re looking for people who are ready to solve problems that millions of entrepreneurs are facing, using their experience to influence both a product and our team, all the while still working on developing their own craft.

In this role, itâ€™s important that youâ€™re a champion of best practices for well-tested, scalable, and well-organized code. In addition, you customize and extend tools and processes to increase the effectiveness of your team, and mentor others to do the same.

  * Be involved in the full life-cycle of a feature, from ideation to delivery and adoption
  * Bring large-language models/ChatGPT into Jobber. 
  * Participate in code review and testing, while driving engineering solutions to have consistent practices and reusable code
  * Facilitate group discussions with team members and stakeholders to determine the best solution to our customer's problems
  * Research, communicate, and advocate for the use of best practices within your teamâ€™s domain
  * Mentor and coach junior teammates, helping them elevate their skills and careers
  * Understand how and why our customers work the way they do, so you can develop and improve features in Jobber's online and mobile apps

### To be successful, you should have:

  * A demonstrated level of senior software engineering experience on a full stack development team
  * Experience with the entire software development lifecycle in the Agile/Scrum framework
  * Experience using Ruby on Rails in a production environment
  * A strong interest in AI/ML and building integrated software for large at-scale applications

  * Ability to quickly move between different features and projects with a strong interest in experimentation
  * Enthusiasm for delivering value early and often to customers
  * A structured understanding of common full stack frameworks, architectures, technologies and patterns
  * An inquisitive mind set; ability to ask a lot of questions, seek out new information and remain open to new ideas and perspectives.
  * The ability to self serve, take initiative and find resources necessary to accomplish a project or solve a problem.
  * Experience providing technical mentorship and sharing industry best practices, helping team members navigate complex engineering challenges and stay involved with the latest technologies and trends.

**It would be really great (but not a deal-breaker) if you had:**

  * Experience using Rockset (real-time analytics database)
  * Experience with front-end Javascript frameworks/libraries such as React
  * Experience creating and consuming GraphQL APIs
  * Experience with technologies like Redis and Elasticsearch
