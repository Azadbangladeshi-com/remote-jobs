#### `ðŸŒŽ Canada`  

### **Do you want to develop more than just a product?**

Then Jobber might be the place for you! Weâ€™re looking for a **Staff Software Engineer** to be part of our growing team.

Jobber exists to help people in small businesses be successful. We work with small home service businesses, like your local plumbers, painters, and landscapers, to transform the way service is delivered through technology. With Jobber they can quote, schedule, invoice, and collect payments from their customers, while providing an easy and professional customer experience. Running a small business today isnâ€™t like it used to beâ€”the way we consume and deliver service is changing rapidly, technology is evolving, and customers expect more. Thatâ€™s why we put the power and flexibility in their hands to run their businesses how, where, and when they want!

Our culture of transparency, inclusivity, collaboration, and innovation has been recognized by Great Place to Work, Canadaâ€™s Most Admired Corporate Cultures, and more. Jobber has also been named on the Globe and Mailâ€™s Canadaâ€™s Top Growing Companies list, and Deloitte Canadaâ€™s Technology Fast 50â„¢, Enterprise Fast 15, and Technology Fast 500â„¢ lists. With an Executive team that has over thirty years of industry experience of leading the way, weâ€™ve come a long way from our first customer in 2011â€”but weâ€™ve just scratched the surface of what we want to accomplish for our customers.

We help our employees grow professionally; we have a ton of onboarding resources, tutorials, hackathons and buddies to support learnings and provide opportunities to innovate. We have a range of experience levels on teams which allow for mentor/mentee opportunities. Leaders at Jobber work with empathy and support employees to build a healthy work-life harmony. Bring your dedication and passion to this job to fulfill your goals.

### The team:

Our Software Engineering team is central to the success of Jobber - focused on creating software that delivers value to tens of thousands of users around the world. This team owns core workflows that make it easier for our customers to set up and manage their scheduled work.

At Jobber we never stop growing and learning, and you shouldnâ€™t either. Through continuous 1:1s, dedicated feedback and support from your manager and our Learning and Development team, and your own sense of curiosity, we hope you develop to another level with your skill set.

### The role:

Reporting to the Senior Manager, Software Engineering, the **Staff Software Engineer** will be a technical leader within our Product Software Engineering team, working with scrum teams to build an industry leading product that helps our customers and their small businesses be successful. Weâ€™re looking for people who are ready to solve problems that millions of entrepreneurs are facing, using their experience to influence both a product and our team, all the while still working on developing their own craft.

It's important that you can lead by example, influence decision-making, effectively handle conflict, and be a champion for engineering best practice for well-tested, scalable, and well-organized code.

As a **Staff Software Engineer,** you will:

  * Be involved in the full development life-cycle of a feature, from ideation to delivery and adoption
  * Understand how and why our customers work the way they do, so you can develop and improve features in Jobber's online and mobile apps.
  * Deliver high quality and well-structured code and mentor teammates to do the same
  * Identify, advocate for, and lead cross-team technical initiatives
  * Participate in code review and testing, while driving engineering solutions to have consistent practices and reusable code
  * Facilitate group discussions with team members and stakeholders to determine the best solution to our customerâ€™s problems
  * Research, communicate, and advocate for the use of best practices within your teamâ€™s domain
  * Breakdown and explain complex technical issues to both technical and non-technical audiences
  * Mentor and coach junior teammates, helping them elevate their skills and careers

### To be successful, you should have:

  * A demonstrated level of staff software engineering experience on a full stack development team
  * Experience with the entire software development lifecycle in the Agile/Scrum framework
  * Experience or strong knowledge of Ruby on Rails and/or React/TypeScript, but more importantly an interest and willingness to work fullstack
  * A proven track record of building highly scalable software
  * Experience leading a team or a project and acting as a technical leader
  * Strong software design and architecture skills 
  * Enthusiasm for delivering value early and often to customers
  * An inquisitive mindset; ability to ask a lot of questions, seek out new information and remain open to new ideas and perspectives.
  * The ability to self serve, take initiative and find resources necessary to accomplish a project or solve a problem.

**It would be really great (but not a deal-breaker) if you had:**

  * Experience with cloud infrastructure and tooling
  * Experience with mobile app development, with preference to React-Native in a production environment

### What you can expect from Jobber:

Having been named as a Top 10 Great Place to Work in Canada, we walk the talk. Here are just some of the great things you can expect from us:

  * A total compensation package that includes an extended health benefits package with fully paid premiums for both body and mind, RRSP matching, and stock options.
  * A dedicated Coaching and Development function, including Development Coaches, to help build the career you want and hit the goals you set, while ensuring youâ€™re reaching your fullest potential.
  * Support for **all** your breaks: from vacation to rest and recharge, your birthday off to celebrate, health days to support your physical and mental health, and parental leave top-ups to support your growing family.
  * A unique opportunity to build, grow, and leave your impact on a $400-billion industry that has no dominant player...yet.
  * To work with a group of people who are humble, supportive, and give a sh*t about our customers.
