Description

### Company Description

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely â€“ and so has Block. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldnâ€™t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions â€“ to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, weâ€™ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, weâ€™re a partner to sellers of all sizes â€“ large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Block and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. Weâ€™re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

### Job Description

Squareâ€™s rapidly growing Square Banking has revolutionized the way businesses and consumers obtain the funding needed to achieve their goals. Unlike traditional business financing products, Square Banking extends offers to pre-qualified sellers with no application process, funds are deposited as soon as the next business day, and repayment happens as a fixed percentage of daily card sales. Since the product launched in 2014, Square Banking Credit has extended more than $9 billion to hundreds of thousands of sellers.
