If you want to take more ownership of your career, then you're ready to be part of Groupon.

We're a "best of both worlds" kind of company.

We're curious, fun, a little intense, and kind of obsessed with helping local businesses thrive. Does that sound like a compelling place to work?

  * Being a technical leader who will help drive the product and team culture which is focused on inclusivity, ownership, and collaboration
  * Collaborating with Product and Engineering management to understand requirements and design flexible solutions for our global systems
  * Implementing, testing, deploying, and providing production support in weekly iterations
  * Mentoring and helping grow the other engineers on the team

 **Weâ€™re excited about you if you have:**

  * 6+ years of developing and supporting software
  * Deep knowledge of a dynamic or functional programming language
  * Experience in Ruby and Java
  * Experience working with relational databases(MySQL and Postgres) and web technologies.
  * A desire to do pair programming
  * A dedication to writing well-tested code
  * The ability to communicate with non-engineering teams throughout the company as we frequently work with Product, Accounting, and Support teams.

 **We value engineers who are:**

  * Customer-focused: We believe that doing whatâ€™s right for the customer is ultimately what will drive our business forward.
  * Obsessed with quality: Your production code just works & scales linearly
  * Team players. You believe that more can be achieved together. You listen to feedback and also provide supportive feedback to help others grow/improve.
  * Fast learners: We are willing to disrupt our existing business to trial new products and solutions. You love learning how to use new technologies and then rapidly apply them to new problems.
  * Pragmatic: We do things quickly to learn what our customers desire. You know when itâ€™s appropriate to take shortcuts that donâ€™t sacrifice quality or maintainability.

Be cautious of individuals falsely representing Groupon's Talent Acquisition team with fake job offers. If you encounter any suspicious job offers or interview calls demanding money, recognize these as scams. Groupon is not responsible for losses from such dealings.
