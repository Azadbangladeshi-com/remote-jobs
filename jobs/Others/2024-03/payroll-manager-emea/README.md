### Company Description

Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.

Hello, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship office is in Sydney, Australia, but we've made our way from down under, to a hub San Francisco, which is now home to our US operations. We offer flexibility in how and where you work. **Please note: we are only able to hire this role in the state of California.**

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales, change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavor of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

This role is a fantastic opportunity to champion Canvaâ€™s employee-centric attitude across the EMEA region. The primary responsibility of the Payroll Manager will be to own the end-to-end payroll processes across EMEA, serving as the main point of contact and subject matter expert for all payroll-related matters within the region. This role will actively support global expansion initiatives in EMEA, while also playing a key role in shaping our processes for continued growth and the increasing complexities of payroll and benefits compliance in EMEA. The Payroll Manager will have the chance to make a significant impact, helping to shape the evolution of Canva's payroll function.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Ownership of end-to-end payroll processing for EMEA, ensuring accuracy, compliance, and timeliness.

  * Serve as the go-to resource and subject matter expert for all EMEA payroll-related matters, including future payroll or Employer of Record (EOR) expansions within the region.

  * Stay up-to-date with payroll laws, regulations, and tax requirements across EMEA, ensuring payroll processes are compliant.

  * Identify opportunities for process optimization and automation within the payroll function, implementing best practices to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

  * Collaborate with People Ops, Legal, Finance, and other departments to communicate and implement payroll-related changes, policies, and procedures.

  * Compile and analyze payroll data, producing regular reports for management and relevant stakeholders.

  * Drive continuous improvement initiatives to enhance payroll operations, data integrity, and reporting capabilities.

  * Collaborate with cross-functional teams to support system upgrades, implementations, and integrations related to payroll systems.

  * Provide leadership in addressing complex payroll issues and resolving escalations, ensuring excellent customer service.

  * Be part of a fun and agile team that constantly seeks to support and develop each other in a hyper-growth environment.

### You're probably a match if:

  * Bachelor's degree in Business, Finance, Accounting, or a related field. A Certified Payroll Professional (CPP) or Global Payroll Management Institute (GPMI) designation is a plus.

  * At least 5-7 years of payroll experience in EMEA, with specific expertise in handling complex payroll processes and ensuring compliance across multiple countries in EMEA.

  * In-depth knowledge of payroll regulations, tax laws, and labor legislation across various countries within the EMEA region.

  * Highly organized, and attention to detail, with the ability to ensure accuracy in payroll calculations and data entry.

  * Proficiency in using payroll software and systems. Experience with Papaya, ADP, Workday or similar platforms is preferred.

  * Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to effectively liaise with cross-functional teams, employees, and external partners.

  * Strong analytical and creative problem-solving skills, with the capacity to identify issues and implement solutions proactively.

  * Advanced proficiency in Excel/Google Sheets, with expertise in managing large datasets and creating complex formulas, functions, and macros.

  * Ability to thrive in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, adapting quickly to changing circumstances and effectively navigating competing priorities.

  * High level of integrity and discretion, handling confidential employee information and sensitive payroll data.
