**Headquarters:** Melbourne, Australia.  
**URL:** https://cliniko.com

**About the Job  
**  

We are looking for a few amazing software developers to join our globally remote team at Cliniko. This is no ordinary job‚Äîwe‚Äôll likely provide you with the best place to work you‚Äôve ever experienced! This is a full stack web development role with a focus on the server side. We‚Äôre keen to find smart developers who work well autonomously and are passionate about what they do. You should be experienced in software development, but there‚Äôs no requirement for how much or with any specific technologies. We‚Äôre mostly seeking senior or mid level developers, but we will consider any stand out applications.  
  

**What is Cliniko?  
**  

Cliniko is practice management software that makes life easy for allied health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, running video consultations, and much more. The software is used globally by 100,000+ people every day.  
  

It‚Äôs a web application built using Ruby on Rails in the back end and we‚Äôre in the process of transitioning the front end to React.  
  

**Our team  
**  

Behind Cliniko is a team of about 50 people, spread around the world. We work completely remotely, although our base is in Melbourne, Australia. We care more about finding the best person for the job than looking for someone that lives nearby.  
  

We don't have managers, we almost never have meetings, and there are no time sheets to complete. We're responsible, autonomous, creative, and proactive in doing our best for our customers. We're focused on making great software and we take pride in doing good work. It‚Äôs also important to us that we have a positive impact on the world.  
  

If you want to know more about how we work, our founder, Joel, gave a talk about it.

  
**What you‚Äôll work on  
**  

You will spend your time developing Cliniko. Some of the things you‚Äôll do are:

  * Adding new features.
  * Improving existing features.
  * Fixing bugs.
  * Refactoring code.
  * Maintaining the existing code.
  * Reviewing code written by other developers.
  * Making Cliniko faster.
  * Improving security.
  * Resolving issues for customers.
  * Assisting the support team with queries. 
  * Testing and deploying your own code.
  * Anything else you think needs doing.

Basically, you‚Äôll be doing all you can to make Cliniko better for our customers.  
  

**About you  
**  

You are someone who loves to code and values code that is easy to understand. You‚Äôre passionate about your work having a positive impact. You want to learn and share what you know.  
  

Taking initiative and being responsible come naturally to you. You want your code meticulously reviewed, so that you can improve it. You also enjoy doing the same in return. You like working with a team, but you are driven and motivated to take control of your projects and deliver your own code.  
  

You understand the importance of security practices in your development. You write tests because they matter, not just to achieve coverage.  
  

You‚Äôre comfortable working from the database through to the DOM. This includes:

  * Relational databases.
  * Queues and caches.
  * Server side web frameworks.
  * JSON APIs, our own and 3rd party services.
  * Client side JS.

You're proficient in all of these and extremely capable in at least a few. Experience with Ruby on Rails is not required, but similar experience and an ability to quickly come up to speed is. In this role you don't need to have extensive skills in HTML and CSS‚Äîwe have team members who excel at those who will help you out.  
  

No matter what your background is or how you identify, if you feel you meet the requirements, we encourage you to apply. We know that having a diverse team brings the benefit of different perspectives, and this is how we‚Äôll keep finding new ways to make Cliniko better. We are committed to the continual diversification of the team and working to constantly improve our inclusivity which is crucial to how we work.  
  

**How we work  
**  

Here are some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:

  * 30-hour work week, full-time pay.
  * Flexible hours, choose when you work.
  * Work from anywhere.
  * Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).
  * Supplied computer equipment.
  * Ergonomic furniture.
  * Fresh organic fruit delivered weekly to your home.
  * Overseas trips for full team meet-ups (family invited and paid for too).
  * No managers.
  * No meetings.

  
**How to apply  
**  

The following page has the application form with a few questions. The ‚ÄúTell us about yourself‚Äù field needs to give us enough information to be interested in taking you to the next stage. We typically get a lot of applications (hundreds at a minimum), so do put some effort into this section please. Notably, there's no resume or cover letter submission, so this is your spot to give us some insight into who you are. And please be yourself, there‚Äôs no need for formality.  
  

There'll be a few other short questions, including one asking for an answer to a pseudocode statement, and one about our security features. It's important to answer those two correctly. We won‚Äôt consider any applications that get either wrong.  
  

**Note** : While the form does allow you to upload a resume, it‚Äôs only to pre-fill the contact fields for you. We won‚Äôt actually see the resume.  
  

Job applications **close 29th of March, 2024.  
**  

**What you can expect after applying  
**  

Once you‚Äôve applied, sit back and relax while we get to work on our side! We‚Äôll be reviewing all the applications as they come in and we‚Äôll get back to you a week after applications close at the latest. Everyone will hear back from us, successful or not.  
  

If we select you for the next stage, it will be a short 5 minute chat with our founder, Joel. Following the chat, if you‚Äôre still a contender, there‚Äôll be a technical task to complete. These tasks are paid.  
  

Lastly, you‚Äôd meet with some people from our team and then we‚Äôll make the final decision. This is the exciting part for us and hopefully also for the chosen person: we‚Äôll hire them to join our team! This will happen fast, and the start date will be chosen by the applicant.  
  

We know it‚Äôs quite a process to go through, so we want to make sure you know what you‚Äôre in for up front. We‚Äôll be transparent with everyone along the way.  
  

One final note, unfortunately due to the quantity of applications we receive, we are not able to provide feedback for those not successful in the first round. In the later stages, we‚Äôll do our best to provide what we can, if requested.  
  

Good luck!
