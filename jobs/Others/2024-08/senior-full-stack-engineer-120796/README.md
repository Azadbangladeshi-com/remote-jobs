 **About Us**

Circle is building the world‚Äôs leading all-in-one platform for online communities. We make it possible for creators, coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events, chat, courses, and payments ‚Äî all in one place, all under their own brand.

  

We‚Äôre proud to be a fully remote company of around 150 (and growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world. We strive to find exceptional talent, empower them to do their best work, and in turn, have a meaningful impact in their own lives. We don‚Äôt track hours, but we manage for outcomes in an a-synchronous culture.

  

Twice a year, we bring the whole company together for incredible company retreats in beautiful places around the world!

  

 **About the role**

We're looking for a Senior Full-stack Engineer to join the special projects team as we aim to make Circle the top choice for creator/brand-led communities. You‚Äôll be working on internal tools used by everyone at Circle, cutting-edge AI features, and new customer-facing features used by millions.

  

In this role, you will collaborate with our leaders, designers, other engineers, and participate in all stages of the development lifecycle --from initial task definition to final deployment. As a senior engineer, you'll break down large epics into actionable tasks, follow through with development and testing, review PRs, push updates to production, and gradually release behind feature flags. Your responsibilities will also include bug-fixing and continuous improvement of the codebase. This role requires a high level of technical proficiency and a strong understanding of software development best practices.

### What you‚Äôll be doing

* Work autonomously on a product built in **Ruby on Rails backend** and **React front-end.**
* Build critical features and improvements for our web app, with a product-first mindset.
* Work closely with Circle's leaders throughout the feature design process.
* Work closely with our designers to create a world-class user experience.
* Improve the quality of our codebase and identify architectural deficiencies
* Learn, implement, and maintain new integrations with services like OpenAI, Zendesk, Hubspot, Notion, and Slack to improve the daily operations of our customer-facing teams.
* Foster a bias for action, prioritizing speed of iteration without compromising on the quality of code or user experience.

  

### What you‚Äôll need to be successful

* Strong alignment with our values. Find our values on our career page if you haven‚Äôt read up on them yet.
* You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading) at a CEFR Level C1 / ILR Level 5.

* Strong proficiency in **Ruby on Rails, MySQL/Postgresql, ReactJS, TypeScript, CSS/SCCS, TailwindCSS.**
* Familiarity with both frontend and backend is necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not a requirement. Or, put another way: you should be able to individually build most small to medium features end-to-end across the stack, but you can be much better at backend than at front-end.
* A desire to work in an environment which values speed of iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing personal accountability and the ability to collaborate effectively as part of a dynamic team.
* Great communication skills both in writing and verbal/oral (English).
* Should be able to lead a complex project end to end with judgment and an attention to detail when it comes to architectural, product, design, and process decisions, your judgment should inspire a high level of trust within the team.
* Experience working on a fully distributed remote team.
* Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new technologies when projects require it.

  

### Bonus points

* Previous experience working with community and / or creator platforms.
* Experience with creating robust integrations with external services.
* Experience with OpenAI, large language models, or other AI tools.
* Experience at a fast-growing start-up.
* A track record of picking up new technologies and skills as you ship high-quality code.
