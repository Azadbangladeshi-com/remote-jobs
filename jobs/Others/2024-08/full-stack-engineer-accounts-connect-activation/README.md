## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

We oversee Accounts and Connect APIs and dashboard surfaces that Stripe users rely on to run their business.

As part of revamping our Accounts Platform for the next decade plus, we have the opportunity to solve challenging user pain points at scale and build a granular, expressive framework powering usersâ€™ onboarding experience as well as that of their own end users. As part of revamping our Platform Abstractions, we have an opportunity to provide flexibility to our users in terms of their economic model, funds flows, and how they integrate their business with Stripe.

A strong foundation of customizable account structures and interoperable APIs is critical to Stripeâ€™s long-term success. Itâ€™s important we get the set of core business blocks right â€“ that we understand how businesses of all sizes model their organizational structures and think about their relationships, and we ensure that integrating with Stripe is nothing short of a fantastic experience. We are applying Stripeâ€™s developer-centric approach to building a flexible, programmable representation of humans, businesses, and money that maps across all Stripe products.

### **What you'll do**

Engineers on the team will design and build end-to-end features for Stripeâ€™s Accounts and Connect APIs. This includes features for Stripeâ€™s largest users with complex integrations, as well as new users, solopreneurs, and startups. We are seeking engineers who are excited to develop features for these foundations as well as their API and UI representations, delivering best-in-class product experiences for our users.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Build beautiful end-to-end user experiences as well as high-performance APIs that power them 
  * Ensure our infrastructure is extensible, scalable, and reliable for both internal and external users
  * Collaborate with cross-functional partner teams to deliver delightful developer experiences and comprehensive interfaces with core account and money movement primitives
  * Reduce complexity for our users via simple yet powerful abstractions

## **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * Strong technical background, including 4+ years of experience as a full stack engineer, with an affinity for building scalable backend infrastructure.
  * Experience delivering, extending, and maintaining large scale distributed systems.
  * Empathetic, collaborative, and user-first mindset in everything you build
  * Interest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users
  * Ability to stitch together many different services together even if you have not worked with them before

  * The skills to build holistically â€“ from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impact
  * Ability to work well cross-functionally and earn trust from colleagues at all levels
  * Experience mentoring and growing junior engineers as their technical leader

### **Preferred qualifications**

  * Junior and fellow senior engineers feel they are able to learn from you, and you care deeply about mentoring others

  * You are often cited as the inspiration for engineers that join your team
