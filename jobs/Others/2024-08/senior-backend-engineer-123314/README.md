### 1047 Games  
#### `ðŸ’° ` `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

### **Overview**

1047 Games began with the simple principle that people should have fun while making great games. Bucking convention and driven by a passion to create the ultimate gaming experience, Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian founded 1047 Games in 2017 in their Stanford dorm room. Their love for arena shooters of the past drove them to create Splitgate, a unique sci-fi first-person shooter that adds portal guns to upend the genre.

What started as two computer science majors putting portals into a first-person shooter for a project demo has evolved into a VC-backed company which has raised more than $120MM in funding.

At 1047 Games, youâ€™ll find a permanently remote, dedicated team of top-tier talent from some of the worldâ€™s biggest gaming and tech companies who share our foundersâ€™ vision. Grit, ingenuity, a desire to have fun, and a start up mentality define our crew. We are currently working on a brand new shooter in the Splitgate universe.
