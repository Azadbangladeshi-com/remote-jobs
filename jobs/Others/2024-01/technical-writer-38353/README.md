**Why work at Blue Coding?**

  

At Blue Coding we specialize in hiring excellent developers and amazing people from all over Latin America and other parts of the world. For the past 9 years, weÃ¢Â€Â™ve helped cutting-edge companies in the United States and Canada -both large and small, build great development teams and develop great products. Online shops, digital agencies, SaaS providers, and software consulting firms are a few of our clients. Our team of over 100 engineers is distributed in more than 10 countries across the Americas. We are a fully remote company working with a wide array of technologies and have expertise in every stage of the software development process.

We also participate in group activities like movie nights, trivia, and meme competitions. We stand for honesty, fairness, respect, efficiency, hard work, and cooperation.

  

 **What's unique about this job?**

  

As a Technical Writer, youÃ¢Â€Â™ll be part of a massive migration, rebuilding, and rewriting of our client's existing application working alongside a top-of-the-line team creating this application from the ground up to transition it to modern languages and practices. This transition will be divided into 5 phases and post-launch support and iteration. This is a very long-term project.

  

The platform supports all business functions from sourcing and pricing, purchasing, implementation and project management, customer lifecycle management, incident management, financial management, expense management, and business process automation and integrations. This is written in Coldfusion running on Lucee with ColdBox. About half of the source code has been refactored into an MVC framework while other pages may still be in a single file approach. There is some code that is still tag-based but much of this has been migrated to a script-based code structure.

  

As the platform is rebuilt, the client will be implementing a new UI based on their design standards which are based on Bootstrap 5. Additionally, they will deprecate certain functionality or data points from the application to streamline the User Experience and better align with how the company operates various parts of the business.

Here are some of the exciting day-to-day challenges you will face in this role:
