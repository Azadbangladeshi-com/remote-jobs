**Headquarters:** Frankfurt, Germany  
**URL:** https://withyou.dev

We're looking for a talented and ambitious Software Engineering Lead to join our founding team as a key contributor. You will be responsible for architecting and delivering software experiences for startup clients and our in-house product development initiatives.  
  
We are stack agnostic, but focus primarily on B2C and B2B web applications, so proficiency in modern web frameworks is preferred. We are open to different levels of experience; what's non-negotiable is that you are excited to create value through world class product experiences.  
  
 **What Awaits You**

  * Get your hands dirty and ship product from Day 1
  * Lead the architecture of solutions for clients and internal projects
  * Exposure to a broad range of technologies and business contexts
  * A direct path to leadership and management within the company as it grows

You will be the first full-time engineer on our team, so this role is uniquely positioned for someone that is excited by the adventure of building something impactful, together. We're building not just game-changing products, but also a company culture that creates lasting value for all stakeholders.

  

 **Your Profile**

  * At least 5 years fullstack web app development experience
  * Very strong English communication skills
  * An eye for solid engineering and software architecture
  * An attention to detail and pride in what you ship
  * Hungry to learn and expand your skillset
  * Ability to travel within/to Europe for regular team coworking

Bonus points for a degree in Computer Science, devops and cloud infrastructure experience, and an entrepreneurial mindset.  
  
 **Compensation  
**  
We are offering US $72,000 p.a. in addition to budget for regular travel and the tools you need to grow professionally. For the right match, this role can quickly evolve into a leadership position with further financial upside.  
  
 **The Logistics  
  
** We are based primarily in Europe, with clients in North American timezones. Therefore, the ideal candidate will not be further ahead than UTC + 4.  
  
The role will also require a little (fun!) travel within Europe, so visa-free travel permission is important and which is why we strongly prefer Europe-based candidates.  
  
 **About Us  
**  
We're a two man founding-team spread between Germany and the UK, with a common vision of changing the way software products are built.  
  
Our founding members have created startups, apps for unicorns, and digital product experiences for some of the world's biggest companies. We're now helping ambitious startups realise their product goals by embedding ourselves as an extension of their product & technology teams.  
  
The team gets together once a month across Europe, to foster good team vibes and to bridge the gap between remote work flexibility and the power of colocated collaboration.  
  
 **Our Product**  
  
In parallel to client engagements, we're building our own product that helps founders and business leaders manage their technology risk: withyou.technology
