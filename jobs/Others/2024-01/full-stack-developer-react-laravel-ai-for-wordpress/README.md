**Description:**

WPAI is seeking a talented full-stack developer, skilled in Laravel and React, to join our fully remote team in a full-time capacity. We are building an all-in-one platform for WordPress creators, alongside an in-site agent, and are scaling our team to move faster and deliver a better product.

You will work with our team to help improve our platform, further our AI capabilities, and build the future of WordPress. Responsibilities include frontend React development (e.g. building components, maintaining in Storybook, and implementing in production) and backend Laravel development (e.g. implementing new functionalities like direct API connections to WordPress websites).

We value demonstrable experience across diverse project types over years of experience (portfolio of previous work required).
