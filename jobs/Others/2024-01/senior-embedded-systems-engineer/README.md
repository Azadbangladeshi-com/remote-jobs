## **Who is Flock?**

Flock Safety provides the first public safety operating system that empowers private communities and law enforcement to work together to eliminate crime. We are committed to protecting human privacy and mitigating bias in policing with the development of best-in-class technology rooted in ethical design, which unites civilians and public servants in pursuit of a safer, more equitable society.

Our Safety-as-a-Service approach includes affordable devices powered by LTE and solar that can be installed anywhere. Our technology detects and captures objective details, decodes evidence in real-time and delivers investigative leads into the hands of those who matter.

While safety is a serious business, we are a supportive team that is optimizing the remote experience to create strong and fun relationships even when we are physically apart. Our flock of hard-working employees thrive in a positive and inclusive environment, where a bias towards action is rewarded. Flock Safety is headquartered in Atlanta and operates nationwide. We have raised over $380M in venture capital including a recent Series E round led by Tiger Global. Now surpassing a 3B valuation, Flock is scaling intentionally and seeking the best and brightest to help us meet our goal of reducing crime in the United States by 25% in the next three years.

  * Work with stakeholders in Hardware, Software, Cloud Platform, Operations, and Program Management to define system requirements, testing procedures, integration and generally owning and addressing cross functional topics

 **We're looking for people with:**

  * Have a Masters or Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, or related field with 5+ years experience
  * Have hands-on embedded electronics prototyping experience
  * Are comfortable interacting with code in multiple languages to create, validate, and profile embedded devices
  * Are comfortable working cross-functionally across multiple projects
  * Are able to squeeze power and performance out of a potato
  * Possess effective verbal and written communication skills
  * Have humility, curiosity, and a passion for sharing knowledge.
  * Have experience commercializing electronic hardware in the consumer or industrial IoT space
  * Have a healthy skepticism of and trust-but-verify relationship with abstraction layers

 **The ideal candidate will be comfortable:**

  * Acting as the glue between embedded hardware, software, and program management
  * With bare metal and RTOS code on MCUs
  * Translating product goals into technical requirements
  * Prototyping and triaging issues on embedded Android and MCU systems
  * Reading schematics and PCB layout
  * Interacting with a variety of programming and scripting languages (C, Python, SQL, Kotlin, Matlab, Java, Bash)
