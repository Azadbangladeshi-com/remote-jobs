###  **Job Description**

Arista Networks is looking for world-class Software Test Engineers to help us in building the highest quality networking products you can buy.

Instead, youâ€™ll bring your intelligence, creativity, and drive to work every day to help us understand how our products are going to be used by our customers and to make sure that theyâ€™re going to work every time. Your job is to find the hard bugs, the ones not easily exposed by the developersâ€™ automated unit and product level tests.

  * Write test plans to validate Arista features and products.
  * Design test network topologies to validate functionality, performance, stability and scalability of features and products.
  * Execute test plans to verify all aspects of the product. Identify defects and validate resolution.
  * Work as an agile member of a combined development and test team, running in short cycles to develop functional software in quick iterations.
  * Work with the developers on your team in creating their plans for automated tests to complement the exploratory testing that you perform. Be the testing expert for your team.
  * Participate in functional specification and software design reviews held by your team and provide customer centric input.

###  **Qualifications**

  * Proven expertise in creating test methodologies and writing test plans.
  * Strong knowledge in one or more of the following areas: Ethernet, RSTP/ MSTP, VLANs, IP Routing, TCP/IP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, IGMP, PIM SM/ SSM, QoS, L2-L3 protocols, Platform validation, HA, QOS, network management.
  * Experience with IXIA and/or Spirent test tools desired
  * Familiarity with test automation tools and scripting languages desired
  * BS CS/CE/EE plus 3+ years of experience. MS degree preferred
  * Strong communication skills.
  * CCIE certification a plus.
