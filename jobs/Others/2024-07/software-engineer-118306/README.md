We believe the best products are built by teams rich in diversity and aligned in mission and values. That means creating an authentic culture where people thrive and grow. It means building a team where different perspectives are valued through real listening, and assumptions are challenged through healthy and necessary conflict. It means building a team diverse across race and gender. It means constantly striving to build the best and to be the best.

Our engineering team dedicates itself to continuous learning and improvement. We optimize for rapid, agile development with engineers deploying to production many times a day. To find and build the best solutions, we expect our teams to iterate. From the introduction of minimum viable products to the release of more mature features, Engineers must actively seek feedback from customers and internal stakeholders, gather data, and continually improve both the product and development process.

The role of Software Engineer is to build and maintain the software powering NationBuilder. You contribute to the effectiveness of the team through constant collaboration, efficient use of available resources, and writing software that is easy to reason about and modify in the future. You think critically to find the best solutions, technologies, and processes. You are capable of implementing significant portions of code and investigating issues in a complex codebase, while following standards of quality for software, testing, and documentation.

With the NationBuilder engineering team, you will take part in innovating meaningful solutions that impact our customers‚Äô user experience ranging from building highly interactive and rich user interfaces to ensuring our authentication system stays on the edge of security and web best practices. Looking ahead, some of the potential things you‚Äôll be at the forefront of:

  * Looking at innovative ways to ensure the best performance of our page loads and rendering

**You:**

  * Have a growth mindset and are eager to learn.
  * Get excited about pairing and the opportunity to give and receive peer feedback.
  * Enjoy being responsive to customer feedback.
  * Are a pragmatic problem solver, knowing how to find the middle ground between ‚Äúperfect, but takes forever to code‚Äù and ‚Äúfixes it now, but nobody will ever be able to understand what I did.‚Äù
  * Are developing your skills to communicate about technical solutions with both engineering and non-engineering stakeholders.
  * Work well in small teams with a clear mission.
  * Have the insight to know what‚Äôs important and the dedication to get it done.

**Skills required:**

We value the willingness to learn our technologies and our environment. An open and disciplined approach to your work is as important to us as years of experience with any of the technologies in our stack.
