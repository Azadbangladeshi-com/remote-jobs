We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.

 **About the Engineering Team**

Join Our Engineering Team and Shape the Future of Healthcare Technology! Our dedicated team is revolutionizing mental healthcare with comprehensive Provider and Patient Portals, empowering providers and patients alike. As we transition to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), you'll play a key role in reshaping our systems, ensuring agility and scalability. In our event-driven architecture, we're navigating challenges to protect sensitive data. With the introduction of GraphQL, a Centralized Component Library, and an Authorization Service, you'll be part of our innovative strides. Join us in shaping healthcare's future and making a difference!

 **About the Role**

We're looking for a Software Engineer to empower Rula's Growth team to develop primarily customer-facing projects that boost patient and provider enrollment. In this role, you'll engage in the development of high-impact solutions within a cross-functional team.

Your mission is to craft full-stack solutions in four main areas: optimizing patient enrollment by building tools to enhance site experiences and explore new marketing channels, improving foundational analytics by developing internal tools for marketing automation and brand support, scaling provider solutions to meet growing patient demand, and enhancing mental healthcare access through strategic partnership enablement.

Throughout, youâ€™ll apply your expertise and experience to pair with fellow engineers, improve our processes, and foster a culture of engineering excellence. The ideal candidate will present a bias for action along with excellent collaboration, problem-solving skills, and a strong sense of ownership.

 **Technical Stack**

Rula's systems are written in Typescript/Node.js or Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases, and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team, but weâ€™re now ready to bring much of this work in-house. Weâ€™re standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesnâ€™t matter if you donâ€™t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack; weâ€™d still love to connect with you!

  * 2+ years of software engineering experience

  * Experience working on cross-functional teams

  * Experience working on time-sensitive projects, balancing multiple stakeholderâ€™s needs

  * Experience developing SaaS applications using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform

  * Experience developing with distributed systems development, using an event-based paradigm, queuing or publish-subscribe such as Apache Kafka

  * Experience with Ruby, React, Javascript, SQL, and/or Python

  * Experience developing applications using Postgresql or equivalent

 **We're serious about your well-being! As Part Of Our Team, Full-Time Employees Receive**

  * 100% remote work environment from anywhere in the US

  * Competitive pay and benefits that donâ€™t change based on location

  * Health benefits: medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and FSA/HSA
