At Cisco Meraki, we know that technology can connect, empower, and drive us. Our mission is to simplify technology so our customers can focus on what's most meaningful to them: their students, patients, customers, and businesses. Weâ€™re making IT and security easier, faster, and smarter with technology that simply works. Our customers use the Meraki web dashboard, mobile app, and programmable APIs to monitor, configure, and automate critical IT infrastructure that serves tens of millions of people every single day.

Meraki Vision (MV) is the team responsible for building our security cameras with a unique edge-storage architecture. The Meraki MV system is powerful, secure, and does not rely on any on-premise servers, making it easy to deploy and scale from one to hundreds of cameras per site. Today, cameras are mainly used for security, but what if they could be used for more? Imagery from a camera is information that can solve a problem or offer an alternative insight. MV cameras blend the best of cloud and IoT technology, making it simpler and easier for customers to use the camera as a sensor!

MV Platform Engineers take the lead in building new Meraki security cameras and are responsible our low level device firmware which is built on Linux and open-source software. Our fast paced team members work individually and in small project teams to release several new products each year.

As part of Meraki software engineers, we breathe life into our cloud-managed networking devices, which range from switches, routers, and wireless access points and security cameras. We use real-time telemetry from thousands of deployed networks spanning the globe to continuously improve the performance and stability of our products.

## **As a Senior Software Engineer focused on MV platform, you will:**

  * Own projects from software project scoping and timelines, block-diagram concepts, to prototype boards that donâ€™t boot, all the way to shipping product.
  * Collaborate with our Hardware Engineering team on component selection and high-level architecture for new Meraki products.
  * Collaborate with our manufacturing partners to develop secure, reliable, and scalable manufacturing processes.
  * Integrate vendor board support packages and software development kits with our firmware and build system.
  * Develop, port, and debug Linux device drivers.
  * When things donâ€™t go quite as plannedâ€”a board doesnâ€™t boot, an LED doesnâ€™t light, a fan doesnâ€™t spinâ€”use a JTAG debugger or logic analyzer or work with the hardware team to debug the problem.
  * Collaborate with other Platform Bring-up Engineers across product teams to continually improve our firmware design, development, and deployment practices.

## **You are an ideal candidate if you:**

  * Have 10+ years professional experience programming in C or C++.
  * Have expert knowledge of embedded systems development concepts, including cross-platform development and build tools (GNU toolchain, OpenWRT, buildroot, Yocto), bootloaders (U-Boot, coreboot, UEFI), kernel configuration, device drivers, device trees.
  * Have strong experience in scoping and planning embedded system firmware tasks from engineering concept to product delivery
  * Have strong systems and networking foundational knowledge (systems architecture, memory hierarchy, storage subsystems, LANs, routing).
  * Know common bus protocols like I2C, SPI, and MDIO.
  * Have experience reading schematics and data sheets.

## **Bonus points for:**

  * Upstreaming Linux patches.
  * Experience with multi-threaded or parallel programming.
  * Are comfortable using network protocol analyzers, logic analyzers, hardware debuggers, and source-level debuggers to troubleshoot problems at all layers of the stack.
  * Experience writing device drivers.
  * Experience with image sensors, GPUs, ISPs, DSPs, h.264 and other video encoding technologies.
