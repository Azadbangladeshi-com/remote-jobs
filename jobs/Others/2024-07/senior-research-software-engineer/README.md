#### `ðŸ’° USD $138,400~$173,000` `ðŸŒŽ Remote - US`  

At Invitae, our mission is to empower doctors and patients to use genetic and genomic information to make informed medical decisions at all life stages. The Clinical Science and Interpretation (CSI) team plays a critical role in expanding and improving medical interpretation capabilities by designing and developing robust, quantitative, and scalable systems. We achieve this by combining Invitaeâ€™s unmatched clinical genomic expertise with the latest AI/ML technologies.

We have an opening on our CSI team for a Senior Research Software Engineer. The primary responsibility of this role will be to contribute to the design and development of our platform, which supports the rapid prototyping, scalable deployment, and evaluation of diverse evidence models. These models in turn provide key support for clinical interpretation of genetic testing results, directly impacting hundreds of thousands of patients every year. The CSI team is highly cross-functional and multi-disciplinary. You will work along-side genomic scientists, biophysicists, cellular engineers, data scientists, computational biologists, and medical geneticists to bring improved healthcare to patients.

Our team is committed to advancing the science and technology of genetic testing. This commitment requires us to integrate and foster the knowledge and growth of diverse domain expertise in biological, computational, and clinical sciences. You will champion a productive software development culture across the entire team. Your ability to communicate effectively with non-engineers regarding quantitative analyses, quality control, machine learning, computational simulations, clinical genomics, and other diverse types of biological data is paramount to the teamâ€™s success.

**_What youâ€™ll do:_**

  * Modernize and expand upon our end-to-end platform that enables scientists of various backgrounds to rapidly prototype, scale, validate and distribute diverse methods to support variant interpretation in genetic testing. 
  * Help lead and support the teamâ€™s software engineering culture. Write structured, tested, readable and maintainable code. Participate in code reviews to ensure code quality and distribute knowledge. Support your teammates by encouraging learning and growth in their engineering capacities.
  * Enhance and improve our computational infrastructure for machine learning; support workflows and libraries to rapidly integrate advances in diverse fields of biological, computer, and clinical sciences.
  * Keep our evidence models up-to-date. Retrain models with new data. Support the deployment and integration of evidence models for the clinical variant interpretation team.
  * Work and communicate effectively in a lean, highly collaborative and cross-disciplinary team to deliver quantitative, mechanistic, and scalable support for clinical interpretation of genetic results.
  * Effectively interface with other engineering teams at Invitae to achieve cross-functional goals.

**_What you bring:_ **

  * A minimum of 8 years of related experience with a Bachelorâ€™s degree; or 6 years and a Masterâ€™s degree; or a PhD with 3 years experience.

  * Industry experience with full-stack architecture and distributed systems, with fluency in Python. 
  * Strong ML Ops expertise and a passion for staying abreast of state-of-the-art ML Ops and data engineering technologies.
  * Hands-on experience with databases and building REST APIs.
  * Experience with genetics, molecular biology or bioinformatics is a plus.
  * Demonstrated commitment to proposing solutions that balance trusted and established approaches with innovative tools.
  * Demonstration of leadership experience or capabilities.
  * Thrives in a self-driven development environment.
  * Top-notch communication skills. Ability to work effectively in a highly cross-functional environment where collaboration across disciplines is a key component for team success.
  * A mission-oriented mindset and a desire to never stop learning.
