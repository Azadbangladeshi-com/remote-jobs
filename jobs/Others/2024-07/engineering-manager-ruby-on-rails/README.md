**Your role:**

As an Engineering Manager, you are an accomplished engineer, having led successful projects as a Senior Engineer or Engineering Lead before directly managing teams of four or more engineers. You are fully comfortable with agile management practices, and proven project managers who have delivered many large projects successfully. As a technical leader, you are constantly tracking the teamâ€™s efficiency and quality of deliverables at SDLC and regularly adjusting processes and timelines to ensure high quality is delivered. You take responsibility for producing software that is highly available, monitorable, and maintainable over time.

While in this role, you will spend less time writing code, but there is an expectation that you still engage in some technical deliverables such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of your team. More than writing code, you hold responsibility for identifying bottlenecks in the process and roadblocks to success for your team and clearing these roadblocks.

In this role your success will be determined by the success of your team. In particular, as a leader you are capable of identifying the most high-value projects and keeping your team focused on these projects. As part of keeping the team focused you will partner closely with Product to manage project scope and ensure the technical deliverables are met. In addition to focusing the team, you are capable of identifying headcount needs for the team and planning and recruiting to fill these needs.

As an Engineering Manager you operate as and are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from your own. You communicate expectations clearly to all team members, solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently (not just in the scope of review periods). In addition to strong management skills, as the engineering lead you acts as a leader for the technical roadmap for the pillar. You are able to clearly communicate the timeline, scope and risks to your pillar partners, and lead the delivery of major initiatives on clear timelines. Additionally, you identify areas of strategic technical debt, do the cost/benefit analysis for resolving this debt and communicate suggested timelines for prioritizing this to the management team.
