### **Develop a state-of-the-art product. Make sense of the future. Use data to drive business.**

At CB Insights we build products that help clients make sense of the future and drive their businesses forward using data. Our system retrieves large amounts of data in real time on the private market, and then extracts knowledge and insights from that data. We present those analytics through a dynamic user interface which enables our clients to make strategic business decisions around corporate strategy, innovation, investments, etc... Weâ€™re hiring for an AI engineer to help accelerate our product roadmap, leveraging the latest scalable intelligence tech to rapidly deliver high-value insights to our clients.

**The Role Youâ€™ll Play**

**About the team:**

This is a high performing, foot on the gas team filled with senior and lead engineers that use the latest, most capable AI tech to continually push the envelope. We work fast, we ship often, and weâ€™re typically same-day adopters of new frontier models.

We strongly value innovation, speed, work flexibility, independent problem solving, and the ability to rely on one another to get our respective work done. No egos, lots of respect, and trust.

Leveraging AI introduces many additional tradeoffs to balance, so in order to be successful youâ€™ll need to have a strong intuitive sense of product value, time to goal, diminishing returns, and which tool is best for a given task.

  * Develop AI-powered features and improve AI workflows and performance on a small Agile team.
  * Mentor other engineers in AI best practices, particularly in prompt engineering and LLM integration.
  * Consistently and frequently deliver solutions that leverage AI effectively, are well-engineered, maintainable and tested within the agreed-upon time frame.
  * Participate in code reviews and sprint planning, help identify opportunities for AI integration, work through challenges and share knowledge with colleagues.
  * Collaborate with the product team to understand business requirements and translate them into AI-powered solutions.

**What You Bring to the Table:**

  * 3+ years professional experience in backend engineering in Go, Python, or similar
  * Strong experience with prompt engineering and integrating LLMs into production systems
  * Deep understanding of the capabilities and limitations of various AI models and approaches
  * Experience with AI frameworks and tools, particularly those supporting advanced workflows and agent orchestration
  * Familiarity with containerization, cloud deployment, and multi-service architectures
  * Strong problem-solving skills and ability to optimize AI performance, cost, and quality
  * BS in Computer Science or similar work experience

**Youâ€™ll be successful here if:**

  * Youâ€™re passionate about using AI as a powerful lever to drive value for users
  * You can take a complex problem or goal, break it down, and devise and implement your own strategies for solving it
  * Working alongside other high-performing engineers motivates you

  * You have excellent written and verbal communication skills
