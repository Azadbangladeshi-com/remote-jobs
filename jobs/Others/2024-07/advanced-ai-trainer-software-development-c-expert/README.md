 **About Us**.  
Join the team thatâ€™s supporting the latest cutting-edge AI language models at Invisible Technologies. We are dedicated to using AI to transform industries and improve lives through innovative solutions. Our team consists of passionate individuals who are committed to pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities.  
 **The Business Context**  
AI is already a significant part of everyday life, from deciding what products to order to unlocking your screen with facial recognition. However, AI's potential extends far beyond these applications. It can assist in finding medical diagnoses, teaching scientific research, and solving complex functions. The effectiveness of AI depends on the quality of its training data and algorithms, and that's where we come in. We help model these behaviors to ensure AI performs at its best.  
But, like humans, algorithms are what they eat. Theyâ€™re only as good as the rules they know and the data theyâ€™re trained on. Weâ€™re the team that helps model these behaviors.  
 **Day in and day out, you will:**  
Spend the bulk of your time interacting with the AI, helping it analyze vast subject areas, and distinguishing between facts, context, and behavioral patterns.  
Continuously evaluate the AI based on accuracy of facts, interpretation, and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they interpret them.  
Actively attempt to "break" the AI by inducing mistakes and enhancing its recovery mechanisms, which is critical for its safety, accuracy, and usability. Youâ€™ll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client.  
 **The Person**  
This role accommodates individuals from diverse educational and professional backgrounds, valuing a mix of subject matter expertise, higher studies, research experience, and teaching/tutoring experience. The role relies more on your competencies than your formal experience â€“â€“ It is ideal for those seeking to apply their knowledge in the AI space, career transitioners, and those looking for an exciting encore career.  
You should be exceptional at listening and reading for ground-level facts and intended meaning, with the ability to explain the inferences made to link the two. Metacognitive awareness to "show your work" is crucial.  
As this role focuses on expertise with C++, hands-on development experience with C++ is essential.  
 **Compensation**  
This entry-level role is perfect for voracious readers early in their careers, or for career switchers keen to enter the technology field. Pay begins between $20-$25 / hour to top applicants worldwide.  
**Life & Career**  
Ideally you are available between EST or PST time zones. The work is steady, the hours are flexible, the work is enjoyable, and leaves room for advancement into more senior training roles and project management roles on the Invisible team as the project expands. Weâ€™re keen to share more in interviews.
