# [Full Stack Web Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/full-stack-web-engineer-114245)  
### NALA  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

### **Description**

### ðŸ’™ Our Mission

We have recently updated our Company Mission to reflect our ambitions to build the future of payments in Africa. You can read all about it here.

###  **Why does our mission matter?**

There are over 1.3 billion Africans in the world and is the fastest-growing region in the world. Africa is also the most expensive place to send money to and trade with. Talent is everywhere but opportunity isnâ€™t. How do we bridge this divide with a sense of purpose?

  * Think about people living far away from their loved ones who are financially responsible and support them. Imagine how you would feel losing 8-9% of your money through fees. **How do we reduce the cost of sending money home through technology?**
  * **What about the future for businesses?** Think about those who are trying to do cross-border business from Africa outbound to the rest of the world? Why is it so hard to trade today? Why do people have to send money with other people physically or cash on planes? How much money and time is lost while doing this?
  * **What about the reliability of trade?** When payments are delayed, that means business is disrupted. This costs everyone money. It loses us trust of customers.
  * **What about the future of work?** Think about those young TikTok influencers in Uganda who make amazing content, but canâ€™t get paid because they donâ€™t have Visa or Mastercards yet have mobile money?

**NALAâ€™s true impact will be measured by the opportunities we create for Africa to trade with the world and the world to trade with Africa.**

### ðŸ™Œ Your Mission

At Rafiki, we are on a mission to revolutionize the African fintech market with exceptional engineering and a strong commitment to our customers.

As part of this mission, you will help us build slick and solid web UI to better support our customers and enable our talented internal team to seamlessly orchestrate and manage our payments engine.

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Responsibilities in this Role

We are looking for an experienced Web UI engineer who specializes in web front-end technologies but also has a good enough understanding of backend as well. The ideal candidate will have a passion for web front-end development, a good eye for UX/design, and has had past experience working on backends. You should be able to manage and operate independently on layers such as backend-for-frontends with minimal support from our dedicated backend engineering team (you wonâ€™t be expected to operate deeper down, but it's a plus if you can).

Responsibilities:

  * Enhance our dedicated customers portal by adding slick UI features for self-onboarding, self-management, and sophisticated metrics and dashboards.
  * Improve our back-office tools to simplify the jobs of our internal teams, including treasury, finance, and customer support.
  * Help define strong front-end standards and good practices, contributing to our front-end culture and chapters.

### ðŸ”¥ Must Have Requirements

  * **Proficiency in React and Typescript:** Extensive experience in developing web applications using React and TypeScript, and in consuming web APIs such as RESTful, GraphQL, and gRPC.
  * **UI/UX Design:** Strong eye for UX/design to enhance user interfaces effectively.
  * **Grasp of backend technologies** : We use Golang, but itâ€™s not a requirement. Even if you have worked with other backend languages, that's okay as long as you have a theoretical understanding of backends.
  * **UI Testing:** Experience with writing and maintaining unit tests for UI components to ensure robustness and reliability.
  * **Agile Methodologies:** Experience working in Agile environments, contributing to sprint planning, and iterative development.

### ðŸ’ª Nice to Have Requirements

  * **Strong backend experience** : You have the ability to operate deeper within backend systems, working with database technologies, and contributing to core backend components when necessary. An extra plus if you know how to code with Golang ðŸ™Œ
  * **gRPC and Protobuf** : Experience with interacting, integrating, or developing APIs using gRPC and Protobuf
  * **CI/CD:** Knowledge of continuous integration and continuous deployment practices and tools.
  * **Startup Culture Experience:** Demonstrated experience working in a startup environment with a pragmatic approach to problem-solving and decision-making.
  * **Remote Work Experience:** Proven ability to operate effectively in a fully remote, distributed team environment.

### ðŸŽ¤ Interview Process

  1. **[30mins] Interview with the Talent Team**

  * This is our initial touchpoint. We're keen to understand your motivations and experiences better. As a tip, reflecting on why you applied for this role and being familiar with your application responses will be beneficial. 

* **[1 hour 30 minutes] Coding challenge (Front-end + backend)**

  * Youâ€™ll complete a pair programming exercise live, with two of our engineers. We will evaluate how you craft a web application, reason about it, and create a simple web server for the UI to consume. 

* **[1 hour] Interview with the hiring manager**

  * You will be speaking with the hiring manager about the role and expectations, discussing your past experiences, and touching on situational-based questions.

* **[30 mins] Interview with the CTO**

  1. The final interview will involve speaking with the CTO about your motivation for the role and will be a great opportunity to ask any questions you have about the business.

* **Decision**

  1. Weâ€™ll aim to come back to you with a timely decision and feedback on your overall interview process.

###  **About NALA**

Weâ€™re on a mission to increase economic opportunities for Africans across the globe, and weâ€™re keen to hear from capable, ambitious, and creative people who want to help bring this vision to fruition. ðŸš€

Our first product was a mobile money service in East Africa, which gained over 2,000 customers. Now weâ€™ve set our sights on building a bank for the African diaspora across the globe and our initial focus is on remittances. Weâ€™re currently launching an international money transfer service for African living overseas, who send money home to their loved ones.

_Weâ€™re backed by: Balderton Capital, Y- Combinator, Accel Partners, and several incredible fintech angel investors including the founders of Monzo, Comply Advantage, Luno, and Simple._

**What we are currently building ðŸš€**

We want to build a bank for the African diaspora globally, initially by starting with a cross-border money transfer service. We believe this is critical to solve to channel economic value back to the African continent. We believe using remittances is one of the best forms of true economic development and we would like to use it as an entry point before building new layers of financial services for the African diaspora.

At a starting point we are excited about:

  * Building Remittances 2.0 - we know remittance fees are a race to the bottom and believe the current model has some things that need to be changed. 
  * Enabling credit - for senders sending money back to Africa so they donâ€™t have to wait till they get their paycheck at the end of the month. 
  * Building infrastructure - enabling payments infrastructure locally in Africa. 
  * Building a community of African diaspora helping us build an incredible product together.
