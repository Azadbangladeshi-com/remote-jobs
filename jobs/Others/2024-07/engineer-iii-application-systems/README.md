### 2U  
#### `ðŸ’° $125,000-150,000` `ðŸŒŽ US-Remote`  

At 2U, we are all in on purpose. We are motivated by our mission â€“ to eliminate the back row in education â€“ and connected by our shared passion to deliver world-class digital education at scale. As the parent company of edX, the worldâ€™s leading online learning platform, 2U powers more than 4,000 online higher education offerings â€“ from free courses to full degrees.

**What Weâ€™re Looking For:**

The Applicant Systems team builds and maintains a critical suite of systems used to power University Admissions applications for dozens of partners and hundreds of thousands of applicants. Our apps touch front-end experiences, back-end data exchanges, and ops team admin features, and weâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s excited to work across all of it.

Weâ€™re looking for an experienced web application software engineer. We mainly use Ruby on Rails and we believe in the power of the majestic monolith. That being said, weâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s not afraid to get into the mix with other tools â€“ we also use Python for some legacy applications, and tend to pick the best tool for the job at hand (e.g. AWS Lambda and some limited micro-services). Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to both go deep in Rails and learn new tools and technologies.

**Responsibilities Include, But Are Not Limited To:**

  * Write clean, performant, well-tested code and refactor legacy code to improve maintainability
  * Lead technical design of applications and participate in larger system design efforts
  * Provide technical guidance and feedback to other team-members
  * Plan and estimate development tasks and short-term projects
  * Relate your project deliverables to the products you are building and the strategy behind them
  * Collaborate with product team (product managers, business analysts) to define and refine requirements
  * Efficiently debug complex problems
  * Collaborate with external stakeholders to resolve support tasks as the need arises

**Things That Should Be In Your Background:**

  * 4+ years experience with Ruby, Python, or similar
  * Strong grasp of Object Oriented Programming
  * Experience working with Ruby on Rails, or another MVC/MVT framework
  * Familiarity with AWS, including S3 and Secrets Manager
  * Some experience with JavaScript. ReactJS is a plus.
  * Experience with Kubernetes and Terraform are a plus
  * Background delivering quality software in a sustainable and timely manner
  * Prior experience leading cross-functional development initiatives and projects

**Other Attributes That Will Help You In This Role:**

  * Detail orientation 
    * Able to quickly understand business requirements and recognize when they are incomplete or ambiguous.
  * Strong communication 
    * Able to provide succinct updates on work progress and raise blockers early.
  * Leadership  

    * Being interested in mentoring more junior members and willing to advocate for better/smarter processes, system designs, architecture for the team and our services.
