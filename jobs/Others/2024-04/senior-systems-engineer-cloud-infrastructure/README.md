 **This position reports to** Sr. Manager, Systems Engineering Cloud Advancement Team

ServiceNow is changing the way people work. With a service-orientation toward the activities, tasks, and processes that make up day-to-day work life, we help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before.

ServiceNow has been serving customers for 17 years and has built a resilient and robust business, with a solid customer base. The Cloud Infrastructure Systems Engineering team at ServiceNow is looking for help to architect and build the server infrastructure and core services that allow our SaaS platform to run at scale and with high availability.

  * Is an excellent oral and written communicator
  * Has experience working with Agile software development methodologies (Previous SPRINT/SCRUM experience)
  * Has integrity, and honesty and can uphold ServiceNowâ€™s values

 **While these are not â€˜mustsâ€™, they are undoubtedly nice-to-have:**

  * Full time software development experience
  * Public cloud experience running production services at scale: (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.)
  * Public cloud experience with on-prem to Hybrid or full Public Cloud native migrations which include: Scoping/planning performance characteristics in the migration to Public Cloud infrastructures (IaaS or IaC)

  * Public cloud performance bottleneck troubleshooting, debug experience with control plane issues related to the performance of services or infrastructure running in the Public Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.)
