**The Community You Will Join:**

Everyone at Airbnb thinks about trust, but our team obsesses over it daily. The Trust team is responsible for protecting our community and platform from fraud while also ensuring our hosts, guests, homes, and experiences meet our high standards. Trust Platform is responsible for foundational systems that power the detection and mitigation of fraud at scale across Airbnb, such as the rules engine, friction framework, and the vendor API gateway, and supports one of the highest throughput systems across the company. The team works closely with the Trust defense teams to tackle the changing landscape of fraud attacks, and build platform features to enable Trust product teams to quickly build frictions, rules, and enforcement tools for agents.

**The Difference You Will Make:**

As part of the Trust Engineering team, you will be in charge of designing large scale systems to detect and mitigate fraud across our entire platform. You will be deeply involved in building highly available and real-time risk detection services in close collaboration with product, data science and operations teams to understand ever evolving attack vectors and to make Airbnb the most safe and trusted community. There are still many unsolved problems to tackle in both online and offline risk, and we're looking for talented engineers to solve these challenges with us.

**A Typical Day:**

  * Design, implement, and operate resilient and scalable distributed systems
  * Build and evolve platform capabilities to tackle the changing landscape of fraud attacks by collaborating with engineering teams in Airbnbâ€™s Trust, Payment and CSP organizations.
  * Provide critical input in Trust Platformâ€™s team roadmap and technical direction.
  * Identify opportunities to improve the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of Trust Platform services and drive their implementation.
  * Mentor other engineers in developing their technical and collaboration skills
  * Advocate and participate in efforts to advance Airbnbâ€™s engineering processes and technical foundations.

**Your Expertise:**

  * 5-9+ years of industry experience
  * BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience
  * Proficiency in one or more backend languages (Java/Ruby/Kotlin etc). Familiarity with Scala is a plus.
  * Experience with service-oriented architectures and developing large-scale distributed systems.
  * Experience with the Trust and Risk domain.
  * Hands on experience leading project teams and setting technical direction.
  * Experience with platform architecture patterns and best practices. Experience with building and leading infrastructure is a plus.
