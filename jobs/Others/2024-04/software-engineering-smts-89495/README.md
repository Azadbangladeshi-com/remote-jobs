Weâ€™re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way.

Monitoring Cloud is seeking engineers to architect, implement, deliver and operate our monitoring & analytic services that run in the public cloud at massive scale.

Monitoring Cloud is an integral part of the Salesforce Infrastructure that provides key insights for all development teams to quickly detect and remediate incidents to ensure the highest availability of Salesforce products for our customers. This cloud owns the entire telemetry stack starting with the agents that emit, collect and ship telemetry to large-scale backend systems that store data and enable efficient and low-latency queries to provide valuable insights. We support all the key pillars of telemetry - metrics, logs, traces and events at massive scale. Our teams have built these services using a combination of open source technologies and home grown technologies, both of which were essential at Salesforce scale and this has been architected from the ground up to run efficiently in the public cloud.
