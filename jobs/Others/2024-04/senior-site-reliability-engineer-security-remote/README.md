Description

As the leader in cloud-managed IT, Cisco Meraki connects passionate people to their mission by simplifying the digital workplace. Our impact is driven by the innovative, purposeful, and vibrant people who make up our inclusive community. When technology is intuitive, our customers can focus on what matters.

Our employees fuel the magic of the Meraki community. They have fostered an environment that empowers Merakians to challenge limits, embrace risks, and assist our customers in pursuing their missions.

Our guiding principles are rooted in our four core values: 'care deeply,' 'everybody in,' 'simplify everything,' and 'be brave.' These pillars have propelled us to the forefront of cloud-managed IT leadership and have played a pivotal role in shaping a more inclusive future for all.

In Meraki SRE we build the highly scalable cloud infrastructure that supports millions of Meraki devices worldwide. Merakiâ€™s customer base has grown by a factor of 2-3 every year, serving more than 8 billion HTTP requests per day across ten data centers! Our customers depend on our products to run their critical infrastructure of network switches (now including Cisco Catalyst in addition to the Meraki switches), security appliances, wireless APs, security cameras and sensors. In addition, Meraki offers a range of SaaS solutions on its Dashboard that greatly improves the insight and experience of IT departments around the globe.

The Infrastructure SRE team is responsible for the compute, storage and security underpinning Meraki's cloud in 10 data centers worldwide. Meraki's high growth rate means our processes must be automatic and efficient, never driven manually. Automation, monitoring and a keen eye for technical debt are key.

As a member of the team, you will craft and develop the global infrastructure which supports our cloud; this might mean deploying new Infrastructure management technologies at scale, writing code and using workflow orchestrators to improve our provisioning and decommissioning processes, or building models to predict business demand. You will also work closely with our vendors and internal Datacenter Operations team. We follow the *nix way (build large systems out of small components that each does one job and does it well. We run Debian and Ubuntu), automate tedious tasks and work almost entirely with infrastructure-as-code.

This role is to support a specific customer, and there is a 24/7 on-call requirement as part of a rotation. You will work with your team to deliver technical projects to support the wider business while spending a portion of your time working cross-team to support this critical customer.

#### Projects include:

  * Deploying and running IaaS solutions that let teams run seamlessly between our private cloud and AWS.
  * Using and running a workflow orchestrator (i.e. Luigi, Apache Airflow, Argo, etc.) to continuously reduce any manual work required to run our Infrastructure.
  * Security hardening for services, packages and processes, including OS images.
  * Building an automatic service lifecycle platform to coordinate the full lifecycle of all infrastructure (server, storage, network and site).
  * Deploying comprehensive monitoring tools to provide insight into the performance and reliability of our infrastructure.
  * Automating testing infrastructure to accelerate the velocity at which we can deploy changes.

#### You are an ideal candidate if:

  * Enjoy and have experience leading large technical projects - particularly working with cloud systems, networking, distributed systems, or data processing frameworks (ETL pipelines).
  * Have at least 4 years of experience 
  * Have experience running and/or developing highly scalable IaaS solutions.
  * Have experience with automation tools such as Ansible and Terraform as well as container technologies (Docker or similar).
  * Script or code with 1-2 languages like Ruby, Scala, and Python. Enjoy digging into other peopleâ€™s source code (even if you don't know the language) in search of the root cause of a problem. Instinctively write code to deploy and automate infrastructure.

#### Bonus points for:

  * Exciting personal projects or contributions to open-source.
  * Experience working with ETL pipelines.
  * Experience deploying HA services on K8s
  * Experience working with Cellery

 **Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada:**  
When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.
