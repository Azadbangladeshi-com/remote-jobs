**About the Work**

  
Weâ€™re seeking a Full Stack Developer experienced in Ruby on Rails and React. Youâ€™ll work on building out new features from start to finish, refining existing features, improving performance, and ensuring the security of our customerâ€™s data.

**  
  
What a typical week might look like** :  
  

  * Translating the product managerâ€™s feature pitches into technical specifications
  * Implementing those technical specifications as a series of small, descriptive, and well-tested GitHub pull requests
  * Pairing with your designer and developer teammates
  * Reviewing your teammatesâ€™ pull requests to increase the quality of what we build and learn from one another
  * Deploying to production with one click
  * Investigating customer-reported bugs that have been triaged and researched by our fantastic support team
  * Diagnosing errors that come in through our error monitoring tools
  * Improving performance guided by Datadog and AWS Performance Insights
  * Participating in book and code clubs to learn with/from other developers

  

**Who We Look For  
**  

  
We offer a culture that emphasizes continuous learning, work-life balance, and a meaningful impact on our customer community. Our **Core Values** shape our work:  
  

  * **Engage with Humility -** We actively participate with openness and receptiveness. We are ready to listen, learn, and speak thoughtfully and kindlyâ€”regardless of skill level, expertise, or place on the org chart.
  * **Invest in our team -** We give our time and energy to our teamâ€™s successâ€”improving collaboration with effective communication, making space for diverse perspectives, sharing knowledge, and asking questions.
  * **Do Our Best Work -** We aspire to do our best possible workâ€”continually looking for ways to improve the quality of our individual output and contribute to our team's overall success and growth.
  * **Focus on Customer Impact -** We advocate for our customerâ€™s best interests in our decision-makingâ€”we can trace the goal of every project back to creating positive value for our customers.
  * **Think Holistically, Work Iteratively -** We focus on taking practical steps towards our goals with an awareness of the broader contextâ€”thinking big, working small.

  
We believe the strongest teams comprise people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We're building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work. You'll join a company where your contributions are valued and your well-being matters.  
  

**The Hiring Process  
**  

  
During the hiring process, youâ€™ll have a chance to interact with several team members. We strongly encourage you to bring questions to each stage of the interview process. Youâ€™re interviewing us as much as weâ€™re interviewing you.  
  

**Applications will be accepted until 9AM PST on April 15th, 2024. We aim to have a final decision between May 10th and May 14th, 2024.** ** _Our teams will be at Product Summit between April 29th and May 2nd,_** **so there will be a brief pause in the hiring process between those dates. Our target starting date will be May 27th, 2024** ** _.  
_**  

  
Below is an outline of our hiring process.  
  

  * **Step One** : Apply with a resume and cover letter. **Your cover letter** ** _should speak directly to your interest in this position_** **. We want to know what got you into product development, how your experience has set you up for success in this role, and why you want to join our team.  
** _  
(A word of caution for those using AI cover letters: When compared to the hundreds of other candidates who did the exact same thing, it becomes painfully obvious who took the AI first draft. If you're going to use these tools, we ask that you use them well. Give our recruiter something a bit more human to read.)  
_  

  * **Step Two** : An invitation to an online coding assessment to get a rough understanding of your experience.
  * **Step Three** : Initial blind screen with our recruiter to get to know one another and discuss work and culture.
  * **Step Four** : Technical interview in CodeSignal with a few developers ( _You'll meet members of our team to discuss your work experience, methodologies, and ask lingering questions you have about us_ ).
  * **Step Five** : Pending all goes well, an offer will be extended.  
  

_* Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet ~60% of the criteria, women and those in underrepresented groups in tech, tend to apply only when they check every box. If youâ€™re unsure if your experience qualifies strong competency, weâ€™d still love to hear from you and see if you're a good fit!  
  
_ **Requirements**

  1. Reside in the United States
  2. Eligible to work in the United States ( _we are currently_ ** _unable_** _to offer employment to those with H-1B visas_ )
  3. Be willing to travel four times each year to connect with the rest of the team (not during a pandemic)
  4. Experience in **Ruby on Rails** and **React** , with strong competency in at least one.
