We are excited to welcome a **Staff Developer** to join our B2B Admin team here at 1Password and help us shape the way we serve the next 100,000 businesses & enterprises.

  

In this critical role, you‚Äôll be leading the overall technical direction of two teams each led by an engineering manager and tech lead. Both teams work on a similar domain, focusing on the B2B adoption of 1Password products throughout our customers‚Äô organizations and building everything from the Administration experience, to large scale enterprise-wide rollouts and migrations to 1Password. As 1Password adds more products to its suite and continues to serve larger and larger customers, there is a lot of potential for growth in this area.

  

As the Staff Developer supporting these two teams, you‚Äôll be responsible for the technical vision, maintaining alignment with our overarching business goals, while defining technical strategy and coding best practices. You will partner with your engineering teams, their Product Managers, and their Designers to create a strategy and set the technical direction for your domain, support the development of senior ICs, and ensure the teams have what they need to successfully deliver the right products on time. You‚Äôll be supported by your Director of Engineering and will be working closely with cross-functional leaders from Product, Design, Engineering, GTM and Customer Support, spanning time zones from the West Coast to Europe.

  

This is a remote opportunity within Canada and the US. You will be expected to be fully remote, ideally in the Eastern Time Zone, as well as periodic travel to meet up with leaders for on-sites.

  

 _We welcome applicants from all backgrounds, even if you don't tick every box for the skills we've listed. Diversity of experience and background leads to a stronger team, and we recognize that talent comes in many forms and that skills can be gained in various ways. If you're excited about the role and willing to learn, we still encourage you to apply._
