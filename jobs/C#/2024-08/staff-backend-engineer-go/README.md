**About the Team:**

At Netlify, our engineers are at the core of our mission to build a better web. We aim to create a better experience for developers globally by reducing friction and giving them autonomy, agency, and power so that they can innovate at the speed of light. We anchor our engineering teams around self-sufficient teams to drive developer productivity and enable us to scale, conquer, and divide. Netlify has been remote-first since our inception and we‚Äôre globally distributed, spanning across North America and Europe. We‚Äôre biased towards asynchronous planning and communication and take documentation seriously, meaning fewer meetings and more execution!

We solve problems across product development, infrastructure, and operations, serving everyone from large businesses such as Peloton and Verizon to small startups and nonprofits. Our challenges span the entire stack: from the way we cache the responses to safely executing custom user code within milliseconds, as close to the user as we can. We operate at scale, with daily traffic levels rising to hundreds of thousands of requests per second. We‚Äôre responsible for the infrastructure for our services as well as the services themselves.

To ensure alignment with this particular team, we are seeking candidates based in the USA, Canada, or the UK for this role.
