Kolide (by 1Password) is building device trust software for companies that value Honest Security. With over 450 customers and a novel approach to solving security and compliance concerns, Kolide is growing quickly and poised to take an industry-leading role in the coming years. To prepare, we are looking to responsibly grow our team in order to increase our diverse set of skills and perspectives. We are part of 1Password, a remote first company, and you can work from anywhere in the US or Canada.

  

Kolide‚Äôs mission can only be achieved with good ground truth, the practice of ethically collecting pertinent information, through direct observation. Ground truth is the foundational aspect of Kolide‚Äôs product.

  

We‚Äôre currently looking to welcome a Developer to our Device Agent team. Our team is directly responsible for collecting ground truth on Linux, Mac, and Windows devices. We accomplish this by working on Kolide‚Äôs agent (written in Go), or directly contributing to osquery (written in Objective C and C++). This often involves researching native APIs (or reverse engineering private APIs) to allow the agent to collect the data needed to further Kolide‚Äôs detection goals.

### What you can expect:

* Most importantly, your time is your own. Kolide‚Äôs agent engineering team has a single 1 hour meeting during the week to coordinate on engineering work. The Kolide team has two additional meetings each week, so we get some face time and stay aware of new customers and exciting developments. That‚Äôs it.
* Agents are complicated, and Agent Engineers are also responsible for ensuring they are good citizens on the devices they inhabit and are easy for our customers to install and manage. This includes auto-updating, native installation, code signing, uninstallation, persistence, and managing its overall performance. 
* **Here are some example projects that Kolide employees completed recently and are representative of the work:** Write tools to automate OS package generation for our agent, Research Linux disk encryption, and create tables to expose that state through osquery, Improve the reliability of agent‚Äôs auto update capability, Create a multipurpose library to convert complex data to EAV structure, Write a type-safe layer to allow interfacing osquery to the generalized WMI query interface, and Create a set of packages to facility remote collection of debugging information 
* While you will be working independently on projects, you won‚Äôt be on your own. As you make promising progress on a goal, other team members will be ready to assist you at your request. It‚Äôs rare in practice that a major new data collection initiative or major agent feature is driven from conception all the way to production without the assistance of others.

  

### What we're looking for:

* Device Agent Engineers with at least 2 years of general software development or SRE experience. You will be writing code primarily in Go, basic proficiency is required. There is additional work in C++ and Ruby. Some work is based in osquery, familiarity with it is a plus, but not required.
* You are naturally curious and relentless in finding the answers you seek. While this is a technical role that requires technical proficiency, we‚Äôve found in practice that people with this personality will be driven to acquire any skills needed to get to the truth.
* Experience using or administrating macOS, Windows, and Linux-based operating systems, and consider yourself a specialist in at least one of them. This could mean you have used Linux casually as your daily driver, but you have a lot of experience with the underpinnings of Windows as a developer or an administrator. We don‚Äôt expect specialist knowledge across every platform. (Windows is a plus)
* Familiarity with SQL. All of the queries we send to the endpoint are written in SQLite and understanding concepts like CTEs, casting, and aggregations, will help you decipher the more complex queries we send down to customer devices.
* You are a good writer who can write prose with empathy and tolerance for less technical people. Kolide is a product that interacts directly with our customers' end-users via Slack; it helps when our engineers can contribute to the writing process.
