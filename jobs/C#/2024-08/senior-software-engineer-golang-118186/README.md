### Stream  
#### `ðŸ’° 0` `ðŸŒŽ Amsterdam or Remote (EU and UK)`  

Stream uses Go for our video SFU & chat API. We power chat for many large apps like Strava, Nextdoor, Patreon, IBM, Adobe and Midjourney. In addition to Go we use CockroachDB/Postgres, RocksDB, Raft and Redis.

We are willing to train you on Go if youâ€™re experienced on a different tech stack (we have a 10 week internal onboarding program focused on Go, scalability etc.). Solid engineering experience and motivation to learn is more relevant than prior experience with the language. Roles open from entry level to director/principal go engineers. Remote (EU) or Amsterdam (relocation and Visa sponsorship available).
