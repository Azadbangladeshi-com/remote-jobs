## Description

Our mission

  

At Included Health, weâ€™re on a mission to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone. Weâ€™re a new kind of healthcare company, focused on breaking down barriers to provide high-quality care for every person in every community â€” no matter where they are in their health journey or what type of care they need. We offer guidance, advocacy, and access to personalized care for urgent care, primary care, behavioral health, and specialty care. Weâ€™re especially focused on increasing access to high-quality and culturally competent providers that can raise care equity for the LGBTQ+ community, Black Americans and other communities who have been historically disenfranchised and underserved in the US healthcare system.

  

Our team

  

Included Health is building a next generation healthcare technology and is looking for a software engineer to join the Cloud Platform team. The Cloud Platform team sits at the bottom of the stack, right above AWS, which enables us to build cross-cutting features across infrastructure, observability and security.

  

We are a fast, hard-working group with diverse backgrounds and deeply committed to our mission and our members. We believe shipping 80% of the value faster and learning is the best way to maximize impact. We also recognize that we wonâ€™t get technology, tooling or processes right on our first try and seek ways to continuously improve ourselves. We believe success comes from optimizing for the whole and welcome everyoneâ€™s ideas to the table. We focus on intentional growth so we can expand our skills and apply them to accomplish new goals and are dedicated to helping each other be our best.
