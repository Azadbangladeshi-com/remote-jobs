# [Software Engineer, Compute](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-compute-121978)  
### Vercel  
#### `ðŸ’° $174,000/yr - $235,000/yr` `ðŸŒŽ Remote - UK, Germany, Netherlands`  

## About Vercel:

Vercelâ€™s Frontend Cloud provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. Customers like Under Armour, eBay, The Washington Post, Johnson & Johnson, and Zapier use Vercel to build dynamic user experiences on the web.

At Vercel, our mission is to enable the world to ship the best products and that goes hand in hand with creating an environment where you can do the best work of your life.

## About The Role:

You will be part of a small but growing infrastructure team responsible for building and maintaining a platform to run compute workloads. The platform is currently powering all Vercel builds (1M+ builds per week in 2022), but we have more ambitious goals for it in 2024!

## What You Will Do:

  * Working collaboratively with cross-team and cross-functional stakeholders, you will participate in the conception and implementation of new platform features.
  * The platform you will be building runs all untrusted code from our customers: 1% performance improvements have massive repercussions across the board.
  * Manage our fleet of clusters, running 100â€™s of instances, deployed in every region where our customers deploy and run their code.
  * Build the most secure and performant networks to keep our customers code safe.
  * You will be writing Golang on a daily basis, while terraform will be your go-to tool when it comes to provisioning the needed infra.

## About You:

  * You have 5+ years of software engineering experience.
  * You have extended experience with Containers, Virtual Machines, Linux, and like digging deep to know how these things work under the hood (`tcpdump` and `strace` are your best debugging friends).
  * You design systems that improve performance or increase reliability. Or both!
  * You have built and operated distributed systems at scale.
  * Bonus points if you: 
    * have experience with schedulers and orchestrators for managing containers and non-containerized applications such as Nomad.
    * know how solutions like Deno subhosting work under the hood
  * You are willing participate in our (rather quiet!) on-call rotation.

## Benefits:

  * Great compensation package and stock options.
  * Inclusive Healthcare Package.
  * Learn and Grow - we provide mentorship and send you to events that help you build your network and skills.
  * Flexible Time Off - Flexible vacation policy with a recommended 4-weeks per year, and paid holidays.
  * Remote Friendly - Work with teammates from different time zones across the globe.
  * We will provide you the gear you need to do your role, and a WFH budget for you to outfit your space as needed.
