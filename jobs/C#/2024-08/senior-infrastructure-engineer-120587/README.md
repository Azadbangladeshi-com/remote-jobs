The real economy employs 3 billion people in frontline jobs, yet frontline teams are still left to choose between paper and Excel or decade-old workforce management solutions to take care of the most important part of their businesses - their people.

Enter Sona, the Frontline Operating System; an end-to-end platform to manage a shift-based workforce and empower its teams. Sona upgrades the functionality you expect from any workforce management software - including scheduling, time & attendance, HR, and Payroll - with industry-specific plugins, dedicated features to empower staff, and a consumer-grade experience that simplifies frontline work for everyone.

In just two years, weâ€™ve already made a deep impact on the lives of tens of thousands of frontline workers and the operation of their organisations, grown the team to 50+, and secured the backing of Googleâ€™s AI fund - Gradient Ventures, SpeedInvest, Notion Capital and angels like Tom Blomfield (Monzo).

Itâ€™s a hugely exciting time to be joining the team, as weâ€™re still small enough that youâ€™ll have a significant impact on the company, growth trajectory and culture, but large enough that we have a great structure, experienced leaders and world-class benefits in place (such as being fully remote and flexible, and only working 4.5 days a week). More on working at Sona here.

 **About the Role**

As our first dedicated Infrastructure Engineer, you will play a key role in shaping our infrastructure's future by owning our Kubernetes & GCP-based infrastructure, and our CI/CD processes.

You'll collaborate closely with our wider engineering teams to ensure our systems are secure, efficient, and scalable by refining our testing and deployment strategies, emphasizing developer experience and operational excellence.

With your help, we'll achieve end-to-end observability, robust incident management, and a forward-thinking data architecture that supports our mission to empower frontline teams.

 **Responsibilities**

Day to day, you will be:

  * Leading the development and maintenance of our Kubernetes and GCP-based infrastructure.

  * Enhancing our GitHub Actions-based CI processes and ensuring they are InfoSec compliant

  * Collaborating with engineering teams to optimize testing and deployment pipelines for the best developer experience

  * Implementing comprehensive observability to preemptively identify and resolve issues.

  * Managing alerting, incident management, and infrastructure-as-code practices.

  * Overseeing disaster recovery, backup procedures, and external penetration testing.

  * Acting as the technical lead for our information security policy development, including ISO 27001 and SOC 2.

  * Advancing our data architecture, leveraging BigQuery and Airbyte.

**Requirements**

We donâ€™t have strict requirements but hopefully lots of the following apply to you:

  * You're an expert in IAM within GCP, which we know is a high bar on its own! 

  * You're driven by the challenge of optimizing infrastructure to support exceptional software delivery.

  * You share our love of optimally using simple tools, rather than chasing the newest and shiniest

  * You take satisfaction in building rigorous processes and automation across infrastructure and security

**Benefits:**

  * Â£95-115k (or local currency equivalent)

  * 4.5 day standard working week 

  * Share options

  * Fully remote and flexible working

  * 35 days annual leave (25 days standard plus 10 flexible public holiday days)

  * Pension contributions matched up to 5% 

  * Comprehensive Health Insurance via Bupa

  * Enhanced parental leave & pay

  * Co-working space stipend

  * Quarterly all expenses paid team retreats

  * The latest Macbook and equipment for your home office

  * Professional development budget

  * Unlimited free books

 **Working at Sona**

We take our health and mental health seriously, believing that we can only perform to our best when we are healthy, happy, and in control of when, where, and how we work. That's why we're fully remote and everyone works a 4.5 day week (you choose when you take the half day) with a fully flexible schedule.

We balance this with regular virtual stand-ups and all-hands so we're all aligned, and paid-for, in-person meet-ups so you can get to know your colleagues.
