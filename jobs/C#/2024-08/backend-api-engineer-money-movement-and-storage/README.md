## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

We are part of the Money Movement and Storage (MMS) organization that is working towards a future in which all of the complexity that comes with handling money (e.g. accepting different currencies, adopting new payment methods, integrating with hundreds of banks globally) is abstracted away from Stripeâ€™s users. This team is core to Stripeâ€™s business and thousands of developers will use our platform and infrastructure to create valuable products and services that billions of people use. Our team works with product engineering and infrastructure teams across Stripe to build the platform that powers money movement for many of Stripeâ€™s Products like Connect, Issuing, and Corporate Card. Ultimately, our goal is to increase the GDP of the internet by making it easy to build global products, services, and platforms that handle money.

_We are hiring for multiple teams within the MMS organization and we will determine exact team alignment in the final stages of the process._
