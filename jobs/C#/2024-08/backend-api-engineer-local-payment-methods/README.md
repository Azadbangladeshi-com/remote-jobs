## Who we are

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

Stripeâ€™s payments products have helped to accelerate many of the worldâ€™s most innovative companies, and the BNPL/Wallets team maintains some of Stripeâ€™s largest consumer payment methods, processing billions of dollars in payments annually.

BNPLs and digital wallets are newer entrants to the payments space (vs credit cards), and as consumer products they evolve quickly. The team is focused on making these methods easiest to use for consumers and easiest to enable for merchants, and working with partners to continue to improve those areas.
