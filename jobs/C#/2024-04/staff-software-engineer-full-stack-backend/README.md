Description

Over the last 11+ years, Ellevation Education has built a thriving business serving the administrators, teachers, and specialists who support English Learners at public schools across the US. Today, over 1,500 school districts use our software to manage their EL programs. We are a successful, rapidly growing business with a real mission -- helping English Learners achieve all they possibly can.

  

As the Staff Software engineer for our instructional product domain, you‚Äôll work alongside our engineering managers and our two instructional product teams to create value. We‚Äôll ask you to primarily focus on the backend (Python, Postgres, AWS Lambda) but you should also be comfortable with the front end (React).

  

We look for engineers who are excited to use their technical skills and experience in support of a mission-driven company. We work in small, product-centric teams empowered to make a difference in a particular product or aspect of a product. Our teams are remote and highly collaborative. To accomplish this we set core hours of 10AM - 4PM (Eastern) and expect to meet in person about 4 times per year (whether at our Boston Headquarters or at one of our semi-annual company offsites)

  

We are looking for someone who is comfortable generating options, weighing tradeoffs, and assessing risks, but also loves to get in and code. You excel in finding development paths that incrementally deliver value while keeping an eye toward broader goals. You should be comfortable in any part of the stack, going deep as necessary.

  

As a Staff Engineer, you‚Äôll also be a key contributor to the broader discussions that guide the overall evolution of Ellevation‚Äôs architecture and, in so doing, you‚Äôll help people across the engineering team level up on complex system design and implementation. We look for experienced engineers who are excited to use their technical skills and experience in support of a mission-driven company.
