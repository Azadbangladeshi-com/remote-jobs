### Aledade  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Austin, TX`  

## Description

As a Staff Software Engineer, you will take us beyond traditional monolithic SQL engines and batch pipelines. You will build the next generation of distributed data storage and processing systems. You will build systems that can scale indefinitely, and surpass traditional query performance, while making the interfaces for that data simple, expressive, and cleanly abstracted. Your interfaces will support a broad array of data consumers, from our web application, to business analytics, and artificial intelligence.
