#### **Role overview:**

As a Staff Software Engineer within the Video team, you would take responsibility (along with a small team) for the design and implementation of this integral part of our video platform.

Video lies at the heart of the Gather experience, providing a low-latency, seamless experience for the spontaneous interactions we're known for. Our video infrastructure handles thousands of concurrent users, spanning all continents of the world.

Unlike traditional room-based video infrastructure, our video infra allows any two users to have an audio/video connection in an instant ‚Äî enabling experiences where a speaker can address a large audience while the audience remains quiet to the speaker, yet the audience can still mingle amongst their neighbors, just like in real life. Our self-operated video infrastructure spans 10 data centers and features a custom SFU architecture.

#### **Where you will make an impact:**

  * Deliver the tastiest, most appealing video frames our users‚Äô internet connections can endure
  * Optimize our video servers until they laugh with glee at the notion of having hundreds of simultaneous meeting participants
  * Re-architecting our video system to implement SFU-cascading. We need to design and implement backhaul of video between SFU instances, picking the most efficient network path.
  * Degrade quality with grace for bandwidth or CPU-constrained devices, and handle spurious spikes in latency/congestion with a shout of ‚ÄúNot today, internet weather!‚Äù
  * Build tools that guide us to our goal of an exceptionally reliable meeting platform
  * Instrument our service until it looks like a time-traveling Delorean you saw in those movies
  * Build automated tests that ensure the reliability and performance of our video infrastructure as we make it more awesome

#### **What you bring:** **  
**

  * Experience working on a large-scale group video calling platform (e.g. Zoom or Google Meet)
  * Experience working with WebRTC, either directly or with libraries that use it
  * Intrinsic motivation and drive to solve difficult problems without guidance
  * A keen intuition for well-designed software
  * Ability to thoughtfully stack your priorities in an ever-changing startup environment
  * Excellent interpersonal and communication skills

#### **US Salary Range**

At Gather, compensation may vary outside of this range depending on a number of factors, including a candidate‚Äôs qualifications, skills, competencies and experience, and location. The base salary range for this position in the selected city is **$187,850 - $237,575** annually and we encourage candidates outside of this salary range to apply.

Base pay is one part of the total package provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work, and this role will be eligible for a stock reward reflective of an early-stage startup.

  * Work remotely out of a state-of-the-art virtual office!
  * Competitive compensation, benefits, and meaningful equity
  * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees and their dependents
  * 401k and matching program
