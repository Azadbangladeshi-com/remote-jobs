 _Your career is an investment that grows over time!_

  

Wealthsimple is on a mission to help everyone achieve financial freedom by reimagining what it means to manage your money. Using smart technology, we take financial services that are often confusing, opaque and expensive and make them transparent and low-cost for everyone. Weâ€™re the largest fintech company in Canada, with over 4 million users who trust us with more than $50 billion in assets.

  

Our teams ship often and make an impact with groundbreaking ideas. We're looking for talented people who keep it simple and value collaboration and humility as we continue to create inclusive and high-performing teams where people can be inspired to do their best work.

  

About the Infrastructure Team

  

Foundational to all of Wealthsimpleâ€™s inner systems are teams that are devoted to ensuring that our applications are stable, scalable, performant, resilient, and reliable. Currently this area contains Reliability Engineering and Infrastructure Platform. Both teams work together to provide developers with the platform, tooling, and guidance to build, test, deploy, and monitor world-class solutions in the financial services industry.

  

The value that this area provides to other developersâ€”and ultimately to Wealthsimple clientsâ€”is a strong, opinionated approach to running services in production. Through various efforts, we accelerate development while increasing reliability and scalability of all services. We make it easy to deploy safely, monitor, and test all systems at Wealthsimple.
