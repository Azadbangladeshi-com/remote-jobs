  * Troubleshoot production issues by performing triages for issues that arise, assessing the impact, creating and executing a plan for short-term and long-term mitigation, and performing root cause analysis to prevent future occurrence of issues.
  * Coach/mentor junior team members in their assigned engineering projects by reviewing and providing feedback on code developed, and performing design and code reviews
  * Work with senior leadership to turn technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter
