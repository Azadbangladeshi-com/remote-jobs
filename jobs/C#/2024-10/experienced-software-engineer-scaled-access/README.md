## Description

We believe that the way people interact with their finances will drastically improve in the next few years. Weâ€™re dedicated to empowering this transformation by building the tools and experiences that thousands of developers use to create their own products. Plaid powers the tools millions of people rely on to live a healthier financial life. We work with thousands of companies like Venmo, SoFi, several of the Fortune 500, and many of the largest banks to make it easy for people to connect their financial accounts to the apps and services they want to use. Plaidâ€™s network covers 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada, UK and Europe.

The Scaled Access team enables financial institutions to quickly develop financial APIs compatible with Financial Data Exchange (FDX). We believe that by enabling more self-serve onboarding for Financial Institutions, we can scale Plaidâ€™s ability to work with even the smallest data suppliers and institutions allowing us to better provide financial freedom to everyone.

  

As a member of the Scaled Access team, you will be leading development of product features with complex backend components: data accuracy and service reliability are the highest priorities in these features that have real-life impact on tens of millions of users. You will also influence the team to make the right technical decisions in our backend services and keep evolving the architecture for long term success. Your leadership skills will help us break down silos, fostering open communication and knowledge sharing that lead to effective collaboration.
