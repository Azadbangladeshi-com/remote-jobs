We're on a mission to help engineers understand and scale their systems, applications, and teams. We operate at high scale ‚Äî trillions of data points per day ‚Äî allowing for seamless collaboration and problem-solving among Dev, Ops and Security teams globally for tens of thousands of companies. Our engineering culture values pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity to solve hard problems the right way.

_At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them._

**The Team:**

Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) allows customers to manage application security risk with continuous, real-time monitoring of vulnerabilities and threats against your web applications, serverless applications, and APIs, in production. Automatically integrated with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) distributed tracing and code-level context, Application Security Management empowers development, operations, and security teams to build and run secure applications in production.

**The Opportunity:**

We are looking for a software engineer to work on our open-source Go library. On top of working on the daily life of this open-source project, it includes working on the development and integration of our security monitoring features, such as the detection of attacks or exploits, thanks to the ‚Äúsecurity engine‚Äù built inside the library. Last but not least, it also involves making the onboarding experience easier and more seamless, collaborating with the Go ecosystem and language.  
Come and join us to build amazing open-source software!

**What You‚Äôll Do:**

  * Develop mainly in Go.
  * Instrument Go source code at compilation time to be able to monitor Go services at run time.
  * Contribute to the architecture, design and implementation of ASM for Go.
  * Work closely with the many ASM library teams (1 per language we support) through working groups (aka squads) and RFCs.
  * Collaborate with the ASM backend teams on new product ideas.
  * Ensure that your quality criterias are met thanks to our shared testing platform, health metrics, performance monitoring metrics, etc.
  * Write code that instruments thousands of Go services around the world.
  * Learn about the Go internals and its runtime.
  * Closely collaborate with the Datadog Go Library Squad, including the APM Go Tracing and Go Profiling teams.

**Who You Are:**

  * You have professional experience programming in Go, or polyglot with no trouble adjusting to Go.  
For each language you know, you think idiomatically to leverage the best features of the language for a particular problem.

  * You have experience with compiled languages.
  * You have experience with multi-threading, concurrency and parallelism.
  * You favor readable, robust, reliable code and put that in practice by writing clean, correct, tested, performant, and idiomatic code.
  * You have experience with Go packages and modules, and their maintenance, such as releasing them or updating go.mod files.
  * You care about performance, both in regard to time and space, and have experience in measuring and optimizing code to that end.
  * You keep yourself up to date in library ecosystems and language communities, and you're not afraid to dive into the code of your dependencies to get the best understanding of their behavior.
  * You work openly and collaboratively with your colleagues.
  * You have a BS/MS/PhD in a CS/STEM field or equivalent experience.

_Datadog values people from all walks of life. We understand not everyone will meet all the above qualifications on day one. That's okay. If you‚Äôre passionate about technology and want to grow your skills, we encourage you to apply._

**Bonus Points:**

  * You‚Äôre a fluent Go programmer: you avoid pitfalls and quirks of the language like callback hell, object mutation, and tricky asynchronous code; you dived into some of the Go internals; you use modern syntax and language features.
  * You have experience with widely used Go web frameworks (like gorilla, gin, echo, chi‚Ä¶).
  * You keep yourself up-to-date regarding the Go language, its ecosystem and community.
  * You have experience interfacing Go with foreign code thanks to CGO.
  * You have experience with code rewriting, AST transformation, or compilers.
  * You have experience with GitHub and GitHub Actions.
  * You have experience in maintaining open source projects.
  * You have experience with customer support.

**Benefits and Growth:**

  * Skilled, knowledgeable, and kind teammates to work with and learn from.
  * Interesting challenges of all sorts. You‚Äôll gain experience with runtime internals, low level OS details, and how to safely ship software that runs within customer processes at scale.
  * Opportunities to contribute to open source software.
  * You‚Äôll have a lot of influence on product direction and impact on the business, especially since we continue to grow quickly.
  * Competitive global benefits.
  * Continuous professional development.

  
_Benefits and Growth listed above may vary based on the country of your employment and the nature of your employment with Datadog._
