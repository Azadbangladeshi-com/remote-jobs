For many organizations, the most valuable asset is their data. Whether source code, product designs, customer records, financial results, or pricing models, every organization has information they donâ€™t want to get in the hands of competitors, sold on darknet marketplaces, or exposed publicly. Keeping that data safe has been a challenge, until now. Cyberhaven gives organizations the tools to safeguard their data from theft or misuse. In the process, weâ€™ve become the standard for Data Detection and Response (DDR), the category we helped create.

We need you to make sure we are shipping a shiny and polished product, free from hitches, glitches, snags, hiccups, crashes, or any other defects. You'll be architecting and developing a safety net that makes it hard for bugs to sneak through. This involves contributing to our modern test automation platform. You won't be afraid to speak up for quality when a deadline is approaching and there is pressure to roll features out. Youâ€™ll be in close contract with the development and product teams as well as company founders and executives.

Exciting stuff is waiting for you! Weâ€™ve got a pretty cool tech stack over here and making sure everything is tested inside out is not exactly a routine task. Thereâ€™s a rich UI, a microservices-based backend with steep performance and scalability requirements, deep integration with Windows, macOS and Linux, and a diverse set of cloud APIs for integration with SaaS applications.

 **What You'll Do**

  * Develop automated test frameworks that will allow running end-to-end tests, backend API-based tests, performance tests and testing of our AI data lineage engine.

  * Develop automated test frameworks that leverage AI.

  * Run and integrate automated tests in CI.

  * Implement new automated tests and maintain the existing batch of automated end to end tests.

  * Help prepare product releases.

  * Participating in product management discussions, keep close track of how the product specifications are implemented.

  * Following product deployments at customers.

 **Who You Are**

  * A software developer with experience in architecting and writing automated end-to-end tests.

  * Proficiency in at least one of our primary programming languages: Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), or Golang. (We primarily work in these languages, but you don't need to be an expert in all 3, having solid ground in at least one of these is a key for the role)

  * Passionate about coding and creating innovative solutions!

  * Break-it mentality: can identify, anticipate, and prevent subtle software defects and various corner cases where things can go wrong.

  * Experience with techniques for automatically testing Web and desktop applications.

  * Expertise in modern CI/CD methodologies and tools, particularly Github Actions.

  * Attention to detail and focus on the highest product quality standards.

  * Knowledge of REST APIs and client-server architecture.

  * Comfortable working in a fast-moving environment.

  * Excitement to work with a dynamic team.

  * Excellent written and spoken English.

  * Nice to have:

    * Experience testing Kubernetes infrastructure-based backends.

    * Experience testing AI products.

 **What we offer**

  * Competitive compensation, based on experience.

  * Stock options â€“ get your part of the success of the company.

  * Excellent benefits such as private health insurance.

  * Flexible schedule.

  * Great office space and support to make sure you can comfortably work from either home or the office, depending on your preference.

 **Interview process**

We would like to get to know strong candidates in depth, therefore we will go through a thorough interview process, among which there is also a take-home coding challenge as well as the opportunity to speak to multiple members of the team. We will also be conducting reference checks.
