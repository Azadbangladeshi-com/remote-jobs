#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,NYC or Remote`  

## Description

At Olo we develop an online food ordering platform used by many of the country's largest restaurant chains, reaching millions of consumers. Chances are if you've ordered directly from a restaurant brand's app or website, we've made that happen.

  

As part of the Ordering Scale and Performance team, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us scale one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the market. You will develop, scale, and monitor solutions, improvements, and services across our ordering platform, as well as work closely with experienced senior engineers across multiple teams to ensure the components our team owns can handle current and future levels of load and that we can meet or exceed the performance levels our customers have come to expect from us. This will be a blend of short-term tactical fixes, tweaks, and optimizations, as well as longer-term, strategic initiatives that will leverage advanced techniques, tools, patterns, and practices.

  

At Olo, we aim to collaborate well, as well as encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the codebase is off-limits. We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration and encourage constant refactoring. As an Olo Software Engineer, you'll work with a passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern technologies.

  

You will report to an Engineering Manager and can work remotely from anywhere in the U.S. or at Oloâ€™s headquarters in NYC.
