### City State Entertainment  
#### `üåé United States`  

### Company Description

Unchained Entertainment is an independent video game development studio founded in March 2011, in Fairfax, Virginia. The studio embodies an ‚Äúopen office‚Äù collaborative process where all team members are expected to contribute to the design and the development process. The team has built a next-generation engine tentatively titled the "Unchained Engine" which is powering their two games in development - Camelot Unchained, a niche RvR old-school MMORPG (currently in Beta) and Final Stand: Ragnarok, a PvE looter-slasher in which teams of any size fight against hordes of NPCs (currently in very Early Access on Steam).

### Job Description

Unchained Entertainment is looking for two Mid-level Gameplay Engineers to help create Camelot Unchained. You‚Äôll work primarily within our server code to implement features from combat to crafting to guilds. You can also expect to make forays into client code to expose those features to the user, although you can leave the hardcore engine development and final UI polish to others.

### Qualifications

  * Fluency in C++, C#, or Java
  * Avid and thoughtful gamer, especially of MMORPGs
  * Strong data structures and algorithm skills
  * Broad general understanding of game systems such as combat, physics, and pathfinding
  * Knowledge of network programming considerations

### Additional Information

### Big Advantages

  * Experience with both C++ and C#
  * Experience with JavaScript and web development
  * Strong 3D math skills (linear algebra, calculus, trigonometry)
  * Prior experience creating client/server systems
  * Experience with metrics and analytics, especially in games
  * Understanding of distributed systems
  * Mastery of threading and concurrency
  * Prior experience and expertise in a specific specialty such as AI, physics, or combat
  * Prior shipped titles in the game industry
  * 5-7+ years (depending on experience) of game development, preferably in the MMORPG space

### Little Pluses

  * Experience with MongoDB or other document-oriented data stores
  * Degree in computer science or a related field
  * Experience with functional programming (LISP, OCaml, Haskell, etc.)

Note: Unchained Entertainment is hiring for a broad range of positions on a growing team. We have definite skill and task needs, but the eventual division of tasks within the team will depend on the eventual team members. If you‚Äôre an outstanding and talented individual whose qualifications fall halfway between two of our listings, we‚Äôd still like to hear from you. All candidates must have excellent written and verbal communication skills. We are an emphatically equal-opportunity employer.
