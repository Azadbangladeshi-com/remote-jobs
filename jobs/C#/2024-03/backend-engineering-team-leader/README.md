### At M-KOPA we are looking for Team Leads to join our both Retention and Portfolio product groups. Brand new roles for 2024.

 **Don't have an up-to-date resume, but think this looks awesome, no problem, we have a space on the form for that.**

 _"Leading a team you will work as a servant leader, coach and contributor within a team which places emphasis on high quality output using infrastructure as code, observability and monitoring as well as automated testing in all environments, including production"._

At M-KOPA we deploy multiple times per day, and you will be empowered to drive the architecture of our new fleet of microservices. We use predominantly C# written against the latest .NET stack, and favour microservices hosted on Azure using Kubernetes for all new implementations. We are constantly iterating towards a completely decoupled, event driven architecture across our entire software portfolio.

These are **fully remote roles** , within the following time zone (UTC -1 / UTC+3). Our engineers work remotely from locations such as UK, Europe and Africa. You will be reporting to the group Engineering Manager.

We have a mix of legacy services and greenfield microservices, so if you love the challenge of improving a legacy codebase while working on new projects, and if working remotely full time appeals, this might be a job for you.

### Flexible

 **Are you looking for an opportunity to work in a company where progress, and humility are valued as highly as technical excellence?**

Where we use the latest technologies and architectures to build fantastic customer experiences with a socially and environmentally conscious mission that echoes throughout the organisation.

Our expectations are that you would be comfortable working as part of a team which owns the entire software stack, including the supporting infrastructure, throughout the entire software lifecycle from inception, through production and right the way to decommissioning under a DevOps culture. If you also value the constraints that continuous delivery places upon engineering processes and embrace testing and observability as first order concerns in the development of software, you probably have what it takes to join the team and shape our future.

### Why M-KOPA?

At M-KOPA, we empower our people to own their careers through diverse development programs, coaching partnerships, and on-the-job training. We support individual journeys with family-friendly policies, prioritize well-being, and embrace flexibility.
