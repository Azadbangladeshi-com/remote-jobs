### FuturLab Ltd  
#### `ðŸ’° 140000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

Weâ€™re FuturLab, the award-winning game studio behind PowerWash Simulator, the Velocity series, Peaky Blinders Mastermind, and many more awesome games.

Weâ€™re looking for an experienced Lead Programmer to join the team/exciting world of PowerWash!

If you take just as much pride in optimising workflows as you do in coding the perfect water flow â€“ then we are looking for you! The PowerWash Simulator team at FuturLab is seeking an experienced Lead Programmer to head up a talented team of over 10 programmers on our live, multiplatform game. Working closely with the leads of multiple disciplines, youâ€™ll help build the vision of the game, ensuring it becomes an actionable technical design that will deliver a quality experience for our players.

The successful candidate will have shipped at least two titles, with at least one being a multiplatform project. Experience with post-launch support and updates is very welcome, especially on consoles. As well as being extremely well-organised, weâ€™re looking for someone who is kind and patient.

As a remote-friendly studio, we are pleased to offer remote working wherever possible. This role can be fully remote, based out of our sunny seaside office in Brighton or a mixture of both!

At FuturLab, we believe patience is as good for our games as it is for our people. Therefore, we are a no-crunch studio, with a focus on wellbeing. You can read more about life at FuturLab here.
