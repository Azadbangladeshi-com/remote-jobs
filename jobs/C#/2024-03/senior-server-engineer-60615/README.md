### Company Description

Unchained Entertainment is an independent video game development studio founded in March 2011, in Fairfax, Virginia. The studio embodies an ‚Äúopen office‚Äù collaborative process where all team members are expected to contribute to the design and the development process. The team has built a next-generation engine tentatively titled the "Unchained Engine" which is powering their two games in development - Camelot Unchained, a niche RvR old-school MMORPG (currently in Beta) and Final Stand: Ragnarok, a PvE looter-slasher in which teams of any size fight against hordes of NPCs (currently in very Early Access on Steam).

### Job Description

Unchained Entertainment is looking for a senior server engineer to help define and build our game server architecture. This position will go deeper than just gameplay, to make sure we're balancing our loads, maximizing our thread usage, and minimizing our bandwidth usage.

  * Expert data structures and algorithm skills

  * ### Prior game development experience

  * Experience with network and client/server programming

  * Understanding of dynamic distributed systems

  * ### Mastery of threading and concurrency

  * Broad general understanding of game systems such as combat, physics, and pathfinding

  * Experience with databases

### Little Pluses

  * Experience with MongoDB or other document-oriented data stores

  * Degree in computer science or a related field

  * Experience with functional programming (LISP, OCaml, Haskell, etc.)

Note: Unchained Entertainment is hiring for a broad range of positions on a growing team. We have definite skill and task needs, but the eventual division of tasks within the team will depend on the eventual team members. If you‚Äôre an outstanding and talented individual whose qualifications fall halfway between two of our listings, we‚Äôd still like to hear from you. All candidates must have excellent written and verbal communication skills. We are an emphatically equal-opportunity employer.
