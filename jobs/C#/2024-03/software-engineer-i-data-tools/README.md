Description

Our Team

  

What problems have you solved with data? What problems have you helped others solve with data? If you have spent any amount of time turning data into actionable insights you understand that success is conditioned on finding and fixing the problems with your data and then connecting the data-derived insights to business goals. Achieving this in a timely, repeatable manner is hard. Doing so in a world where data access is highly democratized and users can slice and recombine data in ways you may not have imagined is harder. Successfully turning messy, often unstructured healthcare data into insights and actions which improve well-being and medical outcomes at scale is so hard that it so far has remained elusive.

  

  

Data Tools owns the suite of tools which gather, clean and conform member medical data and turn that data into insights and metrics. Our tools empower Data Science, Analytics and Product teams to build personalized member recommendations, alert medical providers to potentially undiagnosed health problems, and report on our ability to deliver highest quality medical outcomes in a cost effective manner to our clients among others, all while adhering to the highest data privacy and governance standards.

  

Your focus will be on building out our suite of tools to make working with data natural for both data producers and consumers. Your projects could include:

  

-Integrating our common data model with open source tools Datahub and Querybook.

  

-Developing a streaming event framework to allow data produced by our mobile apps to flow into the common data model.

  

-Implementing data validation concepts into our data ingestion and transformation tools.
