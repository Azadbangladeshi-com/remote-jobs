 ** **About the Role:****

CrowdStrike is looking for 2 Cloud engineers for the summer of 2024 to join our growing Spotlight Engineering Team within the ITSecOps Organization. Our new colleague will be responsible for building globally distributed, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable cloud ecosystems using Golang. Prior experience with Golang is not required, but will be helpful.

This role is for the team that builds Falcon Spotlight product. Spotlight is cloud-native, instant visibility and vulnerability intelligence for all endpoints regardless of location or platform, running on a Unified EDR/VM agent monitoring continuously in a "scan-less" architecture, in a single pane of glass.

Zero impact on performance â€” Searches take place in the cloud and have zero impact on endpoints and the network. Our team of backend-focused developers works primarily in Golang, operating under the modern 'end-to-end ownership' model that requires full lifecycle ownership of your services, and makes use of distributed/microservices-based architecture to build features for our highly available cloud SaaS, the Falcon Platform.

 ** **Don't worry if you don't know Golang, we will teach you!****  

If you are a hands-on engineer who wants to operate at scale, apply & let's talk!

CrowdStrike is a computer security company, but we do not require candidates for this role to have prior security industry experience. We will mentor and train in security topics as needed. We do expect a strong interest in CrowdStrike's mission and a willingness to engage with the needs of our product teams and customers.
