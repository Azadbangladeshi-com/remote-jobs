  * Excellent programming skills in one or more of the following programming languages: C#, Go, TS/JS, Solidity, Rust, Python, Java, Kotlin, but will also considerother tech stacks.
  * Proficient in a smart contract programming language (eg. Solidity, Cairo, MOVE) with extensive experience in developing complex smart contracts. Familiar with toolings such as Foundry, Hardhat or Remix.
  * Ability to implement efficient algorithms and design complex data structures
  * Understanding of good software architecture and engineering process
  * Ability to write clean, testable, and maintainable code without over-engineering
  * Deep understanding of Ethereum blockchain architecture
  * Understanding of the DeFi landscape, such as lending protocols, AMMs, Perps and stablecoins
  * Experience in developing off-chain applications that integrate with web3 protocols, using libraries such as Web3.js and ethers.js.
  * Strong computer science background

**Other Competencies:**

  * You need to be a self-starter, with the curiosity and drive to continuously improve.
  * Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, with attention to detail
  * Strong written and verbal communication and collaboration skills
  * Proficiency in English

**Nice to have:**

  * Knowledge in Traditional Finance, and the intersection between traditional finance and blockchain, such as Tokenisation.
  * Experience with layer-2 solutions like Starknet, Optimism, zkSync, and Arbitrum
  * Familiarity with blockchain data analytics tools like Dune and Nansen
  * Knowledge of cryptographic primitives like hashing and signature schemes
  * Familiarity with formal verification methods for smart contracts
  * Experience in front-end development with frameworks like React or Angular
  * Familiarity with smart contracts auditing tooling/techniques (e.g Fuzzing, Symbolic execution, Static and Dynamic Analysis)
