### Job Description

As a Senior Backend Engineer within our Product Foundation Tribe, you'll play a key role in laying a secure, compliant, and efficient foundation that enables the rest of the organization to innovate with confidence. Your work will directly impact Scalableâ€™s foundational product components, ranging from user authentication to our client onboarding journey and our internal backoffice platform.

We're looking for bar-raisers - engineers who go beyond the code to influence the direction of our products. Your curiosity will lead you to explore customer needs firsthand, contributing to a team that values a business mindset. As we deal with a user base in the millions, we place a strong emphasis on process optimization, aiming to constantly improve how we manage our work and serve our customers.

Our engineering DNA is woven from a few vital strands: diversity, lifelong learning, humility, hard work, ownership, and collaboration. We welcome individuals from all cultural backgrounds, enriching our already diverse environment. The right person should demonstrate an intrinsic motivation to learn continuously, stay updated with trends, and apply new knowledge innovatively. Ownership is key, too; we look for individuals ready to take responsibility and accountability for their tasks. And finally, we need collaborators - those who take responsibility for the health and success of the team, are comfortable leading from any position, and are unafraid to have serious conversations when necessary.

  * Drive full-cycle development of scalable, reliable, and high-performance solutions, focusing on Java, Kotlin, and Spring technologies.
  * Align your work with the Product Foundation Tribe's mission to provide a secure, compliant, and efficient foundation, optimized to onboard and serve millions of clients.
  * Leverage our cloud-native, DevOps-enabled infrastructure, working with AWS services like ECS, Fargate, and Lambda.
  * Contribute to a culture of diversity, lifelong learning, and collaboration.
  * Understand our customers' needs and provide relevant info for data-driven decision-making processes.
  * Think in terms of processes to manage our ever-growing user base, aiming to continuously improve and innovate in how we operate and serve our customers.

### Qualifications

  * Extensive backend development experience with a strong grasp of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
  * Proficiency in one or more backend programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Typescript, Python, C#, etc.).
  * Familiarity with Spring Framework and Spring Boot is a plus but not required.
  * Profound understanding of RESTful API Design.
  * Experience with cloud services, particularly AWS services like ECS, Fargate, and Lambda.
  * Strong understanding of DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure management.
  * Advocacy for and experience in Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming, with the willingness to champion these practices within a team unfamiliar with their benefits.
  * A "left-shift" quality mindset, emphasizing the importance of quality assurance in the early stages of the development cycle.
  * Demonstrable experience in full-cycle development, from concept to deployment.
  * Excellent communication skills with an ability to engage with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  * Strong problem-solving skills, with an emphasis on process optimization and performance improvement.
  * Familiarity with monitoring tools and setting up SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs is a plus.
  * A mindset geared toward lifelong learning, diversity, and collaboration.
  * Ability to take ownership of tasks and projects, and hold yourself accountable for their success.
