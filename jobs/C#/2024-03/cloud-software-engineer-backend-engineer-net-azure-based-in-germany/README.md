About us  
  
Hey, nice to meet you and welcome to Loady!  
  
As a startup, we have developed a solution to make supply chain logistics more digital, efficient and sustainable - and this worldwide!  
  
Did you know that the industry still handles important data for the planning and execution of transports as it did 25 years ago? Manually and completely unstructured, which repeatedly leads to misunderstandings and inefficiencies during transportation. We simply had to find a solution and change this!  
  
Now, for the first time, Loady allows companies to manage their logistics requirements in a structured and standardized way and share them directly with their business and logistics partners. Loady also offers a variety of web-based online views and, of course, interfaces to ERPs, TMS, YARD, etc.  
  
Join us! Together we make Loady a real win-win for the entire industrial logistics sector, across all industries and worldwide.  
  
We are a young, international, very professional team and work from anywhere in Germany. We are actually in constant contact virtually and meet up every 2-3 months at our cool location in Mannheim. Micromanagement is not our thing: we rely on agile methods, self-organization and direct, open communication channels. We also offer the option of "Work from Everywhere in the EU" for up to 60 days a year.
