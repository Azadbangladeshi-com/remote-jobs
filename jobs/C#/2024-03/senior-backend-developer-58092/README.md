# [Senior Backend Developer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-backend-developer-58092)  
### AppyWay  
#### `💰 165000.0` `🌎 United Kingdom`  

### Who we are

AppyWay started life as AppyParking. An app born out of the daily frustration of finding and understanding parking on-street across London. From humble beginnings, our parking app went on to be crowned the UK's best and we built the UK’s largest set of standardised kerbside data, a quest that led us to realise the untapped potential lying under everyone’s feet. With a vision for more liveable and thriving cities, our obsession turned to the kerb.

Today, our platform is helping digitise kerbside management, providing local authorities with innovative products that are transforming traffic regulation orders (TROs) and enabling intelligent parking solutions. For the private sector, our Parking API and mobile apps are unlocking value for businesses across the UK by providing contextualised parking insights for their operations.

AppyWay is proud to count local authorities like Milton Keynes, Harrogate, Coventry, Southwark, Cornwall, Dorset and Haringey as clients, alongside the thousands of drivers and field services fleets leveraging our apps and API.

We're backed by a number of leading investors. To date, we've raised over £20 million, with the support of blue-chip investors who back our vision including Sumitomo Corporation, Hyundai Motor Company, Aviva Ventures, West Hill Capital, and Breed Reply.
