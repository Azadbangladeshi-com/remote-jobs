**How you’ll make an impact:**

With more and more data initiatives becoming mission strategic, and with the rise of diverse AI regulation frameworks around the globe, governance is turning out to be more crucial than ever. But that’s a tough and complex area for the companies: different systems to monitor and to interact with, stakeholders from across various departments, policies and processes to enforce transversely.

Our mission in the AI governance team is to make that easy and efficient by providing our customers with a customizable platform that allows them to implement their in-house processes and strong integrations to oversee all of their data initiatives.

Our technical stack is composed of a Java backend supported by a PostgreSQL database and a web frontend developed in modern Angular. Our architecture is oriented toward exposing services, for both interaction with the frontend and with external applications.

**Some expected outcomes for this role:**

  * Turn ideas or product specifications into full-fledged product features, including unit and end-to-end tests.
  * Tackle complex problems that range from performance and scalability to usability, so that complicated machineries look straightforward and simple to use for our users.
  * Help your teammates: review code, spread your technical expertise, improve our tool chain
  * Bring your energy to the team!

**What you need to be successful:**

  * You are mastering a programming language (Java, C#, Python, Javascript, You-name-it, ...).
  * You know that low-level Java code and slick web applications in Javascript are two sides of the same coin and are eager to use both.
  * You are not surprised that “Math.max() < Math.min()” is true in JS
  * You have a first experience building a real product.
