About Mashgin

At Mashgin, we are developing the future of checkout experiences. We aim to reduce the friction between customer desires and their ability to be on their way.

  

In May 2022, Mashgin closed a Series B funding round at a $1.5B valuation. We are backed by some of Silicon Valleyâ€™s leading investors including Matrix Partners, NEA and Y Combinator. Our ecosystem is anchored by the only 3D computer vision and deep learning based checkout system in the world. We have 2,000+ locations world wide with customers across a wide spectrum of verticals including the NFL, MLB, Circle K, ampm, Aramark and Compass Group.

  

We value autonomy of ones work, a culture of respect for one another, and building products with empathy for our customers.

  

Position Summary

Weâ€™re looking for a full-stack developer to help us build the software that runs our kiosks and powers the extensive infrastructure behind them. In addition to building more traditional web stacks, youâ€™ll work on code that interfaces with our hardware and visual components, making sure kiosks are extra reliable and the user experience amazing. This is not a specialized position -- we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects, so youâ€™ll be involved throughout the entire product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping while contributing to many different parts of the codebase in multiple languages.

  

This is a remote, contract position in Brazil. Mashgin is headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.
