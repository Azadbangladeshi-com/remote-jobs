What's an Agile developer's favorite superhero? Spider-Man â€“ because he knows the importance of _agility_ in saving the day!

Our client is not seeking Spider-man (yet); they are looking for an experienced and dedicated Agile Software Developer to join their team. In this role, you will be responsible for designing, coding, testing, debugging, and documenting .NET/C# software applications based on business requirements and technical design. Their ideal candidate is someone who sees the bigger picture and understands the diverse environments and uses of the application they work on. The challenge is the complexity of the business scenario, and having a good idea of where you stand & how you make an impact. This company's colocation and edge infrastructure is comprised of over 60 data centers in 20+ different markets. They facilitate server, data, and application management for some of the world's biggest industry names.

Familiarity with Angular or JavaScript is a strong asset, and experience with the OutSystems platform and MS SQL Database will be advantageous. The work environment is collaborative and Agile, involving contributions to all stages of the software development lifecycle.

This companyâ€™s main application is becoming their legacy one, since itâ€™s scheduled to be replaced with a more modern version. In the meantime, they require someone who can take ownership of this application, including maintaining these services, implementing enhancements, and adding new features based on internal unit needs. Occasional troubleshooting is necessary, emphasizing the importance of efficient task completion. Youâ€™ll also be collaborating with the newer application, but your main focus will be the one that is live for now.

**Responsibilities:**

  * Design, code, test, debug, and document software applications using .NET, C#, Angular, or JavaScript.
  * Participate in all stages of the software development lifecycle using Agile Scrum methodologies.
  * Develop and maintain SQL Server databases, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.

  * Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to standards and code quality.
  * Resolve application defects, bugs, and technical issues.
  * Work closely with stakeholders to understand and translate software requirements into technical designs.
  * Continuously explore and implement new technologies to enhance development efficiency.
  * Participate in Agile Ceremonies (backlog refinement, planning, sprints, status meetings, retrospectives, etc.)
  * Collaborate with team members and other teams to ensure completion of work in line with acceptance criteria and direction.
  * Identify and document defects associated with application development and customer use.
  * Provide progress updates to Team Leads and raise concerns about impediments to timely work completion.
  * Demonstrate high accountability and ownership for individual and team success in product delivery.

**Requirements:**

  * 5+ years of professional experience in developing software applications using .NET, C#, Angular, or JavaScript.
  * Experience in Agile/Scrum development methodologies.
  * Familiarity with the OutSystems platform and MS SQL Database is advantageous.
  * Strong ability to debug code, solve problems, and optimize code for performance and scalability.
  * Good understanding of software design patterns and architectural principles.
  * Solid comprehension of the full software development life cycle.
  * Excellent teamwork skills, flexibility, and the ability to handle multiple tasks.
  * Be available for meetings and collaboration within the Eastern time zone.
