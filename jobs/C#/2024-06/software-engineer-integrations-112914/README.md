* Gather and refine specifications and requirements based on technical needs, working with web designers to match visual design intent
* That means estimating methodically based on iterative learning (setting realistic deadlines that drive effort but also good work habits).
* Triage and correct performance and/or data integrity concerns by reviewing and evaluating code, data patches, system logs, and process/memory/disk consumption utilization.
* Collaborate with other engineers on features and support cases, and as you continue to develop, support technical decision-making, leading and supporting work that affects more and more complex systems and critical areas of our application
* Create and maintain software documentation
* Maintaining, expanding, and scaling Versapay solutions as we grow our customer base
* Remain plugged into emerging technologies/industry trends and apply them to operations and activities

* Strong organizational skills to juggle multiple tasks within the constraints of timelines and budgets with business acumen
* Ability to work and thrive in a fast-paced environment, learn rapidly, and master diverse web technologies and techniques
* You don't shy away from detective work and problem-solving (even when the answer isn't obvious); finding solutions to problems excites you and you're comfortable with the unknown and ambiguous
* You're analytical and able to look at situations from multiple vantage points to make data-driven decisions and solve real problems
* You're able to deliver communications that are clear, concise, and effective, both written and verbal to get your ideas across and get buy-in if needed

We look for excellence: individuals that are better than we are and not only meet our values but bring value to our teams.

  

Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. Think you have what it takes, but not sure you check every box? Apply to the role anyways. We‚Äôd love to talk and determine together whether you could be a great fit!

  

We are committed to providing an environment that is inclusive and accessible. Versapay is an equal opportunity employer and considers all applicants for employment without discrimination. Please let us know if accommodation for the recruitment/interview process is required and we will work with you to make sure your needs are addressed.
