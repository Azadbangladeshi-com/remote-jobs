### ClassDojo  
#### `ðŸ’° $171,500/yr - $244,000/yr` `ðŸŒŽ San Francisco, Remote`  

ClassDojo's goal is to accelerate humanityâ€™s progress, by giving every child on Earth an education they love.

We started by building a network that connects teachers, children, and families. ClassDojoâ€™s flagship app is the #1 communication app connecting K-8 teachers, children, and families, globally. They use it to share whatâ€™s happening throughout the day through photos, videos, messages, and activities. It is actively used at an unprecedented scale: in over 95% of US schools, reaching ~51 million children in ~180 countries, with a team of just ~200 people [1]). We are now beginning to use this network to give kids the best learning experiences in the world, far beyond those a standard school can provide.

We hire for talent density. Our team comprises the most experienced, entrepreneurial, and innovative teammates from around the world, with experience in education and large scale consumer internet companies, including Instagram, Netflix, Dropbox, Stripe, Uber, Y Combinator, and more. Weâ€™re building a company where the most talented people want to work. We believe youâ€™ll do the best work of your life hereâ€”and youâ€™ll pioneer the future of education, too..

### **What youâ€™ll do:**

**Improve our platform**

  * Write, debug, and optimize code for our platformâ€”the infrastructure that all of the rest of our teams depend on
  * Collaborate with your team and other teams through pair programming, mob programming, code reviews, and design sessions
  * Seek out opportunities to provide shared value through improvements of our common systems, tooling, and practices
  * Support and improve our build and delivery pipelines
  * Contribute to technical design and architecture conversations with your expertise and perspective

**Contribute to better practice, processes and teamwork**

  * Help to unblock teammates as well as other teams through hands-on work and guidance.
  * Break work down so we can make improvements incrementally
  * Help grow other engineers into more senior engineers.
  * Systematically improve the quality of our product and process.
  * Encourage collaboration and psychological safety.

**You will be a match if:**

  * You have 10+ years of professional software experience. More than 2 of those years were in a role that focused primarily on infrastructure/platform.
  * You have made an impact in the organizations that you've joined.
  * You have driven technical excellence through improvements to process, practices, and tools (e.g. experience with test automation, CI/CD, and DevOps practices)
  * You have strong communication.
  * You're excited to get things done in a fast-paced environment
  * You have an ownership mindset: you are comfortable with both responsibility and accountability
  * You're thoughtful about creating and maintaining a world-class engineering culture
  * You enjoy working in a pair programming environment
  * You are passionate about education and care about having impact on tens of millions of kids' lives with your work
  * You live and work in the Americas timezones
