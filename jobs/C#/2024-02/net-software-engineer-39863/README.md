Your Opportunity

Innoactive is a key player in the enterprise XR software market and committed to deliver outstanding and scalable cloud solutions for VR, AR and 3D application deployment. Our mission is to make XR accessible with one click. We are looking for a open-minded and passionate .NET engineer (remote) to complement our distributed team.

As a .NET engineer at Innoactive and part of our product development team, you'll play a critical role in the development of (Windows) desktop and web applications that enable users to access XR content with one click â€“ either remotely rendered and streamed from the cloud to any device or rendered locally on the userâ€™s workstation. Youâ€™ll be responsible for designing and implementing features for the .NET-based desktop client application as well as the capturing and streaming application. In your work, you'll closely collaborate with our backend and frontend engineers to evolve the back-end services (Python and Django, .NET Core) of our platform as required. Youâ€™ll jointly work with a team of polyglot developers with backgrounds in the DevOps, Backend and Frontend space and be responsible for delivering high-quality software products in a cutting-edge technological environment. At Innoactive, you can push the borders of whatâ€™s currently possible. If you are a quick learner, self-
motivated, and able to work independently, have a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for your work and are comfortable working remotely, you may well be ideally suited for this position.
