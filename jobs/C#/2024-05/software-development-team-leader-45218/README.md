**Job Responsibilities:**

The Product Consolidation Stream Team works to bring together our product estate into a unified tech stack and user experience. They work closely with the rest of the Stream teams to bring legacy solutions up our latest standards.

You will:

  * Work closely with your Product Manager to prepare and deliver value for the team‚Äôs domain. This will involve creating a strategy and roadmap aligned to the business needs.
  * Work closely with your team and the Technology Enablement group to create the team charter and tech strategy. Then implement it.
