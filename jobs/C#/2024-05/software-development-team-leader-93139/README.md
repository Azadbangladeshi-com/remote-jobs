**Job Summary**

  * Work closely with your Product Manager to prepare and deliver value for the team‚Äôs domain. This will involve creating a strategy and roadmap aligned to the business needs.
  * Work closely with your team and the Technology Enablement group to create the team charter and tech strategy. Then achieve it.
  * Set the bar for best practices in the team: coding, testing, deploying, operating as well as team processes for self-organising and continuously improving. You are the advocate for engineering excellence in yours and across teams.
  * Coordinate with other Team Leads, PMs and ‚Äúguilds‚Äù as needed to deliver work, resolve dependencies and align practices and standards.
