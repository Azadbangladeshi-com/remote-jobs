## **Why this job is exciting**

Source code is at the heart of Sourcegraph. We support multiple code hosts and retrieve, store, index, and serve source code - to end users, admins, and other internal services. Our latest addition to our product catalog, Cody, reimagines how code is written and supercharges our developer customers. Sourcegraph hosts the infrastructure for our customers to manage their source code (search, insights, own, etc.) and our brand new AI Code Assistant (Cody).

This role gives you the opportunity to solve complex, challenging, and highly technical problems for our customers, both internally and externally, help unleash the potential and productivity of our Engineering teams, and delight our customers with industry-leading quality software.

The Cloud Operation team primarily focuses on building a fully managed platform for using Sourcegraph, Sourcegraph Cloud, our SaaS offering. As a member of the Cloud Ops team, you will work closely with both external customers and internal stakeholders to meet their needs. You will:

  * Develop inter-cloud connectivity solutions to support enterprise customers from highly regulated industries to use Sourcegraph Cloud.
  * Build a control plane to orchestrate a fleet of single-tenant Sourcegraph Cloud instances. 
  * Expose complex infrastructure as API to support internal customers to iterate faster.
  * Dive into upstream dependencies (e.g., CDK for Terraform, Terraform providers for GCP) to debug and patch non-trivial problems.
  * Be an advocate for building reliable services and work with leadership to help product teams achieve operational excellence. 
  * Participate in on-call rotation to uphold our contractual SLA commitments.

üìÖ Within one month, you will‚Ä¶

  * Onboard onto the Sourcegraph architecture, tooling, and development workflow.
  * Build a solid understanding of the team‚Äôs areas of ownership, technical challenges, and problems the team solves for our customers, and know how all of these align with the top-level company goals.
  * Actively participate in team meetings, sharing ideas and insights to contribute to the overall team goals.
  * Start contributing to the team goals and deliverables by shipping new features, debugging issues, and fixing bugs.

üìÖ Within three months, you will‚Ä¶

  * Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the Cloud infrastructure, its underlying technologies, and its integration within the Sourcegraph ecosystem.
  * Lead initiatives contributing to team goals through both discovery and delivery phases, collaborating directly with product and design partners, other engineering teams, and non-technical stakeholders from different departments.
  * Contribute to the architectural design and implementation of new features or improvements, actively shaping the future direction of Cloud infrastructure based on customer needs.
  * Lead initiatives contributing to team goals on the roadmap by going through the entire product development lifecycle discovery, design, implementation, and delivery.
  * Participate in our on-call rotation.

üìÖ Within six months, you will‚Ä¶

  * Be defining long-term technical vision and strategies for new product development, scaling existing services, and managing technical debt. These plans will consist of multiple smaller milestones, which you will deliver with the team iteratively.
  * Collaborate with the Engineering Manager on defining the team‚Äôs growth strategy based on the long-term product vision, the technical vision, and the team‚Äôs needs.
  * Seek feedback from customers and stakeholders to identify opportunities for further improvements or new features, actively iterating on the Cloud infrastructure to ensure it continues to meet our high bar.

## **About you**

You bring a product mindset in balancing architectural flexibility and philosophy with meeting immediate customer demand. You are an experienced software engineer who looks to solve problems through writing code rather than one-off operations. You are passionate about user experience and self-service. You balance maintaining and designing high-impact systems with a pragmatic understanding of how to make appropriate tradeoffs (e.g., cut scope, low-tech vs. custom complex solutions) to ship quickly and iterate when necessary.

Qualifications:

  * Proficiency in Go, or other strongly typed languages.
  * Knowledge in one of the public cloud platform providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)
  * Experience with Terraform (or similar IaC solutions) and Kubernetes to build tooling and automation.
  * Skilled at debugging distributed systems followed by designing and implementing solutions to those problems. This means you should know your way around various OS-level primitives, e.g., network, CPU, and memory.
  * Ability to communicate clearly and empathetically, especially in writing and documentation.
  * Preferred time zone between UTC-8 and UTC+2

Nice to haves:

  * Built services and exposed them as API for external consumption (e.g., gRPC).
  * Comfortable implementing system-level software (e.g., custom transport protocol) if needed or has contributed to Kubernetes controllers/operators.
  * Published blog posts and/or tech talks about your work.
  * Experience working on small high-performing teams, preferably tech startups.
