### About us

ClearBank was built on the belief that banking infrastructure would no longer slow down progress. Instead, itâ€™s the catalyst that unlocks the potential to innovate. Thatâ€™s why our clients â€” financial institutions from fintechâ€™s and crypto platforms, to banks and credit unions â€” use our API to power their banking infrastructure.

But we wouldnâ€™t be ClearBank without our people. Theyâ€™re what powers our innovative technology and the reason we love what we do every day. Weâ€™re a group of spirited people who are never afraid to challenge the norm â€“ becoming stronger, more energised, and that much better when weâ€™re together. Itâ€™s our belief in fairness, autonomy and choice that means our people are empowered with the tools to learn, grow, and contribute to ours and our clientsâ€™ success. Interested in joining us?
