# [Senior Software Engineer - Platform Federal](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-platform-federal)  
### Grafana Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States (Remote)`  

### This is a remote role for the US timezones only

#### About our Platform (at Grafana Labs):

Grafana Cloud moves millions of metrics, log lines, and traces per second from our customers' environments into a highly available, low-latency stack that processes and stores these data, and serves them to dashboards and alerting tools. We aim to grow this to hundreds of millions per second, and it's critical that as we grow, we improve our performance, increase our reliability, and, of course, do it efficiently and effectively.

The Internal Engineering Platform delivered by the Platform department provides application engineers with the tools, systems and Kubernetes clusters they need to build, deploy and run their workloads. Platform roles at Grafana Labs have an eye for engineers with a passion for performance and reliability, and who enjoy taking projects from conception to production. We organize ourselves into squads to allow focus on Cloud Infrastructure, Networking and Security; engineering Productivity; Capacity management, Client Administrative Tooling (CAT); and US Federal compliance.

Because we deploy production services, we have on-call rotations to ensure the health of the system. Everyone at Grafana Labs tries to incorporate and use our product line up into their day-to-day, so being on call is an important way to understand our system and how people use our products.

#### About the team & the role:

The Platform Federal squad owns and maintains both the platforms supporting Federal customers and deploying and operating Grafana Labs services on top of it. We host highly automated, immutable services in Kubernetes on the main Cloud Service Providers.

We are looking for an experienced software, site reliability, or platform engineer to join us. You would be an early member of the squad, giving you a great opportunity to have impact and an outsized contribution to the culture and success of the team as it grows. We have a unique, vibrant and pro-innovation engineering culture that we wish to maintain in the tightly regulated Federal world, and you would be key to this success.

#### Responsibilities

  * Deploy and manage platforms supporting Grafana Labs' US Federal customers
  * Provision and administer the core infrastructure platform, Kubernetes and CSP resources.
  * Deploy and operate our products on top of the platform in concert with the application teams.
  * Develop, maintain and improve the monitoring, automation and supporting services needed to align Federal operations with our strongly DevOps, high ownership and autonomy culture.
  * As the team grows, mentor peers and assist with technical product leadership and roadmap planning.

**Applicants must be a US citizen and based in the USA.**

#### Who Are We Looking For?

  * You enjoy working with engineers, as well as with the management structures that are there to support you and enable you and your team to do your very best.
  * You are **comfortable working in a remote-first company** ; communication is key. For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind, and respectful. We operate by consensus, you can contribute to a discussion but then commit to the team decision.
  * As such, being such a highly distributed company, means we would love someone who is keen on working with **distributed systems** , too.
  * You are eager to **learn and grow**. There is a lot of room for growth and development, and the team has quite a lot of knowledge to share for those who are wanting to learn.
  * You approach development **holistically**. The team owns the full life cycle of our code; from writing design docs, to looking at developer feedback, and integration testing. We appreciate engineers who enjoy looking at the big picture, and also notice the details of the brush strokes. The Platform team mainly works with Go, Python, and Shell.
  * You have experience with **operating your code**. Since a lot of operators and developers use our software, having some grounding in both of these spaces really helps us with building better platforms for our users. Kubernetes and Docker are what we use, mostly. We also work with a lot of Infrastructure as Code, so be sure to check out grafana/tanka.

#### Some skills/experience we like to see:

  * Commercial experience as a site reliability, network or software engineer in managed k8s, Cloud and Linux environments, especially with distributed architecture.
  * Programming experience -- we use Go, Jsonnet, Python and Shell.
  * Experience with containers and orchestration -- we use Docker and Kubernetes.
  * Proficiency with IaC or config management, we use Terraform, Helm, Tanka and Jsonnet.
  * Experience with dashboards and monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus.

#### Nice to have:

  * Experience operating FedRAMP, DISA IL2-6 or other relevant US Federal accredited products.
  * Commercial experience operating on AWS GovCloud and other CSP alternatives.
  * Commercial experience in designing and managing networking in a Virtual Private Cloud.
  * Commercial experience of network services, including load balancers, firewalls and DNS.
  * Experience working in remote and/or distributed business environments, demonstrating self motivation and communication skills.
