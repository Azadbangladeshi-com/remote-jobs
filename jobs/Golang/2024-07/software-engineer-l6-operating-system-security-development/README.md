## Description

At Netflix, we want to entertain the world and are constantly innovating on how entertainment is imagined, created and delivered to a global audience. We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 250 million paid subscribers and are expanding into new forms of entertainment such as gaming.

  

Open Connect (OC) is a critical group within Netflix that builds and manages a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers all of Netflixâ€™s streaming video. In addition to streaming video, we work on projects within Netflix that leverage physical infrastructure, such as our Cloud Games and Live initiatives. According to a 2023 Sandvine report, data delivered by OC accounts for approximately 15% of all downstream traffic volume across the entire internet. Most of this traffic is delivered by our edge cache servers.

  

A small team of talented software engineers develop and maintain the operating system that runs the content caches. Because of the important role these caches serve, it is critical that they be both efficient and secure.

  

We are looking for a Security Software Engineer to architect and implement security features for the OC edge appliances and have the opportunity to directly impact a critical area of the business.
