# [Software Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-116412)  
### Temporal Technologies  
#### `üåé United States - Remote Opportunity`  

We have an opening on our SDK team to hire a **Software Engineer** to help us build a great experience for developers of Temporal-based applications. Our SDK team makes the Temporal SDKs and the Temporal CLI‚Äîthe primary ways through which our customers use Temporal. This is harder than it sounds‚ÄîSDKs are not mere clients; they act as runtime environments for application code, and coordinate closely with Temporal Server to provide the durable-execution guarantees our customers require. Most of our work is open source‚Äîsee for yourself here: https://github.com/temporalio

**What You Will Do**

  * Design and build Temporal SDKs used by customers to work with Temporal in their programming language of choice.
  * Tightly integrate Temporal SDKs with their respective languages to run application code in a durable, deterministic way.
  * Maintain and improve the Temporal CLI and VSCode IDE plugin.
  * Work directly with our community to debug issues that need expert attention, and get feedback on Temporal SDK features and APIs.
  * Write publicly-readable technical documentation describing Temporal concepts and APIs.
  * Travel to meet your coworkers in meatspace for a week once or twice a year.
  * Attend the occasional developer conference to talk about how great Temporal is (optional).

**What You Won‚Äôt Do**

  * Work in an office (unless you want to, but you‚Äôd be by yourself). Temporal is a fully-remote company.
  * Commit code that‚Äôs poorly-tested or works ‚Äúmost of the time‚Äù. Temporal aspires to be ‚ÄúReliable as Gravity‚Äù, and we expect your code to be the same.
  * Overwork yourself to meet a deadline. Instead of crunch time, we cut scope.
  * Work behind closed doors. The SDKs are open source‚Äîthat means PRs and comments are open to the public, too.
  * Sit in meetings all day. We mostly communicate in writing, and use meetings mainly for status updates and thorny issues that need input from the whole group.
  * Wake up to pager alerts. We‚Äôre extremely active in supporting the community, but we don‚Äôt do 24/7 on-call.

**What You‚Äôll Bring**

  * BS or MS in Computer Science (or a closely-related degree), or equivalent work experience writing production-grade software.
  * Fluency in multiple programming languages, and an affinity for learning new ones. We don‚Äôt care which, but you should know at least two.
  * Familiarity with concurrent programming‚Äîyou should know how to use mutexes and atomics safely.
  * Familiarity with distributed systems‚Äîyou should know what to do when you can‚Äôt rely on mutexes and atomics.
  * A methodical, detail-oriented approach to your work.
  * A deep sense of ownership and personal accountability‚Äîyou care about the impact of your work, and if something goes wrong, you take responsibility for making it right.
  * A proactive approach to managing your work‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to balance working autonomously vs. working closely with others, and recognize when you need help.

**Nice to Have**

  * Familiarity with Temporal‚Äôs programming model (e.g. you‚Äôve written an app on Temporal).
  * Experience writing in Go, Java, Python, .NET, TypeScript, Ruby and/or Rust.
  * Experience contributing to open source projects.
  * Experience designing APIs and writing documentation for publicly-usable libraries/modules.
  * Experience contributing to the architecture and design of large-scale distributed systems.
  * Deep knowledge of language runtimes‚Äîparticularly related to sources of non-determinism.
  * Strong technical communication skills‚Äîwritten and verbal‚Äîin English.

### **Compensation**

  * The estimated pay range for this role is $125,000 - $175,000.
  * Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Temporal's equity plan.
