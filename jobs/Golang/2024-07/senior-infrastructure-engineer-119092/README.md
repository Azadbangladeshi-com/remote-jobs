  * Develop automation using Infrastructure as Code and Configuration Management principles to build, deploy, and configure infrastructure components in a consistent and reproducible manner.
  * Create comprehensive support documentation, and high-level-architecture diagrams.
  * Collaborate closely with Technical Operations and Support teams to facilitate seamless integration and continuous improvement.

### **What You'll Bring**

  * At least 7 years in a Senior Systems Administration, Datacenter Operations, or similar role, with a deep understanding of Linux/Unix systems and private and public cloud technologies.
  * Experience deploying and managing hypervisors, bare-metal servers, and traditional infrastructure components.
  * In-depth knowledge of infrastructure and application availability, with considerations for scalability, high-availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, and cost analysis / optimizations.
  * Experience configuring standalone and managed SQL and NoSQL database technologies (Postgres, ScyllaDB) is an asset.
  * Proficiency in automation and configuration management tools (CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, Consul), observability tools (Elk, grafana, victoria metrics), and in programming languages such as Python, Go, or JavaScript. Familiarity with containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.
  * A proactive mindset with a hands-on approach to problem-solving, capable of innovating under pressure and committed to reducing risks and technical debt.
  * Excellent communication skills, with the ability to collaborate effectively across teams and with various stakeholders.
