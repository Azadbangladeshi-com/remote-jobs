Note: This role is for an AI/ML infrastructure engineering team, not an applied machine learning team. This team does not build ML models for specific applications. The team is focused on the infrastructure products that help our customers do machine learning and data science at scale. Experience with ML or data platforms is helpful to understand our customer use cases, but your team will not do any applied ML.
