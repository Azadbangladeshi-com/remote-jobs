### Hunter  
#### `ðŸŒŽ France`  

### **Description**

Hunter's Engineering department is hiring a Senior Back-end Engineer! You will work on the Hunter back-end, which is at the heart of our publicly sourced database of Companies and People.

We love working as a small group and don't hire frequently; this is a rare and exciting opportunity to join us. You'll be part of the Data team alongside Bernardo and Fayzan, our seasoned Golang developers and AI enthusiasts.

We have set up a great work environment focused on autonomy and growth. We emphasize asynchronous communication and keep meetings to a minimum to maximize efficiency.

Hunter is a fully remote company, and this is a remote job. It is open to anyone located in Europe.

 **About the role**

Our back-end foundation is built on a robust Golang monolith that scans billions of web pages monthly. On top of it, we rely on a bit of Python for our AI-related workloads. Both create a streamlined yet powerful setup that boosts our productivity while keeping our team lean. Our priority is to devise the most effective and elegant solutions for large-scale challenges.

As part of a small team within a fast-moving company, you will work on various projects over time, but you can expect that:

  * At first, youâ€™ll become familiar with our processes for gathering, analyzing, and structuring data from billions of Web pages.
  * Within a few weeks, you'll become responsible for significant projects that will improve Hunterâ€™s database at scale. These projects can involve implementing a new AI-based data pipeline, tuning our Golang application's performance, or improving our Quality Assurance.
  * You'll collaborate with the rest of the Engineering team to gradually improve our data quality and quantity.
  * Youâ€™ll monitor and troubleshoot back-end processes, resolving any issues or bottlenecks that may arise.
  * You'll get a high level of autonomy in your work and help shape future development efforts.

**About us**

Hunter is the go-to platform for salespeople, marketers, and recruiters looking to connect with key industry players. With our straightforward yet powerful tools, we provide access to B2B data compiled from billions of public web pages, formatted for ease of use.

We are the most popular platform for cold email outreach. Our product is used by over 4 million people and leading companies such as Google, Adobe, Microsoft, and IBM.

Hunter was founded in 2015 and is a bootstrapped company. Our team comprises 20 people working remotely from Europe, America, and Asia. Twice a year, the team meets in a company retreat in Europe.
