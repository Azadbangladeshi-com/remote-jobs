###  **Job Description**

Overview

We are seeking a skilled and experienced Network Engineer to join our team. In this role, you will be part of the AI & Cloud Engineering (ACE) Division and AI Workbench team. Our AI Workbench is a cloud-based environment to accelerate Automotive AI Software Development and Evaluation. The AI Workbench has 4 main functional blocks today, with one of those blocks providing access to both SILS (Software in the Loop Simulator) and HILS (Hardware in the Loop Simulator).

As a Network Engineer - ACE, you will be responsible for designing, implementing, and managing our network infrastructure for our board farm. You should have a strong background in networking technologies and excellent problem-solving skills. You will work closely with multiple engineering teams (and cross-function teams) to align on both high-level network architecture, security policies, and implementation details.

Our divisionâ€™s mission is to use the latest AI and cloud technologies to develop the best AI inference for advanced driver safety engineers building self-driving vehicles and other high performance compute products. Renesas is the leading automotive electronics supplier globally, and this is a rare opportunity to develop the infrastructure required to deploy our AI software to the billions of devices we ship to customers every year. You will join our newly formed AI & Cloud Engineering organization of around 100 software engineers. Due to strong demand for our AI-related products we are planning to triple in size in the next three years, so there is lots of room for you to help us grow the team together while remaining small. Our teamâ€™s key locations are Tokyo, London, Paris, Dusseldorf, Beijing, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City and other metropolitan areas, but you can also join fully remotely from other locations globally or get our support to relocate to our key hubs such as Tokyo.
