 **We put people first. Itâ€™s all about you..**

At UW, we prioritise not just what we deliver, but how and with whom we work. Our passion lies in tackling complex challenges alongside bright minds, recognising that true fulfilment comes from overcoming obstacles. By maintaining lightweight processes and fostering autonomy, we ensure swift delivery without compromising quality. Leadership at UW isn't about lofty ideals but about getting hands dirty, providing guidance, and fostering a culture of support. We champion experimentation, shun egos, and value open discourse, collaboration, and continual learning. With Go as our primary backend language and React + TypeScript for frontends, our infrastructure, managed through Kubernetes across multiple clouds and an on-prem cluster, underscores our commitment to efficiency and scalability. At UW, if it's open-source worthy, it's open-sourcedâ€”reflecting our dedication to transparency and community collaboration.

 **We work together.**

The Smart Energy team's mission is to install & activate smart meters and maintain accurate device data for this crucial aspect of a future-proof, green UK energy solution. Our customers are both our end-users interacting with us via web and app, and our internal business users requiring access to data and troubleshooting smart meter issues. We're just finishing up a project to improve self-service journeys for customers to install smart meters, and we're about to dive into some integration and refactoring work to enable more automation and better efficiency for our users

 **In this role, you can expect to -**

  * Design, build, test and deploy Go event-driven microservices on Kubernetes in the context of the Identity and Access Management platform.
  * Contribute to the continuous improvement of our ways of working. Identify pain-points and propose improvements.
  * Own the whole software delivery process, from ideation through to in-life support and monitoring.

 **We deliver progress. What youâ€™ll do and how you will make an impact.**

We are seeking an individual with natural curiosity and an inherent drive to explore. You'll thrive in unfamiliar territories, unafraid to dive in and get hands-on. Your forte lies in envisioning the bigger picture, looking beyond immediate tasks to craft holistic solutions. A 'devops mindset' defines you, acknowledging your responsibility in not just writing code but also ensuring its smooth operation.

You'll be self aware and emotionally intelligent.
