Description

## Hi, weâ€™re Underdog!

Weâ€™re the fastest-growing sports gaming company _ever._

Our mission is to build innovative games and products for American sports fans.

Founded in 2020, our team built three of today's most widely played fantasy games and successfully launched the largest contest in the history of fantasy sports: a $15M NFL Best Ball tournament -- and thereâ€™s a lot more to come! Underdogâ€™s modern tech environment and in-house product development allow us to continuously deliver the best experiences for our users.

The opportunity in front of us to become the biggest company in our space is massive; after all, weâ€™re currently sitting in the fastest-growing consumer industry in the U.S. In just over two years, we reached a nearly $500 million valuation through some of the best investors in the game, including Mark Cuban, Kevin Durant, BlackRock, and SV Angel. We are many times larger now and our growth is not slowing down.

At Underdog, we believe that sports are for everyone and are building a tomorrow for every fan. Want to help create that future? Join us.
