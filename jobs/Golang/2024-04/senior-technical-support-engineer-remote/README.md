**üëã Reporting to** Jack Underwood, CEO and Co-founder

**üëØ Working in the** Engineering team (B2B and B2C)  
  

  
We are a **fully remote, bootstrapped, and profitable company** made up of experienced, talented people. We hire globally across time zones from UTC -5 to UTC +2 and currently have people based in Europe, South America, and Canada. We have a flexible, semi-asynchronous working culture with very few meetings.  
  

If you're pragmatic, like to get things done and enjoy the autonomy and responsibility that comes with working as an individual contributor - we think you'll be right at home here.  
  

# The job

This is the first position of its kind here at Circuit and, in typical start-up fashion, this is a broad role where you will tackle a whole range of technical problems. A mix of pre-sales and third-line tech support, you‚Äôll directly resolve ~50% of bugs that cross your desk and triage the rest, so you will need a lot of engineering experience, problem-solving skills, and customer support experience.  
  

As the first and only member of the tech support team, you will help shape the role _and_ the division. In the long term and as we grow the team, there are leadership opportunities for the right person.  
  

# **Want to know more?**

 **We are fully remote**

Our Co-founders are in different countries, and our team is spread across Europe, Brazil, and Canada. We don‚Äôt have a head office for you to visit, and we never will.  
  

**Flexible, asynchronous working**

Gives us task flexibility and work-life balance. Work around your life and at the times you do your best work.  
  

**We are bootstrapped‚Ä¶ and profitable**

Without outside investment, we are free to make our own decisions.  
  

**Equity options for everyone**

Work at Circuit for a minimum of one year, vests over 5 years.  
  

**Annual company performance bonus**

Paid in January and pro-rated to your start date in your joining year.  
  

**¬£3000 every three years for a new laptop**

You buy the laptop and claim back the cost - and it‚Äôs yours to keep.  
  

**¬£500 a year for new tech/home office**

Need a new desk, chair, keyboard, or headphones? Build a space to do your best work.  
  

**32 days of paid holiday per yea**

You can use it whenever you like. Four weeks in one go, one day off (almost) every other week, or anything in between.  
  

**Annual team meet-ups in 5-star locations**

We get together once a year as a team so that we can collaborate, get to know each other, and have fun!  
  

**Enhanced parental leave**

16 weeks on full pay and up to 52 weeks in total. Through birth or adoption, we want to make sure you have the time and resources to welcome your new addition.  
  

üí´There is so much more to tell you, but we can‚Äôt fit it all into one job advert! Check out our Public Handbook on our Careers Page to find out if we are right for you - getcircuit.com/jobs  
  

# Who we are, what we do, and how it's going

Back in 2017, we saw an issue with last-mile delivery - it was too complicated and stressful for drivers. Circuit started a mission to change that by choosing to develop an app that put the driver and their customers first.  
  

We were astounded by the response we received. Within our first year, we had almost 1,000 customers, $100k in ARR, and a team consisting of our two co-founders, Jack and Pol. Today, we now help more than 100,000 drivers deliver over 1bn packages worldwide (about 20 a second!), $20m ARR, and a lean team of ~40.  
  

# Your Skills and Experience

In short, we are looking for someone with experience in a similar role at a Senior+ level (possibly in a start-up where you covered a lot) or who has software engineering _and_ tech support experience.  
  

**Plus:**

  * Full-stack engineering/development experience, as well as technical support or sales support engineer experience (or a similar position)
  * On the frontend, JavaScript, TypeScript + React + NextJs, on the backend, all TypeScript
  * Great with customers and adept at explaining tech to non-technical folks
  * Problem-solving, reasoning, prioritizing, and independent decision-making skills
  * Spoken and written English to a high professional proficiency or native level

  
**A typical day...**

  * Solving a mix of medium and high-priority bugs, ~50% directly by contributing the fix yourself, ~25% by triaging to the appropriate team, and ~25% by realizing it‚Äôs user error and explaining the solution to them.
  * Join a customer call with our Senior Account Exec to provide technical guidance about how the implementation would go between our API and their CRM
  * A couple of async conversations with our customers who are in mid-implementation of our API and could use some guidance
  * Handle 10-15 technical support tickets, help users understand how to use our more complex functionality and how best to set up their teams
  * Make improvements to the documentation for the support team on how to handle repeat scenarios so that your future workload is reduced.

  

**What you won't be doing**

  * Daily stand-ups and fortnightly sprints. Expect ~one meeting per week. We‚Äôre not the right fit for you if you rely on regular meetings to keep on track
  * Sacrificing quality. We have high standards and won‚Äôt rush to meet an arbitrary deadline
  * Managing people. This will remain an individual contributor role, at least for now.
  * Working with junior folks. You need to be okay with doing more low-level and administrative tasks.

# Apply

If have the skills and experience we need and think Circuit sounds like the place for you, we would love you to apply. Thanks!
