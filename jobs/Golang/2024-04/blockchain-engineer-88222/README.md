### Quantstamp  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

Quantstamp is looking for a blockchain developer. As a blockchain developer, you will architect and prototype solutions to specific problems, and review implementations and existing solutions. Prototypes will be for a range of problems: they may consist of smart contracts, modifications to blockchain infrastructure, or tooling to automate the detection of particular concerns.

Your day-to-day work will involve developing software and designing systems in collaboration with researchers at Quantstamp. You may be working on problems that may never have been solved before, or you may be augmenting existing tools to add functionality. You may need to evaluate techniques and explore existing tools. Some projects and problems to solve will arise from clients, while others will be a result of community initiatives. You may be asked to compare and understand systems youâ€™re not familiar with, and you should be comfortable doing this. Ideally you have a strong ability to read and write code - the specific language is not too important, but both on-chain and off-chain coding experience is valuable. You may be asked to present your work internally.
