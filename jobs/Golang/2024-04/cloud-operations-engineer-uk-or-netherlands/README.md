### #the gist

We are looking for someone who is passionate about systems and operations engineering practices and methodologies to solve business requirements, constantly seeking new techniques, tools, and solutions to enhance our systems. As a startup in a fast-paced high growth environment, we are looking for an engineer that isn't bound by dogmatic principles assigned to traditional engineering roles.

#not awkward- just real  
Before we get started, let‚Äôs be specific here with minimum skillsets. This is a mid-level engineer position.
