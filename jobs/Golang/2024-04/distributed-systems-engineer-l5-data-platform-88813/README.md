Description

At Netflix, we want to entertain the world and are constantly innovating on how entertainment is imagined, created and delivered to a global audience. We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 220 million paid subscribers and are expanding into new forms of entertainment such as gaming.

  

The data infrastructure teams at Netflix enable us to leverage data to bring joy to our members in many different ways. We provide centralized data platforms and tools for various business functions at Netflix, so they can utilize our data to make critical data-driven decisions. We do all the heavy lifting to make it easy for our business partners to work with data efficiently, securely, and responsibly. We aspire to lead the industry standard in building a world-class data infrastructure, as Netflix leads the way to be the most popular and pervasive destination for global internet entertainment.

  

We are looking for distributed systems engineers to help evolve and innovate our infrastructure. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive team to bring new perspectives as we solve the next set of challenges. In addition, we are open to remote candidates. We value what you can do, from anywhere in the U.S.

  

  

**Spotlight on Data Infrastructure Teams:**

  

 **Database Access Platform** **|** Learn More

Our team champions advancements in data abstractions, building streamlined abstractions atop distributed data stores, like Apache Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Memcached, and S3. We cater to diverse Netflix use cases, including counters, flexible key-values, and time series. Beyond this, we're the custodians of Hollow, Netflix's robust memory co-located dataset library for efficient publishing and consumption. With Hollow, weâ€™re setting new standards in reducing the footprint of in-memory datasets while allowing rapid access to data, benefiting hundreds of Netflix applications across all business verticals. Our mandate is clear: empower Netflix's microservices to meet their increasing and dynamic data requirements.

  

Your Role:

Join us as a Senior Software Engineer on the Data Access Platform team. Your main task will be developing and advancing the open-source Hollow library and its use at Netflix via abstractions. Hollow is used broadly at Netflix in its mission to entertain the world! You'll collaborate closely with various teams, lead cross-functional projects, and share our experiences with the open-source community.

 **Data Platform Infrastructure** **|** Learn More

The Data Platform Infrastructure team acts as a platform for our own data platforms. Our shared infrastructure and tooling enable Netflix to quickly innovate on providing state-of-the-art data and analytics systems to the rest of the company without building bespoke scaffolding for each new system. To do this, we create high-leverage infrastructure, control, and deployment systems that are fine-tuned for the needs of running our data systems at scale; uniquely, many of our tools and systems are written in Python and Go, so this is a great team to consider if you enjoy working in a variety of languages.

  

Your Role:

As a Senior Software Engineer on the Data Infrastructure team, you will play an essential role in designing, developing, and maintaining our data infrastructure. Your work will help Netflix to innovate quickly by providing the company with state-of-the-art analytics platforms and data stores. You will help to provide the fundamental infrastructure that high-scale and high-critical datastore teams at Netflix (hosting 1000s of clusters of Cassandra, EVCache, Elasticsearch, and RDS) build their control planes on top of. You will work closely with various teams and lead cross-functional initiatives to ensure our infrastructure is efficient, scalable, and reliable.

  

  

  

### This would be your dream job if you enjoy:

  * Solving real business needs at large scale by applying your software engineering and analytical problem solving skills.
  * Architecting and building a robust, scalable, and highly available distributed infrastructure.
  * Leading cross-functional initiatives and collaborating with engineers, product managers, and TPM across teams.
  * Sharing our experiences with the open source communities and contributing to Netflix OSS. 

### About you:

  * 7+ years experience in crafting complex, scalable distributed data infrastructure
  * Proficiency in Java, C++, Golang, or Python with a solid understanding of multi-threading and memory management
  * Proven track record of developing and maintaining high-impact systems
  * Experience building and operating scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed systems
  * You have a BS in Computer Science or a related field
  * Familiarity with library development, DI frameworks (preferably SpringBoot), and container technologies
  * Previous exposure to in-memory dataset systems and Hollow experience is a plus for the Database Access team

A few more things about us:

  

As a team, we come from many different countries and our fields of education range from the humanities to engineering to computer science. Our team includes product managers, program managers, designers, full-stack developers, distributed systems engineers, and data scientists. Folks have the opportunity to wear different hats, should they choose to. We strongly believe this diversity has helped us build an inclusive and empathetic environment and look forward to adding your perspective to the mix!

  

At Netflix, we carefully consider a wide range of compensation factors to determine your personal top of market. We rely on market indicators to determine compensation and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to get it right. These considerations can cause your compensation to vary and will also be dependent on your location.

  

The overall market range for roles in this area of Netflix is typically $100,000 - $700,000

  

This market range is based on total compensation (vs. only base salary), which is in line with our compensation philosophy. Our culture is unique, and we tend to live by our values, so itâ€™s worth learning more about Netflix here.
