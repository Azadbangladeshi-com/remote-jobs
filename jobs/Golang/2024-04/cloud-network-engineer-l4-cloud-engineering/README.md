Description

Netflix is one of the world's leading streaming entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

  

Netflix has been on the leading edge of the cloud since beginning the migration to AWS 15 years ago and runs one of the largest Cloud footprints around. The Cloud Engineering organization exists to manage that massive scale, constantly innovating to increase fleet-wide agility, efficiency, and reliability of the Netflix cloud infrastructure, while solving scale problems that we are the first to ever hit. We build, operate, and maintain Compute, Network and Storage services so that developers at Netflix can rely on foundational building blocks when entertaining hundreds of millions of customers around the world. Join us as we push the boundaries of performance, efficiency, and resilience, empowering developers to create groundbreaking applications on a reliable platform.

  

Cloud Network Engineering owns all aspects of cloud-based networking for services at Netflix. Our goal is to create network architectures that can readily evolve to the needs of our product services and initiatives. We achieve this goal through the development of feature-rich tooling and services that improve network availability, security, and visibility while removing friction for our users.

  * Deep understanding of TCP/IP, Routing, IPv6, and IPv4.

  * Passion for technology, pragmatic thinking, and the ability to dive into ambiguous areas and break down complex problems.
  * Experience supporting core infrastructure services in an on-call rotation.

  * Balancing bias to action with the ability to make well-informed decisions.
  * Understanding and solving business needs at scale with high-quality solutions.

### Success criteria

  * You thrive in ambiguity; complex and fuzzy requirements are more common than clearly defined customer expectations.

  * You are independent and self-driven; progress is often self-directed by teams & individuals.
  * Youâ€™ve read about Netflixâ€™s culture and think you would thrive here.
