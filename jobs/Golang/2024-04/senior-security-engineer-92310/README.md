Description

SentiLink provides innovative identity and risk solutions, empowering institutions and individuals to transact confidently with one another.

By building the future of identity verification in the United States and reinventing the currently clunky, ineffective, and expensive process, we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.

Weâ€™ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. Weâ€™ve earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and have landed on the Forbes Fintech 50 in 2023 and 2024. Last but not least, weâ€™ve even been a part of history -- we were the first company to go live with the eCBSV and testified before the United States House of Representatives.
