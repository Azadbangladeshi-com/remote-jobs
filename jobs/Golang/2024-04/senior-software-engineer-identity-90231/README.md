Description

StrongDM lives by a very simple principle: **Put People First.**

  

That means we do the right things by our colleagues, employees and customers. It also means developing products and solutions that improve the lives of our customers. Our commitment to People First is one of the reasons our year-over-year customer retention rate is an industry-leading 98%. Once a customer, forever a fan. That's our goal.

  

When you work at StrongDM, you work with people who care, technology that works, and customers who are obsessed with both the product and the support they receive.

  

If you ask any employee of StrongDM, you‚Äôll find that our values truly are our guiding principles in everything we do‚Äìfrom how we make decisions to how we treat each other. That‚Äôs because these values represent the foundation for our culture and who we are as a company. It sounds cliche, we know. But trust us‚Äîwe‚Äôre onto something good. G2 can confirm. ‚úîÔ∏è

  

1\. We embrace the mission

2\. We pursue mastery

3\. We are people first

4\. We are smarter together

  

These are the values we seek to cultivate as an organization. They inform not just how we behave as individuals and teams, but also the unspoken traits of the candidates we hire and perspectives we take when helping and supporting customers. Speaking of candidates, we‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre here! If this sounds like an environment you‚Äôd thrive in, read on.
