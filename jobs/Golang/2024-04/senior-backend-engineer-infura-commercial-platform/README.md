Description

Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About Infura**

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

**What youâ€™ll do**

The commercial platform team builds tools and platforms for monetizing and commercializing APIs and other developer offerings. Our commercial platform allows our product teams to rapidly build out support for offering public access and provides our customers with tools to understand and control their usage of those products. You will be developing tools and services within Kubernetes that allow us to easily stand up, operate, and monetize APIs at scale.

**Would be great if you brought this to the role**

You have mastery over Golang or similar systems languages. You also have significant experience building with and operating service mesh / traffic routing proxies. You have solid experience with event-based systems and programming in cloud environments. You are knowledgeable about cloud based environments and understand things like object storage, databases (relational and NoSQL variants), and infrastructure management.

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. Weâ€™re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environmentâ€”apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.
