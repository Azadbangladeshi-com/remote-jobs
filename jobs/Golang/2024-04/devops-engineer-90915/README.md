Apply for this job

At Matter Labs, we believe freedom drives progress and prosperity. We donâ€™t see ourselves as a company, but as a team aligned around a single mission: to advance personal freedom for all (see ZK Credo).

  

To achieve this goal, weâ€™re building zkSync â€” a credibly neutral, fully open source technology stack and network on top of Ethereum, which is owned and governed by its community. We use advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum infinitely without compromising on security or decentralization. With a world-class team, a community of over 1M supporters across Twitter + Discord, and hundreds of millions $ in funding, we have abundant resources to accomplish the mission.

  

**The Role**

We are looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer/SRE to help improve the reliability, consistency, security, and performance of the zkSync infrastructure and apps. The role is instrumental in scaling and decentralizing zkSync as we will soon start working with external validators and guardians.

  

The ideal candidate will need to have a deep understanding of Kubernetes and experience operating services at scale. Some development experience is also desired in order to contribute to internal tools and help the rest of the engineering team develop, deploy and operate their services successfully.

#### Responsibilities:

    * Working as both an individual contributor and collaboratively to find new ways of improving the reliability, consistency, security, and performance of infrastructure and services
    * Build tools to support the operation, automation, and monitoring of high load apps
    * Write a framework and guidelines so external validators & guardians can get set up quickly and easily, and keep operating reliably
    * Draw on your knowledge of distributed systems to identify and fix the network, system, and service-level issues
    * Eliminate the manual TOIL that emerges with large, distributed systems. Identify it, own it, and automate it (where possible). Infra and services should ideally automatically heal or failover.
    * Work with engineering teams in designing and developing systems that are resilient, secure, and highly performant
    * Provide support for the operation teams 24/7 â€” on-call in off-work hours only for critical issues (escalations)

#### Your profile:

    * You are driven by passion, curiosity, and desire to make a meaningful contribution to the world
    * Senior-level experience in Software Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering, or a dev-focused DevOps role
    * Expert level scripting/coding skills in one or more languages (TypeScript/Golang/Rust)
    * Experience with IaC tools (Pulumi/Terraform/Crossplane)
    * Experience with configuration management tools (Helm/Kapitan/Ansible)
    * Experience with observability systems (Prometheus/Grafana/ELK/Jaeger)
    * Deep knowledge of Kubernetes, Linux, and GCP/AWS
    * Strong analytical and logical skills
    * Strong security mindset
    * Experience with high-load projects is a big plus
    * Ownership mindset and a track record of successfully accomplished projects
    * Ability to simply articulate the "why" behind best practices and to build positive and collaborative relationships with colleagues across teams and geographies

  

  

**Working at Matter Labs**

  

At Matter Labs, you have the freedom to work how you want, when you want, and from where you want. All positions are 100% remote (with optional travel to team and/or industry events).
