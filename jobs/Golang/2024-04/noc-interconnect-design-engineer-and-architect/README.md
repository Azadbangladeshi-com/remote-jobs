##  **Job Area:**

Engineering Group, Engineering Group > ASICS Engineering

 _ **General Summary:**_

As a leading technology innovator, Qualcomm pushes the boundaries of what's possible to enable next-generation experiences and drives communication and data processing transformation to help create a smarter, connected future for all.

The NoC bus team group consists of a multi-disciplinary group involved from early product specification and analysis effort to final RTL delivery to the SoCs. One aspect of the process is to identify architecture bottlenecks and drive micro-architecture choices using performance and power analysis, and to provide the SoC team with design guidelines for bus protocol compliance and best power interconnect.

Candidates should have strong knowledge of bus protocols, synthesis tools, process nodes, VLSI design, and successful industry experience with deployment of IPs in large SoC projects while working in a collaborative environment.

**Responsibilities:**

The successful applicant will be responsible for creating micro-architecture bus components specifications as well as analyzing the performance results, deliver RTL and run tool flows. Responsibilities also include evaluating new IPs, driving new protocol deployments as well as defining system wide guidelines for IPs to inter-operate together in the SoC. Candidate should also be able to deliver RTL to the SoC team, support verification and silicon validation teams, and work with SW teams to support successful deployments of the interconnects.

 **Skills/Experience:**

  * Knowledge of various bus protocols (AHB, AXI, CHI, â€¦), network on chip. 
  * Familiarity with ARM GIC architecture and interrupt routing mechanisms.
  * Strong working knowledge of architecture tradeoff analysis and performance trouble shooting.
  * Strong knowledge of ASIC flow (synthesis, STA, Lint), power tools.
  * Ability to define bus components micro-architecture while taking into account performance/power/area tradeoff.
  * Ability to quickly react and adapt to changes.
  * Excellent communication skills.
  * Familiarity with CPU architecture is a big plus.
