## **What You'll Do**

As an Engineer, you will be responsible for designing, developing and operating significant areas of our routing services. In this role, you can expect to:

  * Solve complex guidance scenarios that donâ€™t have good solutions today
  * Develop best-in-class guidance experiences that make routing enjoyable, not robotic
  * Provide highly customizable guidance solutions for large OEMs as well as very niche customers with unique use cases
  * Build the tools others will use to unlock incredible mapping and navigation solutions never seen before

## **What We Believe are Important Traits for This Role**

  * Experience engineering modern C++ and Linux server applications in a commercial or open-source development environment, or equivalent performance-critical systems experience with Go, Rust, or the JVM.
  * Knowledge of operating systems and distributed systems (e.g., fault-tolerance, consistency, service discovery, etc.)
  * A rigorous approach to problem solving, using experiments and data analysis to drive quality of service improvements
  * Willingness to go beyond your comfort zone and develop new skills across the full range of our stack
  * Located in the Eastern Time Zone

## **What We Value**

In addition to our core values, which are not unique to this position and are necessary for Mapbox leaders:

  * We value high-performing creative individuals who dig into problems and opportunities.
  * We believe in individuals being their whole selves at work. We commit to this through supportive health care, parental leave, flexibility for the things that come up in life, and innovating on how we think about supporting our people.
  * We emphasize an environment of teaching and learning to equip employees with the tools needed to be successful in their function and the company.
  * We strongly believe in the value of growing a diverse team and encourage people of all backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, abilities, and sexual orientations to apply.

Our annual base compensation for this role ranges from $143,000 - $213,325 for most US locations and 5% to 10% higher for US locations with a higher cost of labor. Job level and actual compensation will be decided based on factors including, but not limited to, individual qualifications objectively assessed during the interview process (including skills and prior relevant experience, potential impact, and scope of role), market demands, and specific work location. Please discuss your specific work location with your recruiter for more information.
