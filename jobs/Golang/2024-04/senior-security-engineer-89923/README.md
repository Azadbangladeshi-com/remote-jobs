Striveworks is a cutting-edge software startup that provides companies with tools to build and support machine learning models at scale. Our team is composed of experts in machine learning, software development, and cloud as well as on-prem infrastructure. We are committed to helping both government and commercial organizations harness the power of AI.

We are seeking an experienced Senior Security Engineer to ensure we provide customers with best-in-class security protection. As a Security Engineer, you will be responsible for identifying and mitigating security risks, as well as implementing and maintaining security tools and processes.

    * Black/Grey/White box penetration testing
    * Vulnerability scanning
    * Static/Dynamic Code Analysis
    * Review pull-requests/merge-requests (as requested and/or time permitting)
  * Submit tickets and automate tests for individual issues, and assist in prioritization
  * Mitigate security risks in a variety of ways, including:
    * Security evangelization, based on known threat profiles, industry best-practices, etc.
    * Assisting developers with, for example, static code analysis hits by elaborating on the reason the code failed the test, along with suggestions on how to accomplish functionality goals without failing that test. (PR/MR reviews and/or Pair programming)
    * Targeted training
    * Automated tests in the DevSecOps pipeline
  * Automate the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of security tools, such as log aggregators, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems
  * Develop and maintain security policies, procedures, and standards to ensure compliance with industry best practices and regulatory requirements
  * Conduct Information Security training for employees and provide guidance on security best practices
  * Configure and respond to security alerts and incidents.

The anticipated base pay range for this position is $175,000â€“$220,000/year. Striveworksâ€™ total compensation package includes a competitive base salary, annual performance-based equity grants, and a lucrative yearly cash bonus.

###  **The Right Fit**

We spend a lot of time during our hiring process talking about shared values.

**Why?** We passionately believe that fostering an environment where people can self-actualize and pursue greatness is the best way to achieve our individual and collective goals.

**What does this mean for you?** We want to provide you with the conditions to thrive in an environment where you can achieve your goals, where you know the team shares your goals, and where you make and accept decisions for the team with humility. At Striveworks, we want your say/do ratio to be 1 and to know that being part of a top-tier team means that there is no smartest person in the room. If that makes sense, weâ€™re already on the same page.

###  **Build, Deploy, and Maintain AI for an Unpredictable World**

AI is driving a new Industrial Revolution. But most AI tools only work when the world looks the same tomorrow as it did yesterday. That's rarely the case.  
Striveworks was formed to fix this problem. Our platform lets teams build AI models, deploy them into unpredictable environments, and watch them deliver trustworthy resultsâ€”day after day. Our approach has transformed AI outcomes for organizations where failure is never an option. As a result, Striveworks was recognized as an exemplar in the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence Final Report.

In 2023, Striveworks placed on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 as one of the most rapidly growing technology companies in North America. In 2024, Striveworks was honored with a Built In Best Places to Work awardâ€”for the third year running.
