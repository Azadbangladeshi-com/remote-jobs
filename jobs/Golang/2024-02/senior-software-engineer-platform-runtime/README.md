### **SeatGeek believes live events are powerful experiences that unite humans. With our technological savvy and fan-first attitude weâ€™re simplifying and modernizing the ticketing industry.**

We are looking for a Software Engineer (open to varying levels of experience) to join SeatGeekâ€™s Platform Runtime team. As a Software Engineer, you'll build and improve high quality, opinionated and standardized libraries and SDKs that power the entirety of SeatGeek's technology ecosystem. As a member of the Platform Runtime team, you will be involved in themes such as building standardized libraries and SDKs for a variety of frameworks, developing an opinionated feature flag and configuration management solution, and ensuring our applications run performantly and reliably.

SeatGeek has more services and deployments than developers, which means automation has to be the norm. The Platform Runtime team is the backbone that supports SeatGeekâ€™s Enterprise and Consumer lines of business making software easier, safer, and more consistent as we continue to grow our primary and secondary ticketing platform and support clients such as the Dallas Cowboys, and Manchester City FC.

### **What you'll do**

  * Develop and refine software and standard libraries that power applications across SeatGeekâ€™s entire stack
  * Build opinionated solutions to help manage and enhance the software application deployment process
  * Build and maintain tools that our developers use to observe their applications, and drive initiatives to increase our overall reliability
  * Be involved in the full lifecycle of software development from project proposal and planning to implementation and maintenance
  * Collaborate with other departments on how to run production systems and deployments with autonomy
  * Support teams with expertise in the areas of deployment, configuration, routing, monitoring and scalability in all parts of the stack
  * Participate in an on-call schedule

### **Who you are**

You love building resilient infrastructure but have an even greater love for how itâ€™s deployed and managed. You make decisions based on data and are not afraid of experimenting to get the information you need.

  * Passion for craftsmanship and product. You have well-considered opinions about how reliable infrastructure should work, and hold yourself and your code to a high standard
  * Experience working with cloud providers
  * Experience with VMs, containers, and serverless compute platforms
  * Experience with service discovery and routing between microservices
  * Experience coding in an interpreted language (application development and/or Go experience is a plus)
  * Experience with the full software development lifecycle
  * Familiarity with Relational and Non-relational databases
  * Experience with Configuration Management systems and Infrastructure as Code
  * Experience with continuous integration, delivery, testing, and code deployment 
  * Experience using observability tools to make performance improvements and forecast growth
  * Experience improving system architecture, diagnosing shortcomings and implementing evidence-based recommendations 
  * You can simplify complex topics to better suit a non-technical audience 
  * Commitment to your teammates. You enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different experiences and take pride in mentoring and learning from others
