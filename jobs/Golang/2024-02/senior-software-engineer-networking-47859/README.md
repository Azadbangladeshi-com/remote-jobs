#### About the department

Cloudflare operates a large global network spanning hundreds of cities (data centers). You will join a team of talented network engineers who are building software solutions to improve network resilience and reduce operational toil.

#### What you'll do

As a member of the Network Operating System (NetOS) team you will be a key technical contributor to a cutting-edge network software infrastructure which is used to drive layer2 and layer3 devices on Cloudflare's network.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

 **Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
