**About Us**

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the worldâ€™s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweekâ€™s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

  

**The Engineering Team**

At Chainlink Labs, our engineering team pushes the scale and capabilities of decentralized applications across the industry. The Chainlink Network holds >70% market share in the oracle space, solving real-world problems by enabling smart contracts to securely interact with off-chain data/computation.

  

We value talented and driven craftsmen who work collaboratively to tackle complex challenges, deliver product impact, and grow as builders. Join us and shape the future of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

  

**About The Role**

As a software engineer working on Chainlink, youâ€™ll collaborate with an experienced technical team of other senior engineers, distributed systems computing experts, and security experts, who are all committed to building world-changing decentralized infrastructure. Youâ€™ll develop and build highly scalable, secure, and reliable software that will change the way smart contracts function at a fundamental level. As an engineer working on CCIP, you will help build an open-sourced standard for developers to quickly build secure cross-chain services and applications. With a universal messaging interface, smart contracts can communicate across multiple blockchain networks, eliminating the need for developers to write custom code for building chain-specific integrations. CCIP opens up a new category of Web3.0 applications that can be built by developers for a multi-chain ecosystem.

    * Build automation to manage and deploy smart contracts and other required tooling to manage the production releases
    * Build Network Health Monitoring ie, funnel data to Observability, collect valuable metrics, and set up alerts/dashboards

#### Requirements:

    * Proficiency in programming languages such as Rust and Go.
    * Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, with the ability to design and develop efficient blockchain solutions.
    * The ideal candidate has a background in public blockchains or distributed systems

#### Preferred Requirements:

    * Experience with test-driven development and the use of testing frameworks
    * Experience developing complex web applications/services and backend APIs
    * Experience with distributed systems and/or container orchestration
    * Hands-on experience with blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Cosmos, Bitcoin, or Solana.
    * Hands-on experience with L2 platforms such as Polygon ZKEvm, ZKSync Era, Linea, Taiko, Scroll, etc.
