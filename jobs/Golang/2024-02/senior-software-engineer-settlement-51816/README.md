### About Paxos

Todayâ€™s financial infrastructure is archaic, expensive, inefficient and risky â€” supporting a system that leaves out more people than it lets in. So weâ€™re rebuilding it.

Weâ€™re on a mission to open the worldâ€™s financial system to everyone by enabling the instant movement of any asset, any time, in a trustworthy way. For over a decade, weâ€™ve built blockchain infrastructure that tokenizes, custodies, trades and settles assets for the worldâ€™s leading financial institutions, like PayPal, Venmo, Mastercard and Interactive Brokers.

To this end, we're building the necessary infrastructure to support the shift towards safer and more efficient global markets that can operate 24/7. We take pride in our commitment to continuous innovation, high performance, effective mentoring/coaching, multi-disciplinary collaboration and the authentic application of lean/agile methods.
