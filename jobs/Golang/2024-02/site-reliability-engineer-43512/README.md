### **Description**

 **What you'll be doing...**

The Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) position operates within the Technology &amp Engineering department at Future. We provide the global digital infrastructure and support required to deliver a multitude of high traffic brand websites, ecommerce/content analysis systems, back-office services and advertising services. The Engineering team has recently become globally distributed and is providing new challenges and opportunities to our operating model. We frequently participate in hack-days, local meetups and larger conferences to ensure our skills are kept sharp and to work with different members of the team.

As one of Futureâ€™s SRE's, youâ€™ll be coordinating a globally distributed team to achieve highly resilient, cost effective, distributed service environments. You will be collaborating with our software development teams, key project stakeholders and vendors to ensure our technical delivery aligns with the business strategy.

You will ensure that all our services meet their availability objectives, and collaborate with the technology teams to build highly resilient services and workflows. An SRE role is similar to a DevOps Engineer role and emphasises our objective to maintain a robust and performant organisation from all aspects of its technical process from CI/CD patterns to routing traffic around failing regions.

This is a challenging role! You will be supporting our colleagues, ensuring services achieve their service level objectives (SLOs) whilst keeping pace with industry trends and acting as a spokesperson for their best practice and adoption. Some of your time will be spent on routine â€˜Opsâ€™ work such as managing on-call incidents, patching and security checks. When not working on operations tasks you will be working with the Technology teams to improve our service to meet SLO, improve service operability and delivering their product objectives.

 **Experience that will put you ahead of the curve...**

To succeed in this role you will be a proficient software developer, with experience in networking, storage, containerisation, and Linux operating systems. This is a complex and ever-changing business so you will need to be able to attend to unfamiliar situations, logically identifying the key aspects to focus upon before working empirically to meet the objectives at hand.

Futureâ€™s operating infrastructure is very broad, requiring an equally broad set of skills to support. As part of the SRE team you are not expected to be an expert in all fields, but to recognise your own strengths and support the group.

Example of principal systems we desire awareness of includes

  * Containerisation and orchestration, eg Kubernetes
  * Infrastructure as Code tools such as Terraform, Cloudformation
  * Development languages such as Python, Ruby or Golang
  * Data storage systems including MySQL, MongoDB, Riak, Solr, S3

**What's in it for youâ€¦**

We have a number of awesome perks available to our staff. We offer huge opportunities to learn and develop, whether through professional qualifications, exposure to incredible business projects or informal lunch &amp learns, hosted by your colleagues. We have a fantastic culture where we really do care about our people and want everyone to succeed. Varied roles mean youâ€™re not pigeonholed in to one finite area but get the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills and experience

Internal job family level T6

The expected range for this role is 72,000CZK - 135,000CZK per month
