We are looking for an Atlanta-based, talented, and high-energy member to join our Traveling Media Team in 2024!

Expect to be our company‚Äôs primary ‚Äúboots on the ground‚Äù in the creation of impactful visual content for apartment community websites and marketing campaigns. As a one of our Seasonal Media Producers, you‚Äôll travel +80% of each month, traveling around the country to produce exceptional photographs and walk-through video tours of unique apartment communities and floor plans, while providing remarkable interactions with on-site staff and residents.

Onboarding and training for this position will take place at our office in Lincoln, NE and will last approximately 2 weeks. Once you're geared up and ready to go, you'll hit the road for an awesome seasonal experience. The start date for this position is as early as **April 22, 2024** and and the season will end on **August 31, 2024**.

### Are a collaborator.

  * Be an integral part of our creative team, which requires a range of talents to deliver our final product with high quality and timeliness.

### Can adapt to change.

  * We need team members who adapt to change, are excited by new challenges, and are strong decision-makers while on the road. If there are ever two things that can change by the minute, it‚Äôs travel and technology!

### Are consistent and persistent.

  * Produce and return large quantities of impactful visual content in a timely manner that are continually adherent to our brand standards.

### Want to be an adventurer.

  * This job will require 15+ days of travel per month, so be prepared to find yourself exploring many new cities and racking up Southwest Rewards Points!

Experience in all of these platforms isn't a requirement, but you need to be somewhat tech savvy and able to learn quickly. If you have a hard time connecting to a new wifi network, this probably won't be a great fit.

### More about RentVision:

RentVision was founded in 2009, after our Founder and CEO, David Watson, spent multiple weekends hunting for an apartment. After weeks of searching, he signed a lease on a unit he‚Äôd never seen. Frustrated by this experience, David believed there had to be a better, easier way to confidently rent an apartment. This sparked the idea for a new innovation‚Äîthe industry's first Walkthrough Video Tour. RentVision has been innovating, developing, and growing ever since.

Today, we create software platforms, build websites, offer strategic advising, deliver media solutions, and travel the country sharing industry knowledge. We are part tech company and part full-service organization, combining the best of both worlds: excellent software solutions with remarkable client service.

 **Our Purpose:** To consider others as more important than ourselves.

 **Our Mission:** To make renting apartments easy.

 **Our Vision for Our Clients:** To deliver a predictive leasing platform that optimizes marketing and revenue management.

 **Our Vision for Prospective Residents:** To help people rent an apartment without needing to drive anywhere.

### Our Core Values:

  * Be Remarkable - We use our intelligence, personality, and unique skills to deliver amazing results.
  * Systemize Excellence - We build and do what is excellent, efficient, and repeatable.
  * Considerate Candor - We seek and give direct feedback that is thoughtful and productive.
