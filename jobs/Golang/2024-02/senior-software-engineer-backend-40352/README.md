### Job Description

Bitkey sits within the Proto team. Proto's purpose is to accelerate the worldâ€™s transition to a more open economy by making products that increase access and independence for everyone. The first two initiatives weâ€™ve identified that represent the biggest impact to this purpose are in the Bitcoin space with Bitcoin mining and Bitkey, a self custody Bitcoin wallet. While weâ€™re starting there, we donâ€™t believe the need for tools to increase oneâ€™s independence is limited to bitcoin or the financial space. One principle across everything we do in Proto is open development â€“ show and tell. We develop products in the open, you can read more about them at bitkey.build and mining.build.

Bitkey is looking for a backend engineer to build the software customers use to interact with our bitcoin wallet.

You Will:

  * Ship a non-custodial, hardware-enabled bitcoin wallet to a global audience
  * Design, build, deploy, and sustain a wide range of backend secure and reliable services supporting the wallet -- multisig key management and provisioning, blockchain interaction, recovery processes, logistics, and more
  * Make key architecture and platform choices, leveraging existing Square infrastructure and best practices where appropriate and and forging a new path when our unique needs require it
  * Collaborate with mobile and firmware engineers, product managers, and infrastructure and service teams throughout the company
  * Own testing, observability, and maintenance for the services you and the team create

### Qualifications

You Have:

  * 6+ years experience with the full life-cycle of critical production services - ideally in one of java/go/ruby and on AWS
  * Experience developing for bitcoin/cryptocurrency applications, or with key management and other cryptographic applications. _Note: with this role, we are hiring for multiple positions - and not all of the initial team needs to have this prerequisite_
  * Empathy for your customers and colleagues
  * Interest in the opportunities and challenges that come with building a new product area from the ground up
  * No location requirements, occasional travel to U.S. and international manufacturing sites may be required. GMT-5 (Eastern) to GMT-10 (Hawaii) strongly preferred for engineering roles.
