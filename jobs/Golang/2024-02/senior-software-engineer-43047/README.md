# [Senior Software Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-43047)  
### SailPoint  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ Remote,India`  

You are an amazing software engineer, a canny technical leader, and a shrewd software architect. You know not only how to write scalable SaaS services from the ground up using proven technologies, but you have been around the block many times with several teams, and you can see the traps laid before engineers trying to build a new system. You love to coach those engineers, to guide them into becoming thoughtful, self-starting contributors who have a bigger and bigger impact on the organization. You think that _carefully deciding not to write code_ is an effective use of your time, and you love nothing more than deleting code.

At SailPoint, we are building the most comprehensive suite of identity governance & management SaaS products in the world. Built from the ground up on a microservices, multi-tenant architecture, we enable customers to connect all of their relevant business applications, and then provide them the tools to effectively manage and govern those identities and access controls.

In this role, you will spend much of your time understanding business problems and shared engineering desires across teams to collaborate, debate, design, prototype and implement software. Your ability to build trusting relationships through use of your expertise and careful listening to stakeholders and your team will be paramount to success in this role. You will also lead feature development within the team, writing exemplary code, consistently setting the bar for code reviews and technical advice on your team.

### Responsibilities

  * Seek to deeply understand business problems or common engineering challenges and propose software architecture designs to solve them elegantly by abstracting useful common patterns.

  * Proactively collaborate on, discuss, debate and refine ideas, problem statements, and software designs with different (sometimes _many_ ) stakeholders, architects and members of your team.

  * Take a committed approach to prototyping and co-implementing systems alongside less experienced engineers on your teamâ€”thereâ€™s no room for ivory towers here.

  * Share support of critical team systems by participating in on-call rotations, learning the characteristics of currently running systems, and participating in improvements.

  * Occasionally serve as a debugging and implementation expert during escalations of systems issues that have evaded the ability of less experienced engineers to solve in a timely manner.

  * Collaborates with Product Management and Engineering Manager to produce a prioritized team roadmap

### Requirements

  * Deep implementation experience in GoLang for at least 2+ years, and 5+ years of experience with Java/GoLang required.

  * A positive and collaborative demeanor, combined with a love for teaching

  * 7+ years of overall professional software development experience

  * 3+ years of experience leading systems design

  * 2+ years of professional experience in a multiple-stakeholder environment

  * A proven ability to change your own opinions and preferred methods based on new evidence

  * Truly excellent written & verbal communication skills, including the art of being concise
