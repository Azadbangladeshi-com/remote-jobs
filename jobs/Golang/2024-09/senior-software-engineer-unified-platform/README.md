**DRW** is a diversified trading firm with over 3 decades of experience bringing sophisticated technology and exceptional people together to operate in markets around the world. We value autonomy and the ability to quickly pivot to capture opportunities, so we operate using our own capital and trading at our own risk.

Headquartered in Chicago with offices throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia, we trade a variety of asset classes including Fixed Income, ETFs, Equities, FX, Commodities and Energy across all major global markets. We have also leveraged our expertise and technology to expand into three non-traditional strategies: real estate, venture capital and cryptoassets.

We operate with respect, curiosity and open minds. The people who thrive here share our belief that itâ€™s not just what we do that mattersâ€“it's how we do it. DRW is a place of high expectations, integrity, innovation and a willingness to challenge consensus.

UP (Unified Platform) consolidates data and technologies into a comprehensive solution, accelerating time to market. Optimizing decision-making and research, our platform simplifies implementing new ideas, enhancing our competitive edge. We work from high-level requirements where programmers are expected to gain an intimate understanding of the business. We strive for an environment where developers have the autonomy to pursue business solutions without arbitrary management constraints. We are a group of polyglots and technologists always seeking to find the right tool for each problem. Broadly, the development teams at DRW believe in rapid deployment and feedback, automated testing, and cohesive, transparent, lightly-coupled service architectures.

UP teams are segmented into multiple areas including:

**Platform Engineering -** Teams within platform engineering provide cross-cutting capabilities that enable other teams to focus on domain- or business-specific needs by streamlining and standardizing technical approaches. For example, one of these teams provides data mapping tools, access management, and usage tracking capabilities for development teams.

**Domain Engineering -** Teams within domain engineering own critical capabilities that extend beyond a single desk or business area, building services and data solutions to optimize for a broad array of use cases. For example, these teams work on problems like managing and enhancing DRWâ€™s instrument and organizational reference data models for seamless interoperability across the firm; handling real-time message flow and integrations with third-party trades and orders feeds; or providing trading desks and business units with current, historical, and real-time streaming portfolio views.
