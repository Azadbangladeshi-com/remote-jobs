**Bonus Points:**

  * Full-stack development experience, including backend (Python/Django, Java/Kotlin) and frontend (React, Node.js) technologies.
  * Experience with message queues (Kafka, Kinesis, Redis Streams) and event-driven or reactive programming.
  * Familiarity with design systems, state management, and mobile app management through platforms like Appleâ€™s developer portal and App Store Connect.
  * Passion for data-driven design, asynchronous programming, and creating exceptional user experiences.
  * Love of dogs (and bunnies) or just toleranceâ€”our workplace is very canine-friendly.

**Qualifications:**

  * Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent experience. 
  * Proven experience leading software development across any of the four disciplines (iOS, Android, Backend, or Frontend).
