###  **About the role**

### #ubiquitous intro

Do you enjoy working collaboratively to build tools that empower engineers to create exceptional products? Do you enjoy empowering engineers to build at scale? Are you energized by the challenge of designing and optimizing an internal developer platform that unlocks innovation?

We seek a skilled and motivated Platform Engineer who will develop and maintain our Internal Development Platform (IDP) and related tooling, relentlessly focused on making the software development process quick and painless.

### #the gist

You will be dedicated to improving the developer experience, supporting developers and site reliability engineers in their efforts to deploy solutions quickly and efficiently with reduced cognitive load. At your disposal will be tools, automation, workflows, and your own skills to reduce repetitive development tasks, increase productivity, abstract configurations, streamline testing, and simplify pipelines.
