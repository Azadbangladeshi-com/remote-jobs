### Expel  
#### `üí∞ ~236k` `üåé Remote`  

Description

Your passion for uptime was forged deep within Fires of Production and tempered on the Great Anvil of Incident Response. You‚Äôre an Expel Principal Site Reliability Engineer - a protector, champion, and leader of Expel's reputation for service reliability. Expel‚Äôs mission is to stop evil hackers, and since hackers don‚Äôt take downtime, neither can Expel.

Innovation comes naturally to you, but you're also eager to help others. You understand that operational reliability is a shared mission across all of engineering, and that your role is to make it as easy as possible for Expel to achieve that mission. You spend your mornings collaborating with architects and product stakeholders to outline the next quarter‚Äôs reliability initiatives, then the afternoon pair-programming with a junior SRE to mentor them in debugging a tricky Kubernetes deployment.

You use your passion for reliability and connection with the broader SRE community to ensure Expel is sticking to best reliability practices within the cloud native ecosystem.

You take pride in all the nines of uptime you‚Äôve achieved, but you know that an SRE‚Äôs job is never done!

## **What Expel can do for you**

  * Provide an opportunity to grow and maintain reliability-focused platform features within a cloud native engineering platform using cutting-edge infrastructure and tooling (Kubernetes/GKE runtime, Hashicorp toolset, etc)
  * Provide you a mission you can get behind: stopping evil hackers so our customers can focus on their business and leave their cybersecurity to us
  * Be included in a company focused on creating opportunities to do interesting work and creating space for employees to learn and grow
  * An opportunity to contribute to a best-in-class product
  * A leadership team that‚Äôs embraced modern Site Reliability principles, as outlined by Google and other industry leaders.

* * *

## **What you can do for Expel**

  * Lead project work to build and maintain platform features that cut across the Expel product‚Äôs reliability, networking, and cloud infrastructure.
  * Contribute by pushing IaC commits daily, with occasional opportunities to write and test application code in Python, Golang, and Javascript
  * Mentor and motivate service owners on how to use the platform in order to deploy, measure, monitor, and operate their own services at scale.
  * Participate in a weekly support rotation that includes taking the on-call pager and providing nearly on-demand working-hours support to platform users.
  * Lead incident response, triage, and root cause analysis support
  * Poke fun at our leadership team in creative ways.

* * *

## **What you should bring with you**

  * A passion for learning and improving your work product
  * Significant experience operating Kubernetes within highly distributed environments
  * Experience running systems in GCP or AWS
  * Exposure to monitoring and observability infrastructure and standard methodologies
  * An understanding of infrastructure-as-code practices, tools, and patterns
  * Some experience developing software in Linux environments, preferably with Python and/or Golang
  * A customer-minded approach that enables the success of platform users as well as building trust across the organization.
  * A collaborative disposition that allows you to work optimally on and across teams
  * Four years of systems experience either in operations or development
  * Missing some items on the list? That's ok! We still want to talk to you!

* * *

## **How our team works together**

We build and run teams where everyone is pulling in the same direction and is learning from each other:

  * We work out of a shared backlog
  * We pair program weekly, as it makes sense
  * We peer-review everything
  * We do weekly blame-free retros to reinforce what‚Äôs going well, so we do more of it, and surface what‚Äôs not going well, so we can do something about it. Same thing for projects and significant operational problems.

* * *
