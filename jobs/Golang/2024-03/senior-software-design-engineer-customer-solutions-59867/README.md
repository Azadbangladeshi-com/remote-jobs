Weâ€™re looking for a software engineer who can work collaboratively on a fast-paced team, wants to own their projects end to end, and can find creative solutions to solve hard customer problems.

In this role youâ€™ll work closely with Mattermostâ€™s top customers to design, build and ship bespoke features and integrations that help them get the most out of Mattermost. This involves understanding their requirements, rapidly iterating to develop solutions, and deploy them much quicker than traditional product development lifecycles.

You will be instrumental in identifying opportunities to improve deployment processes and contributing to the development of best practices.

Through this work youâ€™ll be directly supporting leaders in the tech, space, financial, federal and other industries.

Do you want to build fast? Do you want to see the direct impact of your work? Do you hunger for hard problems to solve? Do you want to contribute to one of the largest Go and React open source projects? Join our team.

  * Deep understanding of infrastructure and networking concepts, with the ability to design and trouble-shoot complex deployments.
