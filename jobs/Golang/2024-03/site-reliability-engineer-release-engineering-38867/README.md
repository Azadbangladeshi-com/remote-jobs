**About Us**

Chainlink Labs is the primary contributing developer of Chainlink, the decentralized computing platform powering the verifiable web. Chainlink is the industry-standard platform for providing access to real-world data, offchain computation, and secure cross-chain interoperability across any blockchain. Chainlink Labs helps power verifiable applications for banking, DeFi, global trade, and gaming by collaborating with some of the worldâ€™s largest financial institutions, notably Swift, DTCC, and ANZ. Chainlink Labs also works with top Web3 teams, including Aave, Compound, GMX, Maker, and Synthetix. Chainlink Labs was ranked in Newsweekâ€™s 100 Most Loved Workplaces 2023 in both the United States and United Kingdom.

  

**The Engineering Team**

At Chainlink Labs, our engineering team pushes the scale and capabilities of decentralized applications across the industry. The Chainlink Network holds >70% market share in the oracle space, solving real-world problems by enabling smart contracts to securely interact with off-chain data/computation.

  

We value talented and driven craftsmen who work collaboratively to tackle complex challenges, deliver product impact, and grow as builders. Join us and shape the future of blockchain technology and decentralized finance.

  

All roles with Chainlink Labs are globally remote based. We encourage you to apply regardless of your location.

  

The Infrastructure Platform team enables Chainlink development and empowers engineers to continue building and supporting crucial products and services that have a profound impact in the blockchain industry. Recently, Chainlink crossed $7 trillion TVE (total value enabled) as an undisputed leader in the oracle space. Reliability is vital to the success of our company. As a staff SRE, you will help us accelerate and enable other engineering teams by increasing self-service and decreasing cognitive load. Key initiatives surrounding our mission include architecting and building a services catalog and an internal developer platform.

  

This job would be perfect for someone who has a strong DevOps mentality, is passionate about building and maintaining a mature GitOps environment, and has experience building and growing an internal developer platform. The entire engineering team is expanding, and you would have plenty of opportunities to build, learn, and grow.

  

We are distributed across time zones and continents, and we embrace remote work. Our on-call rotation uses the follow-the-sun pattern: you will be on-call some of the time, but your shifts will be during your day and our team is large.

  

We all have different backgrounds and are determined to help you succeed no matter where you are or who you are. If you think you would do a great job at Chainlink, we are looking forward to speaking with you, even if you don't match 100% of the job requirements: those describe people we've usually had a great time working with, but they're not a tick-box exercise.
