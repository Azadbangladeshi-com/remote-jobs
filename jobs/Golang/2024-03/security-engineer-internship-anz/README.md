 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Weâ€™re looking for the next generation of Canvanauts!

Our Canva internship is a 12-week remote friendly program that runs from the first week of December to the last week of February. There will also be an opportunity to meet your team in person at our flagship campus in Sydney to experience all the magic of Canva in real life. So your summer time is sorted.

As an Intern, you'll have the opportunity to work on real-life projects from start to finish. Along with this, we'll pair you with a Host and assign you a Buddy who will ensure your success every step of the intern journey. Think of them as your own personal intern tour guides.

Youâ€™ll be part of a welcoming and inclusive Early Talent community of peers that take pride in Canvaâ€™s culture of being good humans and empowering each other to achieve our big goals.

  
**Where and how you can work**

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. If you call New Zealand home, we have our Auckland co-working space too.

But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

 **What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

We need to be able to ship robust and secure features without sacrificing speed and scale of delivery, which is where our Security Engineers come in.

Incoming interns will work and learn alongside an experienced group of blue-team Security Engineers in a fast-moving cloud-first technology environment. They will be exposed to a wide range of functions within the diverse Security group and gain experience in both operations and engineering capacities and work towards making Canva more secure.

  * Learning tools, libraries and services that support Canva engineers in building secure software.
  * Identifying security controls in Canvaâ€™s compute, platform engineering, and cloud infrastructure disciplines.
  * Learning new and emerging security technologies that make it easier to reliably maintain platform and infrastructure security.
  * Discovery and triage of vulnerabilities across Canvaâ€™s threat landscape.

 **You're probably a match if**

  * You are currently enrolled and completing your studies between 2025 and mid-2026.
  * You are based in Australia or New Zealand and have working rights. Please note, Canva will not be able to sponsor visas and relocate for Early Talent roles.
  * Proficient with one or more modern program languages (Golang, Python or Java preferred).
  * You have an interest and passion for cyber security.
  * Ability to work with a range of Canvanauts from different backgrounds, with different expertise, and with different professional and personal needs.
