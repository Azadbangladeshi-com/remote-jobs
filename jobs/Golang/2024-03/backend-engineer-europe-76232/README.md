Neon is building open-source cloud-native PostgreSQL. Our architecture separates storage from compute, allowing for stateless and serverless Postgres. Weâ€™re a well-funded startup with deep knowledge of Postgres internals and decades of experience building databases.

Neon was created by a team of Postgres hackers and led by CEO Nikita Shamgunov (co-founder of SingleStore). Neon is built on open-source principles and is focused on giving back to the Postgres and developer communities.

### **Our Team**

  * We are a distributed team of 90 people working from 28 countries (concentrating around North American and European time zones)

  * Team with decades of experience building databases and deep knowledge of Postgres internals. We are deeply technical
  * We have experienced Postgres committers and hackers on the team (check Heikki, Anastasia, Arseny, Matthias profiles)
  * We believe in the efficacy of collaborative open-source
  * We aim for a diversity of thoughts and backgrounds

    * Venture vehicles of Snowflake and Databricks invested in Neon.
