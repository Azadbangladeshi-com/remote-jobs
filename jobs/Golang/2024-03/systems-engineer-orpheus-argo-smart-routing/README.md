**About Us**

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the worldâ€™s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazineâ€™s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the Worldâ€™s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.

We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

**What Youâ€™ll Do**

The Orpheus team was formed to own a very important aspect of Cloudflare's systems: enable more reliable network connectivity for Cloudflareâ€™s products than the Internet itself provides.  
  
Almost all products in Cloudflareâ€™s portfolio are or will be powered by Orpheus technology, including CDN, Spectrum, Magic Transit, Stream, Workers, Workers AI, R2, WARP, and more. As a member of the Orpheus team, youâ€™ll be a key technical contributor to the cutting edge network software infrastructure used by those products.

You will work closely with various Engineering teams to translate their requirements into new capabilities on the platform. Likewise you will partner with Network Engineering and SRE to ensure that the technology makes the best use of Cloudflare's world-class edge network.

You will participate in all stages of the software development lifecycle, from designing and documenting systems, to writing code and automated tests, to planning, managing, and monitoring production software deployments. You will work with a wide range of technologies and programming languages, including Rust, Go, Linux networking, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Kubernetes, and more.

Engineering teams at Cloudflare operate a Run What You Build model, including ours. We are responsible for the health of our system and participate in our team's on-call rotation as part of operational responsibilities.

Because youâ€™ll be solving problems of massive scale and significance, you are a growth-oriented individual who enjoys being outside of your comfort zone. You are comfortable in a fast-paced but sensible work environment. You value curiosity and empathy and lead with these values.

 **What Makes Cloudflare Special?**

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

**Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
