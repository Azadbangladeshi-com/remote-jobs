### Human Interest  
#### `üí∞ 308500.0` `üåé United States`  

**Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits.**

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often it‚Äôs because they are employed by a company that doesn‚Äôt offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

We‚Äôre a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. We‚Äôve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors. Most recently, by funding from BlackRock as well as many other top investors: TPG (The Rise Fund) with SoftBank led our Series D, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and others.

### About the role

 **This is an opportunity to evolve the customer strategy of a fast-growing company.**

Human Interest is rapidly expanding to help more businesses offer retirement benefits to their employees and we need an experienced product marketer to help us deliver our offering to a massive but fragmented market. Reporting to the Director of Revenue Marketing, this role will help us evolve our segmentation, positioning, and messaging strategy to maximize the value we deliver to our customers.

Product marketing is a new function for our company and as one of the first hires on this team, you will play a pivotal role in helping to define our strategy. You will be obsessed with our customers and endlessly advocate for better ways to reach and serve them. This is a highly cross-functional position that will partner with our Revenue and Product teams on a day-to-day basis to ensure they have the resources they need to communicate our value proposition and differentiation.

Revenue Marketing & Enablement is the backbone of the Revenue team, supporting Sales, Partnerships, Customer Onboarding, and Customer Service teams.

This high visibility position will put you front-and-center in front of all Revenue teams as well as Product, Engineering, and Legal/Compliance.
