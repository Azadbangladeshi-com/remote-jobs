Intuition Machines uses AI/ML to build enterprise security products. We apply our research to systems that serve hundreds of millions of people, with a team distributed around the world. You are probably familiar with our best-known product, the hCaptcha security suite. Our approach is simple: low overhead, small teams, and rapid iteration.

As Engineering Director, you will organize engineering efforts. This involves ensuring timely delivery of customer needs while upholding high code quality, security, and service availability standards. Additionally, you'll serve as a domain expert to review and guide architecture and implementation for our initiatives.

  * Lead the recruitment, motivation, and management of highly technical teams focused on delivering online security and machine learning products at scale.
  * Act as a liaison between product, engineering, customers, and sales to articulate and translate both complex business requirements and technology solutions into useful products.
  * Maintain a high level of assurance and software quality standards while maintaining development velocity; availability is core to nearly every requirement.
  * Define, drive, and govern automation and instrumentation to ensure we maintain high observability and automate break-fix as much as possible.
  * In partnership with sales and product teams, model go-to-market strategies for new offerings, oversee architecture, boost client acquisition capabilities, and improve delivery.
  * Implement effective hiring and onboarding strategies.

###  
What we are looking for:

  * A minimum of 5 years of hands-on experience leading engineering teams of 20-60 people.
  * Familiarity with high availability and high-security development processes, supported by strong knowledge of Python, NodeJS, and, ideally, C/C++, Go, or Rust.
  * Experience and demonstrated success with DevOps/systems integration, lightweight development practices, meeting strong SLAs, test-driven design in large scale internet-facing systems.
  * Familiarity with distributed systems design on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes: queue-first architectures, sharding, etc.
  * Strong interpersonal skills, ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences.
  * Demonstrated architecture and business/product need mapping expertise: gathering requirements, problem-solving, and reasoning about the best way forward given needs, timeline, and available resources.

###  
What do we offer:

  * Fully remote position with flexible working hours.
  * An inspiring team of colleagues spread all over the world.
  * Pleasant, modern development and deployment workflows: ship early, ship often.
  * High impact: lots of users, happy customers, high growth, and cutting edge R&D.
  * Flat organization, direct interaction with customer teams.

We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse global workforce. We believe that the best way to learn, grow, and succeed, both as individuals and as a company, is to foster a culture that is fundamentally rooted in equality.
