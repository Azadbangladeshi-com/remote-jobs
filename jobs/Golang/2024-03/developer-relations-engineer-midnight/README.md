### Summary

We are looking for a talented Developer Relations Engineer to join our team and help shape the future of Midnightâ€™s products and technology. Midnight is a regulatory-friendly data protection-based blockchain that safeguards sensitive commercial and personal data, protecting fundamental freedoms of association, commerce, and expression for developers, companies, and individuals.

As a Developer Relations Engineer, you will level up developers through education and enablement. We are here to get developers excited about software and to support them and their communities in achieving their goals.

We build in front of the world. We are creative and we embrace that energy to produce and share ambitious inspirational projects with deep technical roots.

The same discussions give us a chance to use our product expertise to make developersâ€™ lives better, by helping them understand the value of zero knowledge technology and how they can effectively apply it in their own projects.

We are developers and we love to code. We code so we can speak from practical experience and join the global conversation. You are going to be happiest on this team if you have lived the pain of pager duty and know the joy that comes from a beautiful green test suite. We are storytellers. We excite, engage, and empower our peers with stories of our own triumphs and failures in building. We are looking for compatriots with experience following their curiosity down the rabbit hole and bubbling back to the surface with treasure. We are active members of our communities. Collaborative personalities can expect to thrive here.
