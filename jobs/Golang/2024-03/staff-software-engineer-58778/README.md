  * You re-define operational excellence through monitoring, logging & tracing. You embrace a - you-build-it-you-run-it mentality in the team and the wider organisation.

    * Youâ€™ve been deploying, running & monitoring containerised software products using Kubernetes for more than 5 years in production.

    * You are an expert in designing and improving automated tests.
