  * Maintain up-to-date technical documentation
  * Collaborate with and assist team members with their issues
  * Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge on the protocol, whether it be high-level protocol details or technical details that are common to every client
  * Communicate effectively with the team and document your code and the client as a whole

#### Required skills and experience
