The International Emerging Markets team helps achieve our mission by bringing Reddit to billions of people in various international markets like India, Brazil, the Philippines etc. You will work on high-impact initiatives and features across all reddit product surfaces as a key member of the emerging markets team. Your work will help the next 500 million Redditors find communities, belonging, and empowerment on Reddit.

### How You'll Have Impact:

You will contribute to shaping and improving existing features. Youâ€™ll own projects from ideation to production instead of being stuck making small incremental gains on enterprise systems. Youâ€™ll work with a super-talented, cross-functional team to solve hard problems to create experiences that users will love. We are a team of builders that value impact, personal growth, openness, and kindness.

### Responsibilities:

  * Design, build, and ship backend services, experiments and products for millions of users to support our international growth.
  * Communicate effectively, within the team and across disciplines. Work closely with product managers and designers to craft compelling user experiences.
  * Contribute meaningfully to our teamâ€™s strategy. We give everyone a seat at the table and encourage active participation in planning our future. Donâ€™t just come along for the ride.
  * Participate in product reviews and team meetings, providing technical insight. Help scope, estimate, and prioritize between conflicting needs.
  * Foster a healthy engineering culture and collaborate with other engineers.

### Qualifications:

  * 3+ years of backend development experience with multiple parts of the backend stack, from databases to networking to computing infrastructure. We develop with Go, Python, Postgres, Redis, Thrift, gRPC, GraphQL and deploy to Docker/k8s on AWS.
  * Ability to design and implement complex distributed systems operating under high load.
  * Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and the ability to collaborate effectively with technical and non-technical teams in a fully remote environment.
  * Entrepreneurial spirit. You are self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You love to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.
  * Experience developing and shipping a large-scale customer-facing public application is preferred.
