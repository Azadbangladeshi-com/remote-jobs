### About The Role

We announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017 â€” since then itâ€™s played a key role in Cloudflareâ€™s strategy for entering the compute market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support.  
Over the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a complete full-stack platform. Weâ€™re growing this platform in new ways, and looking for a Product Manager to drive challenging initiatives, working directly with engineering teams across AI and GPU-based workloads, integrations with external tools and services, to new APIs and observability tooling for Cloudflare Workers.

### What Makes Cloudflare Special?

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

**Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
