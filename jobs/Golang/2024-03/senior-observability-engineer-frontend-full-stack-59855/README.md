### Canva  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Australia`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Delivering features, taking ownership of the entire lifecycle from design doc through to implementation and release.
  * Helping deliver monitoring of critical user flows through complete end-to-end tracing.
  * Helping identify gaps in Observability tooling at Canva and help take it to the next level.
  * Being proactive in modernising our Observability tooling and participating in brainstorming and POCâ€™ing to determine how we can improve our existing systems.
  * Being proactive and helping improve trace instrumentation on the frontend to surface performance degradation in our frontend components.
  * Helping develop solutions to tackle difficult problems such as scaling our platforms to meet Canva's customer growth.
  * Guiding and mentoring other people on the team and helping them grow their skills and knowledge.

### You're probably a match if

  * You have experience in TypeScript, which is a must for this role.
  * You have experience in Java or Golang which is a nice to have
  * You have deep knowledge and understanding of Computer Engineering fundamentals and first principles
  * You know Frontend performance metrics and web vitals.
  * You have experience working with and monitoring microservice architectures in large distributed cloud environments (ideally AWS).
  * You have experience with Observability tooling â€“ having proficiency with tools like Grafana, Kibana, Sentry, or similar
  * You have experience with infrastructure-as-code, weâ€™re a Terraform shop, but strong experience with other IaC tools will do the trick
  * You can guide and mentor other members of the team and improve the way we collaborate, learn, and share ideas
  * This role requires a lot of documentation and internal team membersâ€™ alignment; therefore strong written and verbal communication skills are required

### Not essential; but helpful experience!

  * Experience writing native code in Kotlin or Swift since we also maintain the tracing libraries for Android and iOS. 
  * Experience building custom plugins for Observability data visualisation tools like Kibana, Grafana, etc
  * Experience with OpenTelemetry or writing code in Golang since we are adopting OpenTelemetry in a lot of the tooling we provide.

### About the team

The Observability Traces & Exceptions Team is responsible for operational insights inside Canva. Our goal is to provide our development team with world-class tools to view how their services are performing in production. We achieve this by combining industry-leading third-party solutions with our own in-house developed solutions.

We work across the entire stack maintaining our tracing TypeScript & Java libraries, our tracing infrastructure, error libraries and error handling guidelines to name just a few. As we scale all of these areas, we require more sophisticated solutions to ensure that Canva developers can continue to grow without compromising on reliability or availability.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
