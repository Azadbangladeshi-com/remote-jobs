#### `ðŸ’° 405000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### **The Role**

As a Senior DevOps Engineer at Striveworks, you will be leading the charge on ensuring the robustness, reliability, efficiency, and automation of our development and operational environments as well as the design, engineering, and development operations for our products. You will be responsible for refining our software development/delivery process. You will have the opportunity to work with new, cloud-native technologies, and you will have the autonomy to select or engineer solutions to address the unique challenges posed by artificial intelligence data systems at both large and small scale. In addition to standard site reliability engineering tasksâ€”such as building software for monitoring and alerting, DevOps, and infrastructure automationâ€”you will have the opportunity to contribute to the design and deployment of our MLOps platform.

The anticipated base pay range for this position is $180,000â€“$225,000 per year. Striveworksâ€™ total compensation package includes a competitive base salary, annual performance-based equity grants, and a lucrative yearly cash bonus.

This position offers a fully remote work environment, or you can work hybrid/on site at our office in northwest Austin, TX.

### **The Right Fit**

We spend a lot of time during our hiring process talking about shared values.

**Why?** We passionately believe that fostering an environment where people can self-actualize and pursue greatness is the best way to achieve our individual and collective goals.

**What does this mean for you?** We want to provide you with the conditions to thrive in an environment where you can achieve your goals, where you know the team shares your goals, and where you make and accept decisions for the team with humility. At Striveworks, we want your say/do ratio to be 1, and we want you to know that being part of a top-tier team means that there is no smartest person in the room. If that makes sense, weâ€™re already on the same page.

### **Build, Deploy, and Maintain AI for an Unpredictable World**

AI is driving a new Industrial Revolution. But most AI tools only work when the world looks the same tomorrow as it did yesterday. That's rarely the case.  
Striveworks was formed to fix this problem. Our platform lets teams build AI models, deploy them into unpredictable environments, and watch them deliver trustworthy resultsâ€”day after day. Our approach has transformed AI outcomes for organizations where failure is never an option. As a result, Striveworks was recognized as an exemplar in the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence Final Report.

In 2023, Striveworks placed on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 as one of the most rapidly growing technology companies in North America. In 2024, Striveworks was honored with a Built In Best Places to Work awardâ€”for the third year running.
