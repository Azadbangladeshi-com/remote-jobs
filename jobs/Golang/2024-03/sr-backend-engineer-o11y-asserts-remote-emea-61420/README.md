### What do we do?

The Asserts.ai team joined Grafana Labs as part of an acquisition and is now growing inside the larger Observability group. The backend team is responsible for building and operating a set of low-latency microservices built in Java and databases like Graph DB. The services provide automated Root Cause Insights by actively querying the Grafana Cloud Metrics, Traces, and Logs databases and integrating with the Grafana platform components like Dashboarding and Alerting. The Asserts services are multi-tenant, highly available and process and store data in Graph and Timeseries DB. We will soon be rolling it out to thousands of self-service customers, and it's critical that as we grow, we improve our performance, increase our reliability, and do it all more efficiently.

Grafana is trusted by major organizations worldwide, monitoring critical infrastructure. We thrive on collective creativity and diverse perspectives. Every team member is encouraged to contribute ideas that shape our product into a dependable tool.

###  **Requirements:**

  * You have solid Java programming experience. Asserts services are built on Java. All our core databases are built on Go.
  * You have worked on a big SaaS platform and dealt with common distributed systems problems (e.g., scalability, multi-tenancy, data isolation, HA, â€¦)
  * You have used K8s or a public Cloud for operating your software and were responsible for operating the software you have built. 
  * You are passionate about writing clean, robust, and performant software that is easily maintained by others
  * You have prior experience in owning customers' experience by participating in weekday 12h x 5d and separate weekend 24h x 2d on-call rotations.
  * Collaboration and communication: As we are remote-first and our engineering organization is mainly remote, good communication skills, ability to work independently and collaborate with distributed teams is a must.

### **Nice to haves:**

  * Been a user of Grafana and Prometheus in operational roles (including on-call for your team at a previous employer or just using these tools on hobby/homelab projects)
  * Familiarity with GoLang

### **What will you be doing?**

  * Drive projects from initial ideation all the way to operations once it is in the hands of customers.
  * Take on complex challenges and break them down to achieve short feedback loops: to analyze, design, and build modular solutions, deliver MVPs, gather data and feedback, and then progress iteratively
  * Maintain critical systems, and own their reliability, performance, and availability.
  * Be a part of your teamâ€™s on-call rotations and take ownership of the services youâ€™re running.
  * Mentor and support other team members, participate in design discussions, and collaborate with the team
  * Learn new skills by gaining a deeper understanding of our cloud product and our customers and getting to know the codebase.
