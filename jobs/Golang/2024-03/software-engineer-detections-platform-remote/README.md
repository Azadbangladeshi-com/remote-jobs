Description

â€‹â€‹#WeAreCrowdStrike and our mission is to stop breaches. As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. Weâ€™re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to the customer to join us in shaping the future of cybersecurity. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.

 **About The Role:**

Crowdstrike is looking for a Sr. Cloud Engineer to join our growing Detections Platform team. The cloud side of the detections platform works in conjunction with on-endpoint code to detect security problems and incidents, automatically stop adversaries in their tracks, and provide actionable data to customers. We process massive amounts of data, distilling it down to the elements that customers need to see. We also provide tools and services that allow other product teams at Crowdstrike to rapidly develop and deploy new functionality. Detections Platform is involved across the entire product line and youâ€™ll work closely with other groups across the company.

As a Sr. Cloud Engineer in Detections Platform, youâ€™ll help us build the next generation of cloud-side detections processing. This may include evolving our near-real-time endpoint-to-cloud communications, or integrating with new machine-learning models. You will work closely with the Data Science team to operationalize new models for generating cloud detections. Your responsibilities will include defining processes and tools to enable the model handoff, automating processes where necessary, deploying the models at scale and defining metrics and alerts. Youâ€™ll be thinking about how to build high-quality systems that scale cleanly and reliably, and then implementing those ideas primarily in Go (and also some Python). Prior experience with Go is not required, but will be helpful.

CrowdStrike is a computer security company, but we do not require candidates for this role to have prior security industry experience. We will mentor and train in security topics as needed. We do expect a strong interest in CrowdStrike's mission and a willingness to engage with the needs of our product teams and customers.

 **What You'll Do:**

  * Leveraging and building cloud based systems to detect targeted attacks at a global scale.

  * Brainstorming, designing, and building collaboratively with members across multiple teams.

  * Mentoring and helping your fellow Crowdstrike engineers grow.

  * Delivering and accepting feedback with grace and courtesy.

  * Building elegant solutions for complex technical problems in Go.

  * Reading code in the multiple programming languages in use in our environment (Go, Python, Unix shell, among others).

  * Collaborating with Data Scientists and Data Engineers to define processes and metrics around model efficacy, handoff and deployment.

  * Driving efforts to automate processes around model testing, handoff and deployment.

  * Focusing on continual learning, raising the bar for both yourself and your teammates.

  * Leveraging our understanding of engineering best practices, including topi **cs** like appropriate testing paradigms, effective peer code reviews, logging, and resilient architecture patterns, to ensure that our code is clean.

  * Being an energetic â€˜self-starterâ€™ with the ability to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.

 **What You'll Need:**

  * A computer science background or equivalent experience (programming styles, data structures, algorithms, distributed systems, etc.)

  * 5+ years of experience building and scaling back-end systems in production.

  * Team player skills â€“ we embrace collaboration.

  * Deep understanding of distributed systems and scalability challenges.

  * Understanding of Cassandra, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Redis.

  * Prior experience with any of: Go, Scala, Python, Java, C#, or C++

  * Prior experience with cloud services, such as AWS or Azure, particularly compute and storage offerings.

  * Experience developing and deploying into Linux.

 **Bonus Points:**

  * Computer and/or network security experience.

  * Prior implementation experience with Go and Python.

  * Prior experience working within scalable microservices architectures.

  * Prior experience with containerization and container orchestration technology such as docker and Kubernetes.

  * Familiarity with DevOps practices and tools.

If you have some but not all of the qualifications, but bring a passion for cybersecurity, weâ€™d like to talk.
