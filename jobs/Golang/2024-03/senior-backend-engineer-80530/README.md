### About us:

We‚Äôre here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.

We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.

We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.

 **We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive.**

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone. You can read more in our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Reportand 2021 Gender Pay Gap Report.

### About our Engineering Teams:

We have around 300 engineers out of roughly 2,500 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you‚Äôll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.

We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blogis a good place to learn even more about what we do!

### What you‚Äôll be working on:

We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:

  * Go to write our application code (there‚Äôs an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
  * Cassandra for most persistent data storage
  * Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
  * Envoy Proxy for RPC
  * Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services 
  * AWS for most of our infrastructure
  * React for internal web dashboards
  * We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties

They‚Äôre all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now, we do a standard interview process across all our collectives and at the end we will find the best match for you based on your skills, experience, preferences and aligning with the business need!
