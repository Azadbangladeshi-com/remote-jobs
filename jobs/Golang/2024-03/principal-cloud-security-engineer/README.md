Description

Arctic Wolf, with its unicorn valuation, is the leader in security operations in an exciting and fast-growing industryâ€”cybersecurity. We have won countless awards for our excellence in security operations and remain dedicated to providing an industry-leading customer and employee experience.

Our mission is simple: End Cyber Risk. Weâ€™re looking for a **Principal Cloud Security Engineer** to be a part of making this happen.

 _ **About the role:**_

As a Principal Cloud Security Engineer, you will be the brains and backbone of the Cloud Security team, strongly focused on ensuring the security of the Arctic Wolf infrastructure via all available means and channels. This is a hands-on position with a strong focus on raising the bar for Cloud Security throughout the organization. You will work largely within AWS (Azure coming soon!), and we do everything-as-code.

The focus of this role is on helping identify, champion, and ensure improvements to our ability to Protect and Detect within our product space - defining, deploying, managing and improving the use and usability of cloud and other infrastructure security tooling. This means services like GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config, Security Hub, Detective, Inspector, SSM, Security Lake, as well as platforms like Kubernetes, but may also take you into areas unknown as part of your goal of keeping Cloud Security in the forefront and provide the best protection we can for Arctic Wolf and our customers.

In addition, you will lead the continuous effort to improve and simplify access control into and throughout our Cloud environments, with work largely focused on AWS IAM and CloudTrail Lake, along with custom tooling to enable least-privilege and just-in-time access.

You will frequently work independently - representing the team with other parts of the organization, understanding our strategic and tactical goals. You will act as an extension of the leaders of the team, and be extensively involved in our strategy and planning.

Finally, you will help get to the root of security risks and events at Arctic Wolf - acting as the SME for high impact incidents, engaging with teams to support design improvements, gathering and defining our roadmap, pushing vendors and driving improvement, and always looking at how we can automate away toil. You will work with our security tooling and vendors to drive improvements, as well as keeping a finger on the pulse of the industry to ensure we arenâ€™t behind.

This work will be heavily focused on AWS, but will also branch out to include Azure and GCP, as well as delving into moving forward security for other platforms like Kubernetes.

 _ **What you might accomplish in the first six months, based on your interests:**_

  * Identify a gap, then define, deploy and operationalize a new AWS security service or feature using IaC

  * Act as a SME in response to infrastructure security events and incidents, follow up with RCA and help stop repeats

 ** _Responsibilities_ :**

  * Build significant automation to remove the operational toil for the Cloud Security and other teams

  * Unafraid of ambiguity - proficient at taking an idea, soliciting feedback and input, then figuring out how to translate an idea to work units and then to reality
