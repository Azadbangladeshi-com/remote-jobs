 **About the Team**

Meet Bagavathy Kumar - The hiring manager

I joined Nutanix in December 2019 with excitement to integrate various hardware technologies and how they solve end customer use cases in an optimal way.

My professional career mostly revolved around building Enterprise Data Center products (BIOS/Boot loaders, BMC, PCIe IO cards, RAID Controller, SSD & Storage systems), which also gave me to solve complex issues with vertical hardware/software integrations. I have very good knowledge of x86_64 system architecture, server hardware components and operating system internals, which helped me understand Nutanix‚Äôs HCI architecture and design integrated systems.

We are looking for passionate candidates who have experience in x86 server technologies and willing to learn something new every day.

The pay range for this position at commencement of employment is expected to be between USD $ 128,800 and USD $ 258,000 per year.

However, base pay offered may vary depending on multiple individualized factors, including market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. The total compensation package for this position may also include other elements, including a sign-on bonus, restricted stock units, and discretionary awards in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits (including 401(k) eligibility and various paid time off benefits, such as vacation, sick time, and parental leave), dependent on the position offered. Details of participation in these benefit plans will be provided if an employee receives an offer of employment.

If hired, employee will be in an ‚Äúat-will position‚Äù and the Company reserves the right to modify base salary (as well as any other discretionary payment or compensation program) at any time, including for reasons related to individual performance, Company or individual department/team performance, and market factors.
