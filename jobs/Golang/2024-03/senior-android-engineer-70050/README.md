### Mission

 **Speechify is the easiest way to listen to the world’s information.** Articles on the web, documents in the cloud, books on your phone. We absorb it all and let you listen to it at your desk, on the go, at your own speed, and with tools that make learning easier, deeper, and faster.

What streaming services have done for audio entertainment, we’re doing for audio information. And whatever we’re doing seems to be working. We’re #1 in our category, and experiencing exponential growth.

### Overview

We are a fully remote international startup, so this is not a typical 9-5 job, but rather a very dynamic role. Among the things you are expected attend important meetings, and take complete responsibility as a directly responsible individual.
