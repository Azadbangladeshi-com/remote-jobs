We enjoy competitive compensation and benefits packages, and reward and recognize our employees for exceptional results.

We know that when our people are rewarded, recognized, and rejuvenated, we win as a team.

We are a fully remote software engineering team working on the company's next generation security platform. Our goal is to increase the security posture of all of our customers while building a collaborative and innovative engineering culture. We are a proud member of the Dell Technologies family and offer competitive benefit and compensation packages and reward and recognize our employees for exceptional results.

The platform team focuses on backend service and tooling development for other teams and customers to use. We build performant GraphQL APIs using Golang and Kubernetes for different features of our product, creating and reviewing designs for new projects, building robust software that other teams and customers can use, and collaborating with other internal and external engineering teams to solve problems, as well as building our internal authorization systems. If there is backend work we are involved in one way or another - and our goal as a team is to raise the bar of engineering practices across the larger organization.

Our primary tech stack consists of Golang, Kubernetes, Postgres, and Elasticsearch, but we also use tools like ScyllaDB, Redis, Kafka, SQS, and various other AWS services as well.

**Required Experience:**

  * Minimum of 1 year of experience with programming languages such as Go Lang, Python, or Java.
  * Minimum of 1 year of experience with at least one of the following technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, GraphQL, Postgres, Elasticsearch, ScyllaDB, Redis, Kafka, SQS, Docker, or AWS services.
  * Must be pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, CIS/MIS, Cybersecurity, Statistics, or related fields.
  * Demonstrated proficiency in software programming, either through coursework, projects, personal projects, or professional experience.

 **Desired Experience:**

  * Remote work experience with a geographically distributed team (currently we have teammates in PST to GMT time zones)
  * Software development experience in Go

 **Work Environment**

We are a remote first team and are geographically distributed across the US, Canada, and UK - we utilize tools like Mattermost, Google Meet and Zoom to facilitate communication and tools like Miro and Lucid Charts for diagramming and communicating ideas. We also believe in a strong work-life balance and providing support for team members to accomplish that. We are a family first company that values our team members and has benefits and a culture that will help them through important life events - such as taking care of family, parental leave, etc. We also value continuing education and skills development and have Tech Tuesdays where team members can present to the engineering organization, 3rd parties coming in and giving presentations, as well as training for services like AWS and Kubernetes.
