  * Experience designing and maintaining scalable public APIs
  * Ability to thrive in ambiguous environments where you get to work directly with stakeholders with minimal guidance and direction

 _ **Compensation Range**_

 _$180-220k For cash compensation, we set standard ranges for all **US based roles based** on function, level and geographic location, benchmarked against similar stage growth companies. In order to be compliant with local legislation, as well as to provide greater transparency to candidates, we share salary ranges on all job postings regardless of desired hiring location. **Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including geographic location as well as candidate experience and expertise, and may vary from the amounts listed above.**_

Offers vary depending on, but not limited to, relevant experience, education, certifications/licenses, skills, training, and market conditions.

Due to regulatory and security reasons, thereâ€™s a small number of countries where we cannot have Fingerprint teammates based. **Additionally, because Fingerprint is an all-remote company and people can join our workforce from almost any country, we do not sponsor visas. Fingerprint teammates need to be authorized to work from their home location**.

We are dedicated to creating an inclusive work environment for everyone. We embrace and celebrate the unique experiences, perspectives and cultural backgrounds that each employee brings to our workplace. Fingerprint strives to foster an environment where our employees feel respected, valued and empowered, and our team members are at the forefront in helping us promote and sustain an inclusive workplace.
