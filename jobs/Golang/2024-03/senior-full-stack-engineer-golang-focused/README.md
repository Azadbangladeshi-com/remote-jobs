## **Our Technology**

We use a lot of different technologies to get the job done, and each member of our team brings their own mix of technology experience. If you have familiarity with even a few of these (or equivalents), you could make a valuable contribution: Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, React, Gitlab, MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, Kubernetes, Kafka, lots of AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora, Kinesis).

We invest our time and our money in organizations that are not only working to diversify the current jobscape, but also investing in the future of talent. Weâ€™re motivated by a strong, innovative, and passionate work culture and weâ€™re constantly searching for ways to improve and get shift done.

### **Whether youâ€™re a perfect match or not, if it sounds like a good fit, we encourage you to apply.**

Are you hesitant to submit an application because you're not sure if you check every box? Apply anyway! We would love to hear from you and figure out what you can add to the culture here at When I Work._
