At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn‚Äôt do this without hiring the best people. We‚Äôre a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they‚Äôre trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That‚Äôs us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We‚Äôre a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.
