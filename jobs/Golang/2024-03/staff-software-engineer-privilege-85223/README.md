Description

**About SailPoint**

SailPoint is the leader in identity security for the cloud enterprise. Our identity security solutions secure and enable thousands of companies worldwide, giving our customers unmatched visibility into the entirety of their digital workforce, ensuring workers have the right access to do their job â€“ no more, no less.

Built on a foundation of AI and ML, our Identity Security Cloud Platform, Atlas delivers the right level of access to the right identities and resources at the right timeâ€”matching the scale, velocity, and changing needs of todayâ€™s cloud-oriented, modern enterprise.

 **About the team**

Youâ€™ll be joining the newly formed Privilege team, helping them build Privileged Access Management and Privileged Process Automation within the Identity Security Cloud Platform.

The team is fully remote, UK-based, and, as a small team, you will be a key contributor.

 **The role**

In a typical day youâ€™ll be working in Golang to deliver on the vision for the new product. In bridging a cloud-based SaaS offering with corporate infrastructure devices, thereâ€™ll be a mix of developing microservices in the cloud and containerised services running on Virtual Appliances within customersâ€™ networks.

There are some interesting constraints, for example we want to ensure that customer-owned, privileged credentials are only available in plaintext within a customer-controlled environment, and this requires careful use of cryptography.

In 90 days, youâ€™d be on-boarded and landing work in collaboration with the tech lead.

In 6 months, youâ€™d be operating with a high degree of autonomy to deliver on the team goals.

In 1 year, youâ€™d be a Subject Matter Expert able to run projects as the team grows.

  * Deliver efficient, maintainable, robust features.
  * Collaborate with peers on designs, code reviews, and testing.

  * Testing & Debugging - unit & integration tests, including strategies for exercising external integrations; familiarity with debug & performance profiling tools
  * Microservices & SaaS
