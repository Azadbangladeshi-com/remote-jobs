#### About the department

Cloudflareâ€™s Engineering Team builds and runs the software that handles trillions of requests per month. Product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base.

The Cloudflare for Teams group within the Engineering organization is taking on the mission of ensuring the people and teams within an organization can access the tools they need to do their job safe from malware and other online threats with the speed and reliability that Cloudflare is known for.

#### What you'll do

In this role youâ€™ll help us build Gateway, an ambitious product that aims to be the most secure and performant method for an organizationâ€™s devices to connect to the Internet. As an engineer on the Gateway team, you will focus on our high-performance global edge network data plane services and will also contribute to the control plane APIâ€™s that configure the edge services. You will be joining a global team of bright, hard-working, and supportive engineers who really care about their craft.

Example of systems that the team currently is building:

  * A forward-proxy service running on every machine of Cloudflareâ€™s extensive edge network, responsible for inspecting, filtering, and blocking device requests based on an organizationâ€™s configured policy.
  * A DNS resolver running on our edge that leverages a Wirefilter based filtering rules engine.
  * Microservices that allow organizations to configure, manage, and observe their organization's devices and their respective traffic.

### Technologies we use:

  * Gatewayâ€™s core edge services are written in Rust and deployed globally to 200+ data centers 
  * Our REST API is written in Go, runs on Kubernetes, and uses Postgres as a data store.
  * Our frontend is written in Typescript and React.
  * For service monitoring we use Prometheus and Grafana.
  * For service logging we use Elasticsearch and Kibana.
  * For product analytics we use Clickhouse and BigQuery. 

Because youâ€™ll be solving problems of massive scale and significance, and shaping the future of the Internet, you are a growth-oriented individual who enjoys being outside of your comfort zone in a fast-paced environment.

 **Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience**

### What Makes Cloudflare Special?

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

 **Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
