### What We're Looking For

Stytch is the most powerful identity platform built for developers. With advanced features like device fingerprinting and account takeover-resistant authentication, Stytch provides the infrastructure to make your companyâ€™s identity and access management secure, reliable, and scalable. As a backend-leaning experienced full-stack engineer, you'll partner with leadership to ensure that our product experiences are truly best-in-class by architecting solutions across our technology stack, overseeing the design and execution of the teamâ€™s projects, and ultimately working on the most critical projects on our product roadmap.

### What Excites You

  * A collaborative environment with a tight feedback loop between the work you do and the impact it has on users

  * Mentoring engineers across Stytch â€” you have a passion for helping engineers grow and learn and are excited to help grow the future engineering leaders of the company

  * Designing for the future, and building for the present â€” you have a vision for the systems you work on, but know how to build incremental milestones, and when to make trade-offs between completeness and utility to get to value fast

  * You love code â€” youâ€™re a pro at building roadmaps and design docs, but you donâ€™t like stopping there. Youâ€™re incredibly proud of the code you write and review, and like staying close to the systems you own

  * Putting your stamp on the team â€” shaping the culture and growing the team through recruiting leadership and senior engineers, and working closely with engineering managers to develop the operations and processes that allow the team to execute at the highest level

  * Building products that make developers lives easier â€” both internally and externally. Youâ€™re excited to make our systems easy to use and safe for internal developers, as well as the impact your work will have on Stytchâ€™s customers.

### What Excites Us

  * 5+ years as a backend or backend-leaning full-stack engineer

  * Familiarity with frontend (ability to debug on FE as needed, but FE expertise not required)

  * Familiarity with Go, Node.js, TypeScript, and React

### What Success Looks Like

  * Technical â€” build new, highly reliable services that our customers can depend on in their critical path. Improve our existing systems to be both delightful and safe to build on for Stytch developers, as well as performant, reliable, and secure for our customers.

  * Ownership â€” partner with your manager to build the roadmap for the team, partner with product to prioritize the most critical work and projects, and then ship it to production

  * Leadership â€” level up the team and the industry by growing the next generation of full-stack engineers at Stytch

 **Our Tech Stack**

  * Go for backend services

  * Node and Typescript for our web services

  * Next.js and React/Typescript on the frontend

  * We run on AWS with Kubernetes for containerization

  * gRPC and protobufs for internal service communication
