    * Validator registry: Staking and rewards.
  * Build token simulations across various EVM chains (mainnet, L2s, sidechains).
  * Lead smart contracts security audits.
  * Follow the latest EVM smart contract developments.

### You also likely:

  * Have 5+ years of production-level software experience.
  * Have 2+ years of production-level Solidity experience.
  * Have some interest in TypeScript, Golang, or Rust.
  * Are an excellent communicator and writer.
  * Are incredibly curious, professional, personable, and self-directed.
  * Have track-record of influencing and making critical decisions.
  * Have open-source project experience.
  * Have attention to detail with a passion for software architecture and design.

### Perks:

  * Contribute to technology at the forefront of the web.

  * An entrepreneurial opportunity where you can have oversized impacts.
  * Opportunity to drive innovation and strategy.
  * Your work will be open source.

### Location

Textile is a fully remote company spanning GMT -8 to GMT +1 (North America, South America, Central Europe). While being small, we've found that it is helpful to have a high level of overlap as a team.
