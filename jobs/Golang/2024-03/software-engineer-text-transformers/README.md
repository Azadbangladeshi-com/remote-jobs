As a venture-backed generative AI startup, we're expanding the $100B+ in awards granted to injury victims every year. We recognize the challenges faced by millions of ordinary people in seeking justice, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds. Our vision is to level the playing field, regardless of income or demographics.

 **About EvenUp:**

EvenUp is a venture-backed generative AI startup that ensures injury victims are awarded the full value of their claims, expanding the $100B+ in awards granted to injury victims each year. Every year, the legal system has made it difficult for millions of ordinary people to seek justice, especially for folks without means or who come from underrepresented backgrounds.

EvenUp operates across a variety of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents and negligence claims. Our ML-driven software empowers attorneys to accurately assess the value of these cases by doing a core part of their workflow (legal drafting), enabling them to secure larger settlements in record time. As EvenUp evaluates more cases, our proprietary data grows, enhancing the precision of our predictions and delivering more value to both attorneys and victims alike.

We are one of the fastest growing startups ($0 to $10M in ARR in <2 years) and are funded by some of the best investors in the world, including Signalfire, Bain, and Bessemer, who led our recent $50M Series B.
