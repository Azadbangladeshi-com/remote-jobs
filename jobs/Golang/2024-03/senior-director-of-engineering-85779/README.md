**About Zscaler**

Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS) accelerates digital transformation so that customers can be more agile, efficient, resilient, and secure. The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange is the companyâ€™s cloud-native platform that protects thousands of customers from cyberattacks and data loss by securely connecting users, devices, and applications in any location.

With more than 10 years of experience developing, operating, and scaling the cloud, Zscaler serves thousands of enterprise customers around the world, including 450 of the Forbes Global 2000 organizations. In addition to protecting customers from damaging threats, such as ransomware and data exfiltration, it helps them slash costs, reduce complexity, and improve the user experience by eliminating stacks of latency-creating gateway appliances.

Zscaler was founded in 2007 with a mission to make the cloud a safe place to do business and a more enjoyable experience for enterprise users. Zscalerâ€™s purpose-built security platform puts a companyâ€™s defenses and controls where the connections occurâ€”the internetâ€”so that every connection is fast and secure, no matter how or where users connect or where their applications and workloads reside.

In this role you will build a unified zero-trust CI/CD platform that delivers the entire portfolio of Zscaler services to commercial, federal and sovereign environments.

You will architect and deliver cloud build-out automation for Zscaler to run unattended and be operated by the 3rd party at arm's length. Through collaboration with compliance and security organizations you will harden artifact delivery pipeline from source control submission to deployment, ensuring Zscaler binaries meet stringent requirements. Through partnership with engineering organizations you will enable rapid pace of innovation using the latest and greatest technology DevSecOps has to offer. You will be able to redefine roles and responsibilities of various functions within engineering organizations and enable people to focus on what they do best - use their creativity and passion to address tough industry challenges, while automation and AI do the rest in the background.

The success of your work will determine the growth trajectory of Zscaler business in federal and sovereign markets. Your work is mission critical for Zscaler and offers tremendous growth opportunities.
