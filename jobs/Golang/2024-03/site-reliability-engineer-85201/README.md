PTC is looking for hands-on engineer, experienced with site reliability and operations, for a leading PLM SaaS solution.

 **Your Day-to-Day Work**  
  
 **Automation**  
SRE engineers build tools for automation to manage platform operations. Thus, instead of manually performing these functions, their aim is to automate them. Such functions include:

  * Continuous delivery, and Deployment
  * Toil reduction, and operations automation
  * Monitoring
  * Rapid Incident response
  * Alerts

 **Monitoring**  
SRE engineers are responsible for ensuring that the underlying infrastructure is running smoothly, and that systems and tools are working as expected.  
They also monitor critical applications and services to minimize downtime and ensure their availability.

 **Issue resolution**  
The engineer works closely with developers, especially when issues arise so they will collaborate with developers to help with troubleshooting and provide consultation when alerts are issued.

This engineer will investigate and then resolve the issue in the event that a developer runs into a problem. Following the incident resolution, the engineer will revisit the issue and determine the cause to ensure it doesnâ€™t happen again.

 **Cross team collaboration**  
Based on the above, SREs work across different teams, mainly operations and development. By building reliable systems and providing support to these teams, this will give these teams more time to divert their attention to building new features and hence get these out faster to customers.

 **Requirements**

  * Experience building automated monitoring tools like **Datadog** , Dynatrace, Splunk, SumoLogic etc
