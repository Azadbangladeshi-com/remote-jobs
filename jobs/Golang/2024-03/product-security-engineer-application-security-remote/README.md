Description

#WeAreCrowdStrike and our mission is to stop breaches. As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing over 1 trillion events a day with a petabyte of RAM deployed in our Cassandra clusters - and this traffic is growing daily. Weâ€™re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to developing and shaping our cybersecurity platform. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.

 **About The Role**

Help us protect CrowdStrike and its customers from the most advanced threats by securing our applications. CrowdStrikeâ€™s Product Security team breaks the mold of traditional internal security, and focuses on active threats to CrowdStrikeâ€™s products. As an Application Security Engineer you will dig into web applications, find design and implementation flaws, help our product engineers fix defects, and play a role in shipping secure code. Youâ€™ll hunt for security defects and play a part in fixing those defects rather than just reporting them and hoping for the best. Additionally, you will be involved in cross-cutting projects to further harden internal systems and processes against active and emerging threats.

 **What Youâ€™ll Do:**

  * Join engineering teams working on applications as a security expert and advisor, influencing the design and capabilities of our products

  * Create and maintain threat models to drive security decisions and minimize threat surface area

  * Review application source code, looking for security defects and risk

  * Attack applications throughout the Secure Development LifeCycle

  * Work with developers to help them understand defects, risks, design weaknesses, etc. and implement proven solutions

  * Build integrated tools and automation to make life easier for you, your team, and our engineering partners

  * Assist in responding to our bug bounty program, hunt for similar issues, and improve the security of our applications

Weâ€™re hiring this role at multiple levels, so we still want to hear from you even if you think you canâ€™t do all of that â€“ or if you can do more!

 **What Youâ€™ll Need:**

  * An understanding of how software products are created and shipped in Agile/DevOps like environments 

  * Basic experience with threat modeling, especially using STRIDE

  * Some experience in code review for apps built with Go (Golang), Python, Rust, or JavaScript (emphasis on browser-side) 

  * Knowledge of secure configuration of cloud-native and containerized apps in one or more Cloud environments (GCP, Azure, AWS)

  * Experience using and/or maintaining commercially available AppSec tools like SAST, DAST, IAST, and ASPM suites

  * An understanding of common software weaknesses that impact cloud and web applications (not just the OWASP Top 10) and experience in application penetration testing

  * Comfort with collaborating across technical teams: asking technical questions, challenging assumptions, getting or providing context for decisions, etc.

 **Bonus Points:**

These skills are not required and/or weâ€™re willing to teach them, but they are helpful.

  * Self-motivated to identify security problems and engage with teams to find solutions

  * Demonstrable experience developing/maintaining automation for application security tasks and defect identification

  * Example(s) of having a positive working relationship with product engineers (software product development experience is a huge bonus)

  * Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes (k8s)

  * Experience with WebAssembly (WASM)

  * Engaged in providing security enhancements to open source projects

  
 **Education/Certifications:**

Technical security certifications or academic background are a plus.
