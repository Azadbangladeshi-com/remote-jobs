### Volt  
#### `ðŸ’° 190000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Volt is transforming the massive and rapidly growing communications platform industry ($400B). Backed by some of the worldâ€™s leading venture capital investors, we are on an ambitious mission: To make leveraging communication infrastructure easy for software companies. Our work is to improve developer experience and lower total cost of ownership by building a fully managed messaging infrastructure stack, so that software teams can focus on building applications that delight users.

### About the Role

Volt is hiring Product & Software Engineers to join our rapidly scaling product development team. As one of Voltâ€™s early engineers, you will play a key role in the success of our team achieving our mission. You will be challenged to solve novel technical and DX challenges, work close to users on a product-minded team, and given freedom to contribute where you can create the greatest impact.

### Technical Challenges

### A few things you will experience:

  * Work with a huge amount of data at scale and database tables with hundreds of millions of rows.
  * Strong focus on users and product innovation â€” engineers are front-and-center in our product development and decision making processes. You will be directly involved in customer research, designing and implementing features, measuring product results, and iteration.
  * Very agile but non-dogmatic development environment, deploying several times each day
  * Develop solutions to novel technical and developer experience problems â€” we are building the first true platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for mobile messaging.

### Where

We are remote-first. If youâ€™re local, our office is open and available to you â€” we are based out of the One Technology Center in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma.

### About us:

  * We are a small, quickly growing team of relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurs and startup veterans.
  * We are building a growth-oriented, inclusive, passionate team that learns while doing and challenges each other to accomplish extraordinary things.
  * We believe in ownership and transparency. We all take responsibility, and no team member will ever need permission to make a difference for our team or for our users.

### Requirements

 **If you donâ€™t match all of these, donâ€™t be discouraged from applying. We understand that learning new stacks and codebases are a part of joining any team.**

  * 4+ years of software engineering experience, preferably in a high growth startup environment
  * A collaborative, pragmatic, user-focused mindset. We are a small but focused team and everyone must be aligned on our goals.
  * Experience with performance and optimization problems, and an ability to resolve and prevent them
  * Experience across the stack in production web and server codebases with sophisticated use of relational database systems
  * The ability to build within unfamiliar systems and write maintainable, well-tested code
  * The ability to thrive in a remote-first organization
  * A desire to help build a strong, healthy engineering culture

### Technologies We Use

  * Languages: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go (golang)
  * Infrastructure + Tools: Postgres, Redis, AWS, Docker, Git, React

### Benefits

This will be a salaried position. Volt provides health, dental, vision, and life insurance at no extra cost to employees. The salary range for this position is $70,000 to $120,000 depending on experience in startups and software development, and a significant additional portion of compensation is equity in the form of stock options.
