Description

#WeAreCrowdStrike and our mission is to stop breaches. As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing over 1 trillion events a day with a petabyte of RAM deployed in our Cassandra clusters - and this traffic is growing daily. Weâ€™re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to developing and shaping our cybersecurity platform. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.

 **About the Role:**

Organizations are scaling their data environments at an increasing rate, leaving massive gaps in visibility into activity on endpoints, in particular knowing what endpoints are there to begin with! These evolving, heterogeneous environments are immensely difficult to protect because thereâ€™s no single-pane-of-glass visibility clarifying what machines (both virtual and physical) comprise the environment to begin with.  

We are growing and we are seeking a **Software Engineering Manager** for our Falcon Exposure Management product cloud team in the US.

This is an Engineering Manager role that is responsible for owning and delivering product features for CrowdStrike from concept to release and support.

Your team of backend-focused developers works primarily in Golang, using AWS-native services, operating under the modern â€˜end-to-end ownershipâ€™ model that requires full lifecycle ownership of your services, and makes use of distributed/miroservices based architecture to build features for our highly available cloud SaaS, the Falcon Platform (see specific products above)!

 **What You'll Do:**

  * Help in building globally distributed, fault tolerant and highly scalable cloud-based critical systems that process over 350 billion events per day.

  * Provide leadership and growth for a team of software engineers, guiding them toward successful and timely completion of various technical product development projects.

  * Be instrumental in the hiring, retaining and growth of our software engineers.

  * You will work cross functionally with your peers in the engineering organization as well as leaders in sales and product.

 **What You'll Need:**

  * Demonstrated track record of building and leading a high performing core engineering team.

  * 7\+ years of software engineering experience in all phases of a software development lifecycle.

  * 3+ years of hands-on management experience leading engineering teams.

  * A solid grounding in the technology of at least one cloud environment (AWS, Azure, GCP).

  * Broad grounding in all aspects of distributed systems development: understanding of distributed systems concepts and API development.

  * Solid design and problem-solving skills with a demonstrated passion for engineering excellence, quality, security, and performance.

  * MS in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent work experience.

  * You will work closely with product management to understand the customer requirements and contribute to the delivery roadmap for the product.

  * We are a remote-first company so you must bring your excellent verbal and written communication skills to bear when you are working with your engineering teams and cross-functional teams across the globe.

 **Bonus Points:**

  * Exposure to/experience with cybersecurity and intelligence.

  * Experience in Golang and/or container and container orchestration technologies.
