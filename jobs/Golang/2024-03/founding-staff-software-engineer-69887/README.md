### About Paxos

Todayâ€™s financial infrastructure is archaic, expensive, inefficient and risky â€” supporting a system that leaves out more people than it lets in. So weâ€™re rebuilding it.

Weâ€™re on a mission to open the worldâ€™s financial system to everyone by enabling the instant movement of any asset, any time, in a trustworthy way. For over a decade, weâ€™ve built blockchain infrastructure that tokenizes, custodies, trades and settles assets for the worldâ€™s leading financial institutions, like PayPal, Venmo, Mastercard and Interactive Brokers.
