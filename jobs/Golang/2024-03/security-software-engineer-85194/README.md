### Responsibilities

  1. Research and author detection rules in Sigma format. Your top responsibility will be to create out-of-the-box detection rules in Stellar Cyberâ€™s Open XDR platform. These rules will be covering various areas in need, such as endpoints (e.g., Windows, Linux), cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure), SaaS (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace), and network (e.g., DNS metadata).
  2. Manage and build detection use cases for out-of-the-box detection rules. You will be responsible for organizing detection rules into carefully designed use cases (e.g., with alert types, TTP mappings, informative alert descriptions, etc.) that help Stellar Cyberâ€™s customers to understand and work on the rule-triggered alerts effectively.
