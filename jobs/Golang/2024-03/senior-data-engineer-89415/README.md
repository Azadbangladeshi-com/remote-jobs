AgentSync is built on Salesforce and AWS, effectively leveraging every aspect of those platforms and pushing the edges of what is possible within their ecosystems. We treasure stability, scalability, and customer experience as first-order principles, striving to create thoughtful, delightful user interfaces and seamless workflows. Behind the scenes, we build secure, scaled integrations into licensing database sources of truth (e.g. NIPR, FINRA), obscuring the complexity of licensing data through translation into an understandable, reportable data model.

As a Senior Data Engineer on a small team, you will design, build, and maintain high-performance, scalable, secure applications that provide the data to power AgentSync‚Äôs products. You‚Äôll be a thought partner and innovation driver, participating in the overall design of new services that tie together AgentSync‚Äôs products and systems.

**What you‚Äôll do:**

  * Write and maintain Python code, lightweight golang services, and dbt projects
  * Design, build and maintain production data pipelines to ensure data quality, efficient processing, and timely delivery of accurate and trusted data
  * Leverage your background in data modeling, microservices, and API environments to enhance data usage and ingestion
  * Solve our most challenging data integration problems utilizing optimal ETL/ELT patterns
  * Identify the right technologies for a job and working through implementation if necessary (e.g. Airflow, Kafka, Spark, Python)
  * Build and maintain best-in-class, scalable mission critical services that are consumed by both external customers and internal services
  * Identify, design, and implement ways to improve the team's productivity and efficiency by expanding on our existing tools and processes
  * Advocate for code quality by writing thorough tests, conducting code reviews, creating robust documentation and evangelizing development best practices to the team
  * Collaborate to design and build application infrastructure (we use Terraform and AWS)
  * Bring innovative ideas and new technologies to the table when working through challenging problems

**Your experience:**

  * Advanced experience with Python and SQL (dbt is a plus!)
  * Advanced experience with manipulating large structured and semi-structured datasets
  * A proven track record of implementing complex data extraction solutions (ETL/ELT)
  * Experience working with an AWS architecture to develop and maintain data pipelines
  * Experience with querying and designing database systems
  * Experience with code reviews, troubleshooting, testing, and CI/CD
  * Experience with infrastructure tools such as Terraform
  * A desire to understand both technical and business challenges, working on a multitude of different data sources and use cases
  * A strong track record of problem solving and a ‚Äúroll up your sleeves‚Äù mentality

_We encourage you to apply even if you don‚Äôt meet every requirement listed here._ _We know that every person has unique strengths, and we focus on hiring for those strengths, rather than looking for someone who meets every bullet point listed._

**About us:**
