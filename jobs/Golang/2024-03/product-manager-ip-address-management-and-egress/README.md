####  **About the Department**

As a Product Manager at Cloudflare, you are responsible for building products that improve the way that the Internet works. Product Managers at Cloudflare sit at the intersection of software development, design, and business strategy. We shape high-level product goals but also get our hands dirty. On an average day, you might pitch a concept to senior leadership, create a launch plan with marketing, work with designers to conduct user research, prototype a new feature, iterate on a spec, analyze usage data, and pair with an engineer on implementation. We have ultimate responsibility for understanding our client needs, influencing business strategy, feature specification, and working with engineering to develop our software.

####  **About the Role**

We are hiring a PM to help build products that make companies love their corporate network.

Cloudflare provides a full stack of networking-as-a-service products that allow customers to build and operate secure, reliable, and fast networks without purchasing traditional network hardware. Cloudflareâ€™s network underpins mission-critical infrastructure, always-on applications, small businesses, and everything in between. Our customers rely on the performance, security, reliability, and visibility provided by our network to power their business.

Weâ€™re looking for a PM who can define the vision for the next generation of our network services products, and help own and ship major new products in this space. As Product Manager for Network Services, your job will be to:

  * Ensure customers are able to build simple (or extremely complex!) network topologies on Cloudflare and make changes quickly as their network evolves, using the tools of their choice.
  * Understand how customers think about network reliability. Understand how the Internet and networks break. Build features to make customers happy even when the Internet is sad.
  * Think through how to make a great, easy-to-use product that customers love, and drive the full product life cycle from core user needs discovery through to pricing and packaging. Ship continuous software and process improvements to support your productsâ€™ sustained growth. 

#### **What Youâ€™ll Do**

As a member of the growing team of product managers your responsibilities include:

  * Own the product vision for your area. Ensure that it aligns with the overall product and company vision.
  * Represent the customer. Be the champion and voice of customers. Build intimate, personal customer relationships. Bring the customer's voice into the creation process.
  * Manage the roadmap. Make tough tactical prioritization decisions while helping the company think long-term. Build trust with stakeholders by maintaining an understandable, accurate roadmap.
  * Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate market observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog. Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.
  * Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and other stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.
  * Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.
  * Develop new opportunities. With your finger on the pulse of the market, the customers and the engineering teams, you are uniquely positioned to bring new products to market that solve real customer problems. 

#### **Examples of desirable skills, knowledge and experience**

You are entrepreneurial-minded and thrive in a fast-paced and goal-driven environment. You have outstanding communication and collaboration skills and are able to work with a diverse group, get consensus, and drive the product forward. You are execution focused and emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details. You have several years of experience working with enterprise, SaaS, or security technologies. You have a passion for building SaaS products and want to solve the problems of performance, security, and reliability of the Internet.

  * 3+ years of product management or equivalent experience with demonstrated ability to discover opportunities, and then define and deliver products.
  * Exceptional communication, presentation, organizational, and analytical skills.
  * Demonstrated ability to lead, drive consensus, and deliver in a matrix organization with multiple stakeholders.
  * Must be able to define and manage complex process and/or product issues of a broad scope using independent judgment.
  * Experience balancing execution, agility, and culture at a fast growing business.
  * Strong technical abilities. You are intimately familiar with modern software development practices used to build and deploy applications and data systems. You've preferably been working full time on a software delivery team.

  * Experience working with data analysis at scale. An understanding of how to make big data small.

####  **Bonus Points**

  * Scripting/programming experience (Python, Go, etc.) and familiarity with data analysis tools (eg SQL, pandas).
  * Theoretical and practical knowledge of how the Internet works at layers 1 through 7.
  * Experience in building or operating large-scale IP networks. Specific expertise in BGP and DNS a plus.
  * Hands-on experience with tools used for interacting with, debugging, and testing networks and applications (e.g. curl, dig, mtr, iperf, Wireshark, etc.)
  * Ability to validate early ideas through quantitative and qualitative methods (A/B and multivariate testing, user testing, etc).

### What Makes Cloudflare Special?

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

 **Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
