###  __Description

Thought Machine‚Äôs mission is bold - to properly and permanently rid the world‚Äôs banks of legacy technology. To achieve this, we have developed the foundations of modern banking through core and payments technology which run natively in the cloud. What we are attempting is hard and means we need great people working together to build great technology.

  

We have grown rapidly in the past few years - growing our team to more than 550 individuals across offices in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney. We have raised more than $500m in funding and are now valued at $2.7bn. Our investors include Molten Ventures, Eurazeo, Intesa Sanpaolo, Temasek, Nyca Partners, JPMorgan Chase Strategic Investments, Standard Chartered Ventures, and more.

  

We have created a culture enabling our team to produce the best work in the industry, ensuring we have fun along the way. We're regularly cited as having a fantastic workplace culture and have been recognised by Sifted magazine as having one of the highest Glassdoor ratings for a UK fintech company and the most generous employee share package in the industry. Global Finance Magazine named us one of the world‚Äôs most innovative fintechs, and the Financial Times recognised us as one of Europe‚Äôs fastest-growing companies in 2023.

  

We are currently searching for candidates to join us for a paid 10-week internship this summer. In this role, you will work in a team within our engineering department, using cutting-edge technology to deliver both client-facing and internal projects.

  

Intern projects within our engineering department can include building a card scheme simulator using Kafka and Go, adding graph validation to our workflow engine, and building a linter to validate that all API changes meet our guidelines.

  

You will develop ownership and responsibility for your own work and learn how to build software in a professional environment. Our programme will support your growth and development whilst working alongside some of the brightest minds in fintech.
