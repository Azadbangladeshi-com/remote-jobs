  * Weâ€™re building a modern microservices-based infrastructure running in multiple availability regions.

  * Building new features for our clients driven by innovation - some of these projects require super high availability and ultra low latency.

Our team**

We have 30 Engineers in the Engineering team - frontend, backend and platform. We have varied backgrounds in terms of experience, roles and responsibilities. We work closely with our product team on new features, infrastructure, growth, and client-specific work.

We nurture a learning culture, supporting growth of our engineers through clearly defined career progression paths, self-development budget as well as soft-skills training.

  
 **Our tech stack:**

Our clients interact with the Ometria platform through a single page web app, which uses the Ampersand.js framework, with a separate section in React.  
  
The app communicates with the backend platform through various Python 3 and Golang. Flask powers our Python API layer. Golang powers some of our massively concurrent workloads and analytics services.

We run on AWS/Docker/Kubernetes configured with Terraform. Data is stored in Postgres and Redshift, and we use various queueing/messaging tools (Google Pub/Sub, Kinesis, AWS SQS, Beanstalk, Celery, and Gearman)

  
 **Attributes we are looking for:**  

  *  **Experienced**

You have written software at scale in either Python or Golang or another open source language and you are looking to learn Python. You have experience with distributed systems at scale.  

  *  **Problem solver**

You enjoy working collaboratively in a team, but can also work independently to solve complex problems. You seek help/feedback when required to ensure solutions are robust, performant, secure, etcâ€¦ utilising product managers, test engineers and SREâ€™s.

  
The amazing people of Ometria are the core of our business. We believe in making it awesome to be here for all Ometrians and place a continued focus on making Ometria an inclusive, respectful and diverse environment.  
  
We're an equal opportunity employer and all applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.
