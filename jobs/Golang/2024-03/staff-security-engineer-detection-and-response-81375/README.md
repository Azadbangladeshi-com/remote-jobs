  * Experience in implementing ‚ÄúDetection as Code‚Äù
  * Experience in securing, developing detections, and responding to incidents in one major public cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  * Experience in effectively leading large and complex security incidents from detection to remediation
  * Familiarity with modern security frameworks and best practices, such as the MITRE ATT&CK framework and NIST CSF
  * Proficiency in one or more general purpose programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Go, or Rust
  * Experience with Linux administration at scale, associated intrusion/manipulation techniques, and standard methodologies for system hardening and process isolation

 **We‚Äôll be super impressed if you have experience in any of these:**
