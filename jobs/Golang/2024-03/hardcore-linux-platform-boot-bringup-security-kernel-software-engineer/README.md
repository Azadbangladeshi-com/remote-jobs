### Company Description

### About Hedgehog

Hedgehog is an open source software company dedicated to giving Cloud Native application owners the ability to deploy workloads on edge compute and distributed cloud infrastructure with the same procurement power and automated operations that power the public cloud. Hedgehog helps customers escape vendor lock, automate mass-scale infrastructure operations, and reduce their cost of service. Hedgehog is a member of the Open Compute Project, The Linux Foundation, and the SONiC community.

###  Hedgehog Values

Family

All for one and one for all! When you join Hedgehog you join a family. We are a community of friends who enjoy working together. We try really hard to understand each others values and discern whether our values are compatible. If they are, we treat each other with the love and respect we would treat a family member.

Trust

We need to know you can get the job. We need to know you have our backs. We trust that we can make each other successful. If we canâ€™t trust each other, we canâ€™t succeed.

Honesty

Transparency builds trust. We always strive to be as transparent, open and honest as possible. We arenâ€™t passive aggressive, opaque or two-faced. We say what we mean and we mean what we say. That doesnâ€™t mean that we are blunt, rude, or aggressive. It means that we are open with ourselves, our teammates, our partners and our customers. Weâ€™re in the business of open-source software after all. We should walk the walk when we talk the talk.

Fairness

Politics suck. Favoritism sucks even more. Be a good human. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Kick ass and you will be rewarded. Fail and we will help you succeed. Loose trust and we will let you know you need to have our backs.

Innovation

We take risk to join a community like Hedgehog because we want to build, market, sell and support a really great product that delivers incredible value for customers. We are in the tech business because we love the creative destruction of innovation. We love to disrupt the status quo, and we love to make people happy when they use our stuff.

Fun

Work should be fun. A lot of fun. We all want to love what we do. Life is short. Itâ€™s too short to not have fun doing what we do at least five days a week. Work can be hard at times, but we put in the effort because we feel satisfied with the results we achieve and the relationships we build. When we consistently feel that work is not fun, we introspect to understand why so we can get back to having fun again.

Care

As much as we want to make Hedgehog a family, we all obviously have actual families outside of work. Family comes first. If you need time, space or support to take care of your family and yourself, we go out of our way to give you what you need.
