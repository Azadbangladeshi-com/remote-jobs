AgentSync is built on Salesforce and AWS, effectively leveraging every aspect of those platforms and pushing the edges of what is possible within their ecosystems. We treasure stability, scalability, and customer experience as first-order principles, striving to create thoughtful, delightful user interfaces and seamless workflows. Behind the scenes, we build secure, scaled integrations into licensing database sources of truth (e.g. NIPR, FINRA), obscuring the complexity of licensing data through translation into an understandable, reportable data model.

As a Software Engineer on a small team, you will design, build, and maintain high-performance, scalable, secure applications that power AgentSync‚Äôs products. You‚Äôll be a thought partner and innovation driver, participating in the overall design of new services that tie together AgentSync‚Äôs products and systems.

**What you‚Äôll do:**

  * Identify, design, and implement ways to improve the team's productivity and efficiency by expanding on our existing tools and processes
  * Provide technical support to our external and internal customers
  * Advocate for code quality by writing thorough tests, conducting code reviews, creating robust documentation and evangelizing development best practices to the team
  * Collaborate to design and build application infrastructure (we use Terraform and AWS)
  * Bring innovative ideas and new technologies to the table when working through challenging problems

**Your experience:**

  * Experience of API architecture, design, scalability and security (Java, Go)
  * Experience or excitement about Golang experience in microservice and API environments
  * Experience building secure microservices utilizing public cloud technologies (we use AWS)
  * Experience with at least one type of database technology
  * Containerization experience (we use Docker and ECS)
  * Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (we use Terraform)
  * Experience collaborating with engineers to build scalable, performant and secure systems
  * The ability to communicate core concepts to non-technical audiences (through both verbal and written communication)
  * The desire to work on a collaborative, learning oriented team
  * A strong track record of problem solving and a ‚Äúroll up your sleeves‚Äù mentality

_We encourage you to apply even if you don‚Äôt meet every requirement listed here. We know that every person has unique strengths, and we focus on hiring for those strengths, rather than looking for someone who meets every bullet point listed._
