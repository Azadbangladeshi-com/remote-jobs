#### About the Role

Cloudflare runs one of the largest networks in the world, and the telemetry we gather from that network is broad in variety and deep in cardinality. Weâ€™re looking for a Product Manager who can help build an observability platform that enables us to get the most out of our network and provide a world-class experience for our engineers.

The Observability PM will be responsible for building a set of observability features that allow every Cloudflare engineer to build products that will delight customers from start to finish. You will transform Cloudflareâ€™s observability story to one that proactively empowers all Cloudflare products to have the insight they need in their services in order to make their services great. Youâ€™ll build services that will ensure that every Cloudflare engineer can track the health of their productâ€™s customers at every stage of the product lifecycle, and ensure that Cloudflare is shipping products of the highest quality. Youâ€™ll work with engineering teams to ensure that their requirements are being met, and with infrastructure and capacity teams to ensure that the solutions you build can scale not just to our current product and customer set, but to 10 times that or greater as Cloudflare continues our growth.

As a member of a growing team of infrastructure product managers your responsibilities include:

  * Represent the customer, be it internal or external. Be the champion and voice of customers. Build intimate, personal customer relationships. Bring the customer's voice into the creation process.
  * Develop the platform vision for your area. Ensure that your vision can work not just for your current set of customers, but for 10 or even 100 times your current set. 
  * Evangelize the vision so that all stakeholders are aligned, have context and understand where we are going.
  * Measure success. Own the measures used to define success for your product. Success measures must be defined at the inception of a product and tracked throughout its lifecycle. Make measures visible to all stakeholders and interpret them into actionable conclusions and new hypotheses.
  * Manage the roadmap. Make tough tactical prioritization decisions while helping the company think long-term. Build trust with stakeholders by maintaining an understandable, accurate roadmap.
  * Author use cases and prioritize requirements. Translate observations and customer feedback into a prioritized product backlog. Author use cases based on specific real-world product applications and extrapolate detailed product requirements for the scenarios.
  * Collaborate across teams. We win or lose as a team. Product managers play a critical role in creating alignment between engineering teams and stakeholders. A collaborative attitude is essential to the job.

You have a passion for building frameworks that scale massively and make it easy for all teams to get the most out of data as you.

  * Domain expertise in the observability space. You have been there, done that as either an architecture or product owner for observability or very closely related technology space
  * Distributed systems experience that allows you to drive the scaling strategy for observability as our scale grows both on volume and number of internal customers supporting.
  * Experience presenting new products and features to customers â€“ whether as a developer, analyst or product manager. You are enthusiastic about taking something you have helped build and sharing it with the world

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

**Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
