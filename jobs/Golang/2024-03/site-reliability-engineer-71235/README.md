Description

###  __Description

Thought Machineâ€™s mission is bold â€“ to properly and permanently rid the worldâ€™s banks of legacy technology. To achieve this, we have developed the foundations of modern banking through core and payments technology which run natively in the cloud. What we are attempting is hard and means we need great people working together to build great technology.

  

We have grown rapidly in the past few years â€“ growing our team to more than 550 individuals across offices in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney. We have raised more than $500m in funding and are now valued at $2.7bn. Our investors include Temasek, Standard Chartered Ventures, Molten Ventures, Eurazeo, Intesa Sanpaolo, Nyca Partners, JPMorgan Chase Strategic Investments, and more.

We have created a culture enabling our team to produce the best work in the industry, ensuring we have fun along the way. We're regularly cited as having a fantastic workplace culture and have been recognised by Sifted magazine as having one of the highest Glassdoor ratings for a UK fintech company and the most generous employee share package in the industry. We've been named in the IDC list of top 100 fintechs, and the Singapore HR Awards awarded us Gold and Silver for our workplace culture and employee experience.

  

We are spinning up a new regional SaaS platform team responsible for providing a world-class SaaS offering, by continuously improving and maintaining our SaaS platform. The team will be geographically distributed across our two main hubs: UK, SG.

  

Joining this team is an excellent opportunity to get exposure to how mission-critical systems are run in production. You will be part of a team that owns the system end-to-end and have a deeper understanding of exactly how our clients use the system (for example by extracting usage analytics).

  

The team will own the platform end-to-end, making use of existing infrastructure, improving core Terraform modules, as well as developing operators, tooling and additional infrastructure where appropriate. They will also be responsible for L2 support (for client-initiated support requests) and L1 (for alerting-based incidents). Support will be provided during working hours, with a follow-the-sun model and handovers happening between the 3 regions.

  

Definition and development of the SaaS roadmap is another critical responsibility of this team. Alongside the Product Management function, they will define technical requirements, features and implement them with the goal of offering an excellent SaaS experience to our clients.

  * Improving the scalability, security and performance of the SaaS platform, by implementing automated compliance and controls, testing different Kafka and DB setups (e.g. Aurora vs RDS) and running load tests at every level of the stack.
  * Implementing and regularly testing DR strategies to ensure the highest level of resilience and fault tolerance of the platform.
