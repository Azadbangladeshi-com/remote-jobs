#### **About Brave**

Brave is on a mission to protect the human right to privacy online. Weâ€™ve built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a private search engine with a _truly_ independent index, a browser-native crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you for your attention. And weâ€™re just getting started. Already 50 million people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more switch every month.

The internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge profits off our data, and tells us whatâ€™s true and whatâ€™s not. Brave is fighting back. Join us!
