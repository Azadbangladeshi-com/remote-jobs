### Who We Are

If you feel like Incident Response and Recovery hasn‚Äôt changed in the past 10 years, you‚Äôre not alone. Business operations aren‚Äôt just on endpoints anymore. It‚Äôs behind applications in Okta tiles, auto-scaling workloads, code repos, and sprawling data stores across one or many public clouds. At modePUSH, we‚Äôre focused on eradicating adversaries across our client‚Äôs entire digital footprint, and that demands a faster, nimbler approach to DFIR.

We‚Äôre looking to expand our team with individuals driven to protect clients, eliminate threat actors, and build the next era of digital forensics and incident response for the modern enterprise.

You're not just looking for a job; you're seeking a platform where you can make a significant impact, leveraging your skills in Python, Go, Azure, and DevOps practices to pave the way for more intelligent, more resilient cloud infrastructures.
