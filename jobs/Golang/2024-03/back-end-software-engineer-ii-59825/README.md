### Abnormal Security  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Singapore`  

### **About You**

### The Opportunity

In a cloud software world, who you are and what you have access to determines the risk associated with your accounts being compromised, Abnormal Security aims to build a comprehensive tool to understand the employees of our customers, and aid security professionals in assessing the risks and threats impacting their employee base. Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Securityâ€™s industry leading products do in the email security space.

**Weâ€™re looking to add a Backend Engineer to our team of world class engineers.** The individual in this role will shape and elevate our Knowledge Engines Platform team while working closely within the Behavioral Security Products division. This role straddles the line of velocity and excellence.

**As a Backend Engineer of the Knowledge Engines Platform team, you will:**

  * Build out performant APIs to serve consistent data that serve as sources of truth for many systems in abnormal
  * Establish data pipelines that ensure our data is updated regularly and reliably
  * Enhance our frameworks to allow us to make changes to our APIs and datasets in an agile manner
  * Provide operational support to maintain a high level of system uptime and performance
  * Create a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates

You are someone who wants to make an impact. You are passionate about solving customer problems and have built up a base of skills in backend and distributed systems development to do so. You want to apply those skills on a problem that leaves the world in a better place.

We are a scrappy team: we are building multiple systems from scratch - this means you should be comfortable with a level of uncertainty beyond what youâ€™d find at a more mature company or even a more mature team at Abnormal. Many of our projects will come with vague requirements across multiple teams, and we expect this engineer to be able to refine the requirements from the teams by reaching out to them to make sure we fulfill their needs.

We are also not only a remote team, but a very distributed team, as such you will need to have excellent communication skills across both verbal and written mediums. You will need to be just as comfortable on a zoom call as writing a 1 pager project proposal to be shared across the team for technical feedback.

### **Must Have Skills**

  * Experience working with building and operating distributed systems and services
  * Experience working with data pipelines, both event-driven and synchronous
  * 3-5 Years of overall software engineering experience
  * Experience with Golang, Python
  * Experience with relevant tech stack:
    * Language: Python, Golang
    * Platform: AWS
    * Framework: Spark
    * Storage / Data Pipelines: Postgres, Airflow, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Parquet

### **Nice to Have Skills**

  * 2+ years Golang
  * 2+ years Protobuf
  * 2+ years Apache Spark (mainly PySpark)

### **Role Responsibilities**

  * Build and maintain high-throughput, low-latency systems that process 100s of millions of events per day to enable detection to identify notable events
  * Enhance our frameworks for improving detection efficiency and effectiveness
  * Provide operational support to maintain a high level of system uptime and performance
  * Create a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates
