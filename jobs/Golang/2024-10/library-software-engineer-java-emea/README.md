We're on a mission to build the best platform in the world for engineers to understand and scale their systems, applications, and teams. We operate at high scaleâ€”trillions of data points per dayâ€”allowing for seamless collaboration and problem-solving among Dev, Ops and Security teams globally for tens of thousands of companies. Our engineering culture values pragmatism, honesty, and simplicity to solve hard problems the right way.

**The Team:**

Datadog Application Security Management (ASM) allows customers to manage application security risk with continuous, real-time monitoring of vulnerabilities and threats against your web applications, serverless applications, and APIs, in production. Automatically integrated with Application Performance Monitoring (APM) distributed tracing and code-level context, Application Security Management empowers development, operations, and security teams to build and run secure applications in production.

_At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them._

**The Opportunity:**

We are looking for a software engineer to work on our open-source Java library . On top of working on the daily life of this open-source project, it includes working on integrations (HTTP, GraphQL, gRPC...) and security monitoring features such as attack attempts or vulnerability detection. Come and join us to build amazing open-source software!

**What Youâ€™ll Do:**

  * Develop primarily in Java, and to some extent Groovy, Python, and C.

  * Work closely with the other six Security Libraries teams through working groups and RFCs.
  * Collaborate with the Security platform teams to make new product ideas happen.
  * Ensure that your quality criteria are met thanks to our shared testing platform, health metrics, performance monitoring metrics, etc.

**Who You Are:**

  * You are an experienced Java developer.
  * You have experience with multiple web frameworks (e.g. Spring, Play, Akka-HTTP, Vert.x).
  * You are familiar with JVM ins and outs (GC, JIT, bytecode, etc).
  * Youâ€™ve written piles of clean, correct, well-tested, performant, idiomatic Java code.
  * You care about performance and have experience in measuring and optimizing code.
  * You care about quality and maintain a strong testing discipline.
  * You want to work in a fast, high growth startup environment.

_Datadog values people from all walks of life. We understand not everyone will meet all the above qualifications on day one. That's okay. If youâ€™re passionate about technology and want to grow your skills, we encourage you to apply._

**Bonus Points:**

  * You know another language that runs on the JVM, like Kotlin, Scala, or Clojure.
  * You have experience with C.
  * You have experience with JNI.
  * You have written a Java Agent before.
  * You have experience with byte-buddy, asm or other JVM instrumentation libraries.
  * You have experience with other JVM runtimes, such as J9 or GraalVM.
  * You have some familiarity with OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, or know the basics of how a SQL Injection or XSS attack works.

**Benefits and Growth:**

  * New hire stock equity (RSUs) and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)
  * Continuous professional development, product training, and career pathing
  * Intradepartmental mentor and buddy program for in-house networking
