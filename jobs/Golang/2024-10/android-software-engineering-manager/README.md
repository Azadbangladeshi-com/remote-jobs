**Philo: TV on the Internet!!!**

At Philo, weâ€™re a group of technology and product people who set out to build the future of television, marrying the best in modern technology with the most compelling medium ever invented â€” in short, weâ€™re building the TV experience that weâ€™ve always wanted for ourselves. In practice this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences.

### **Android Software Engineering Manager**

The Android team at Philo is responsible for building our product experience on four different platforms from one codebase â€” Android Mobile, Android TV, Amazon Fire Tablets, and Amazon FireTV. Weâ€™re a small collaborative team building apps with high engagement and millions of installs, which collectively are responsible for a huge fraction of the billions of minutes watched on Philo each year. We are passionate about crafting the best possible UX to connect our users with the content they love, providing a seamless viewing experience while surprising them with new features and capabilities.

Engineering Managers at Philo lead by example, and are expected to write code and demonstrate best practices while also providing coaching, technical leadership, and insights within and across teams. We expect managers to split their time between hands-on technical project tasks (coding, designing, scoping, researching, etc.), and on team management and coaching, adjusting the ratio as needed depending on the team's needs at any given time. We are seeking an enthusiastic Software Engineering Manager with a deep technical background building high-quality, high-engagement Android applications for TV and mobile. As a member of a growing team, you will serve as both a technical leader to help us build new features and as an internal subject matter expert on the Android platform.

#### **Responsibilities:**

  * Provide technical leadership to members of the Android team, including input on system architecture and design tradeoffs.
  * Provide strong people management for the members of your team, including technical coaching, high quality feedback on performance, and career development.
  * Drive continuous improvements to the reliability, performance, and UI of the Android applications. In practice this means managing our tech debt backlog, and advocating for improvements as needed.
  * Manage day-to-day partnership operations with Google and Amazon. This includes working through technical integrations and ensuring that the app release process goes smoothly.
  * Help the team manage and plan for the application releases. We have a rotating release shepherd, who is a member of the Android team and is responsible for the nuts and bolts coordination of each release (every 2 weeks). In this role you would help guide the shepherd and make hard decisions about feature inclusion.
  * Monitor app performance and triage crashes, bugs and performance regressions as they arise.
  * Collaborate with internal stakeholders across marketing, support, design, product, and data science teams to ensure smooth feature delivery.
  * Own the best practices within the codebase; lead by example by improving the codebase and its supporting documentation as you go.
  * Own and drive any hiring/recruiting needed for the growth of the team over time.

**Qualifications:**

  * 8+ years of software development experience
  * 3+ years of software engineering management experience
  * Experience with Kotlin, Coroutines, and their surrounding ecosystem
  * Experience developing an Android app for TV platforms
  * Experience with Jetpack Compose
  * Experience with MVVM, MVI, and/or Clean Architecture
  * Experience using SQL-based tools for application monitoring and alerting

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience with video playback and ExoPlayer
  * Experience with GraphQL-based APIs
  * Experience with TV Integration Framework
  * Experience with cross device interoperability (e.g. casting)
  * Experience building multi-modal experiences

The Android codebase uses MVI paradigms, and we are slowly adding Compose to our larger components. Of particular note, our business logic is largely encapsulated by a shared Kotlin Multiplatform Codebase, so for newer features, the business logic lives outside of the Android code.
