### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

The Payments organization owns some of Stripeâ€™s most critical payment flows and a platform that processes hundreds of billions of dollars in payments a year. Our team builds and scales the infrastructure and financial partner integrations that enables Stripe to accept, manage, and payout money across many countries, currencies, and payment methods.

Our work is core to Stripeâ€™s business, and thousands of developers use our platform and infrastructure to create valuable products and services that billions of people use. Our goal is to increase the GDP of the internet by making it easy to build global products, services, and platforms that handle money.  
Technical Operations roles in Payments are a dynamic and key component of Stripe's success. Focused on financial partner integrations and funds flow expansion, we sit at the intersection of product/platform engineers and financial partners, connecting them to ensure that everyone thrives and nothing is lost in translation.

Our team partners closely with various finance and infrastructure engineering teams to ensure timely delivery of accurate data between financial partners, internal stakeholders, and Stripe leaders. We report and trace all of Stripeâ€™s money movement transactions, including payments in more than 30 currencies and dozens of countries. Youâ€™ll own building and scaling Stripeâ€™s manual and programmatic financial reporting and reconciliation processes for intra-company and outgoing money movement transactions.

## **What youâ€™ll do**

### **Responsibilities**

  * Technical Operations roles are one part coding and one part managing projects. The ideal candidate will have experience in both, but successful candidates may index more highly in one or the other.
  * Organize and direct complex technical changes as part of product releases and merchant migrations
  * Identify and automate inefficient or unnecessary manual processes by making direct code changes, or coordinating more complex code changes across Stripe
  * Handle inquiries from internal Stripes and external partners' technical teams with detailed investigation and sometimes code changes
  * Design alerting systems using existing tools to respond to incidents quickly, or prevent them altogether
  * Conduct data analysis to understand the impact of merchant configurations for Radar, and surface future product opportunities

## **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply.

  * Knowledge of and experience with payment technologies and ecosystems
  * Ability to write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby and Java. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general coding skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework
  * Comfort using SQL to navigate Stripe's data and diagnose the scope and urgency of issues
  * Comfort with developer tools (e.g. git), and an ability to make well-scoped code changes in Stripe's codebase
  * Adaptable and self-starting, demonstrating an ability to tackle complex, undefined problems and develop effective solutions in a self-directed manner
  * Great technical problem-solving skills, with an ability to develop a working understanding of a technical system using a variety of methods. These include (but aren't limited to): reading/writing code, reading documentation or partner specifications, running debugging programs, reading logs, asking well-formed questions to domain experts, or digging into the raw data through various interfaces.
  * Great communication skills, with an ability to frame messages appropriately for technical and non-technical audiences
  * The will to deliver results, with an ability to establish priorities and reliably execute on solutions (often with hard external deadlines)
  * An instinct to produce work that increases the impact of others, and helps us scale and grow (e.g. documentation, tools)
