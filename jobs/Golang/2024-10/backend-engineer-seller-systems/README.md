## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

The Seller Systems team owns several systems and processes that support the sales process at Stripe including opportunity management, pricing, contract, onboarding, and realization. We are looking for people with a strong background or interest in working across these domains to build successful platforms and systems. Youâ€™re comfortable dealing with many moving pieces, you work effectively across teams and functions, and you have exquisite attention to detail. Youâ€™re looking forward to learning new technologies, systems, and problem domains. If this resonates with you, do apply!

### **What you'll do**

As a backend engineer, you will design and build platforms, tooling, and system solutions that are configurable and scalable around the globe. You will partner with many functions at Stripe, with the opportunity to both work on infrastructure/platform systems, as well as produce direct user-facing business impact.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Design APIs and data models that facilitate complex system integrations
  * Design, build and maintain large-scale production services and data pipelines
  * Work on systems critical to Stripeâ€™s current and future operation, with responsibility for billions of dollars of payments volume
  * Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
  * Collaborate with stakeholders across the company including engineering, product, operations, finance, data science, accounting, sales, and operations.
  * Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes

## **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * 5+ years of experience in data modeling, API design, distributed systems and data pipeline development.
  * Love to design systems that are elegant abstractions over complex patterns/practices.
  * Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems.
  * Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
  * Think about systems, services, and platforms, and write high quality code. We work mostly in Java, Scala, and Ruby.
  * However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
  * Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.
  * Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise.

### **Preferred Requirements**

  * Familiarity with Salesforce data models and best practices for integrating Salesforce with other systems
  * Understanding of security best practices in cloud environments, particularly in managing authentication and authorization between systems.
