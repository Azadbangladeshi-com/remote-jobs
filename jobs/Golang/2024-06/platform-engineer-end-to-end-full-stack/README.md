# [Platform Engineer - End-to-End / Full Stack](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/platform-engineer-end-to-end-full-stack)  
### Camect  
#### `ðŸŒŽ San Jose, California, United States`  

### **Description**

Camect is looking for a software and systems engineer who loves to work end-to-end on a complete system (hardware+software+cloud platform) rather than being pigeon-holed into a much smaller problem space at a large company. If that's you, join our excellent team to work with the founders of one of the most advanced AI security camera system architectures on the market -- and get to touch all the technology that makes the platform tick.

This position will be a Senior Platform Engineer position for candidates with the appropriate skills and experience, but could also be appropriate for a recent computer science grad with a strong interest in software systems and in running production services, as demonstrated through coursework, hobbies, internships, etc.

We're looking for a team player with a good background in computer systems and software who also has a love for tinkering with, debugging and understanding devices and applications. If you are driven to really understand the nitty gritty details of how things work, we would love to talk to you.

In this position, you'll be figuring out systems problems and solutions at all levels -- starting at a low level where a little knowledge of the hardware and OS (linux) installation is handy, working up through the linux OS configuration, the networking and network administration, the containerization (docker), up to the deployment of cloud VMs and configuration and management of a highly reliable cloud service. Youâ€™ll manage VMs in the cloud and help to troubleshoot physical devices in the wild. Youâ€™ll plan and execute the evolution of the systems framework that supports Camectâ€™s suite of products. Youâ€™ll evaluate new hardware devices and figure out how to deal with all the quirks you encounter.

**Who you are:**

By night, you love to tinker with, hack on, and explore devices and software systems, especially systems based on linux. By day, you know what it takes to responsibly manage a fleet of systems for your customers.

You love being on the cutting edge, but balance that desire against the risks and care needed to make changes to production systems. Your primary focus isnâ€™t to write application code, but you can be a good software engineer when you need to. Instead, you find it more fun to understand and run complete system stacks end to end where you see the impact your work has on your users. You can read code to see how things work, or fix it.

Youâ€™re aware you may not know everything required to do this job on day 1 â€“ but youâ€™re confident in your ability to dive in and chase down any system or operational problem wherever it takes you. Youâ€™re not afraid of complex software, and you love being resourceful and independently figuring things out in the face of a challenge.

###  **Requirements**

 **Minimum qualifications:**

  * 2+ years experience installing, configuring, and adminâ€™ing Linux systems.
  * 1+ year of software engineering experience.
  * 1+ year experience in a position of responsibility for managing, updating, and troubleshooting a production cluster or fleet of devices composed of at least 50 Linux systems with real users
  * Mastery of at least 1 high-level systems programming language (golang, C++, C)
  * Mastery of at least 1 scripting language (bash strongly preferred)
  * Ability to delve into a large, well-written code base to learn how things work.
  * An understanding of TCP/IP network configuration and what firewalls do
  * A basic idea of what a container system like Docker does
  * Experience with at least one cloud platform (e.g. AWS, or Google Cloud)
  * Evidence to demonstrate a love of tinkering or creative modification. Have you ever contributed to an open-source project? Do you have any devices you hacked in some way? 

**Desirable qualifications:**

If you happen to own any security cameras and/or have an interest in home security and surveillance, that's a very nice plus.

Some of the items below would also be nice to have, but all systems building, debugging and tinkering experience will be considered:

  * 5+ years of work experience involving systems engineering, systems programming, system administration, system reliability, or devops for linux systems or networks
  * A good understanding of network and service architectures, including HTTP, DNS, load balancing, traffic sniffing, VPNs, etc and troubleshooting systems that use them. 
  * Experience setting up and running an application on a network of VMs on any cloud platform
  * A strong awareness of network security considerations.
  * Very high comfort level with the use of ssh/sshd and port forwarding.
  * Experience with docker, and either docker swarm or kubernetes.
  * Experience building and installing linux kernels, including changing kernel configuration flags, updating initrd, and blacklisting modules. 
  * Experience as an SRE at a tech company that supports a large number of devices and users. 
  * Experience in a startup or other job situation where being independent, scrappy and resourceful was key to your success. 

### **Benefits**

 **Our competitive compensation package includes:**

  * Competitive Salary + Equity Package
  * Health, Dental & Vision Medical Plans
  * Tremendous autonomy to set the direction of your work and have a large impact
  * Fantastic company culture where you are appreciated for your contributions. 

**About Camect:**

Camect is a fast-moving early-stage venture-funded startup that drastically increases the value that home and small business owners derive from their security cameras. We change the game from finding out that a crime happened to providing a real chance of preventing the crime or catching the perpetrator. We produce way better alerts that really show users (only) what is worth knowing about. We have a focus on user privacy well beyond that of others in the business. Add support for most camera brands, and the ability to connect to professional video monitoring, and we have a very unique product.

We can justifiably brag about having the best-available AI in this space, and it's fully local on our affordable device - while most alternatives force you to give up control over your data and become dependent on a cloud service. We've already delivered our product to many happy users, both commercial and residential, and we are growing as we reach more and more monitored security users.
