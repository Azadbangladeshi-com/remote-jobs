## Description

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best developer tools for AI developers. Weights & Biases is a series C company with $250 million in funding and a rapidly growing user base. Our platform is an essential piece of the daily work for machine learning engineers, from academic research institutions like FAIR and UC Berkeley to massive enterprise teams including iRobot, OpenAI, Toyota Research Institute, Samsung, NVIDIA, Salesforce, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Lyft, and more.

  

As the software engineer in charge of Weights & Biases Sweeps product, you‚Äôll build and maintain key features to allow users to effectively tune hyperparameters. You‚Äôll work on the next generation of sweeps, with a focus on allowing users to effectively distribute their hyperparameter tuning scripts across clusters and cloud infrastructure. You‚Äôll also contribute to the development of Weights & Biases Launch, an execution layer being actively developed on the Weights & Biases platform. You will have the opportunity to design system architecture and APIs so users can easily send their workflows to the cloud, or local clusters.
