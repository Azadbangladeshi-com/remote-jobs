AssemblyAI is an industry-leading Speech AI provider, with models that consistently rank first in benchmark reports, tens of thousands of developers building on our API, and over $115 million in venture capital funding from top VCs. Weâ€™re looking for a Head of Developer Relations and Experience to grow AssemblyAIâ€™s builder community and ensure developers find and build with AssemblyAI.

This is a critical leadership role that will help AssemblyAI continue to build a strong community of builders and establish ourselves as a leader in the AI space.

Collaborate closely with our engineering team on the overall roadmap for SDKs and integrations, ongoing updates and maintenance of those entities, and tracking overall usage and success 
  * Have a strong POV on which conferences and events are worth participating in, present on behalf of AssemblyAI to engage with the developer community, and determine our plans for future hackathons and developer experiences 
  * Identify developer needs and current gaps in our signup, activation, and overall usage experience and partner with product, engineering, and marketing teams to make an exceptional developer experience. Continue to improve the experience by partnering closely with product and PMM to bring new products to market
  * Be a strong voice on our GTM leadership and overall senior leadership teams to ensure that the entire company is successful and teams are focused on the right activities, work is aligned across the organization, and we can scale the organization effectively 

## **What Youâ€™ll Need:**

  * A point of view on what great Developer Relations looks like, how itâ€™s contributes to a companyâ€™s growth and key business metrics, and how to demonstrate the value of the hard-to-measure but critical work that the team does
