### Utility Warehouse  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote,London, United Kingdom`  

### **Company Description**

 **Hi! We're UW.**

Weâ€™re on a mission to take the headache out of utilities by providing them all in one place. One bill for energy, broadband, mobile and insurance and a whole lot of savings!

Weâ€™re aiming to double in size as we help more people to stop wasting time and money. Big ambitions, to be delivered by people like you.

Got your attention? Read onâ€¦

**The challenge**

For our customers and Partners, UW just needs to work â€“ there when you need it, and invisible when you donâ€™t. Just like flicking a switch.  
  
Our proposition to customers is simple, but for our technology teams, the behind-the-scenes complexity is what makes it so interesting. Learn more about life in our Tech teams here.

**We put people first. Itâ€™s all about you..**

We are in search of individual who possesses the ability to maintain, enhance, and deploy changes to our existing quoting application and backend APIs. This role will primarily involve using **React & React Native** with **TypeScript** on the frontend and **GraphQL** & **Go** on the backend.

The engineering team at UW is known for its high visibility, consumer-facing projects, and delivery-oriented approach. You must thrive in a fast-paced environment and embrace continuous iteration, all while navigating a regulatory ecosystem.

Attention to detail is crucial, but so is the ability to devise pragmatic, commercially viable, and customer-centric solutions. Ego has no place here; collaboration is the foundation of our work culture, and we operate as a tightly-knit unit. Emotional intelligence and self-awareness are valued traits.

A strong drive for learning and personal growth is essential, along with a genuine desire to support and mentor junior engineers.

**We work together. Your team and the people you will work withâ€¦**

We work in small, fully autonomous teams that have real ownership of their products. We use the best tool for the job and constantly look for better.

The Partner Sales Tooling team owns the mobile app and web solutions as well as the backend services that enable our network of partners to identify, manage, help and convert new customers.

Our Partner network and these tools play a pivotal role in the success and expansion of our business. They serve as the primary drivers of growth, making the tools we develop, nurture, and enhance absolutely essential to our operations.

The Partner Sales Tool team is part of the Growth group â€“ which is responsible for all engineering development related to customer growth â€“ within UWâ€™s engineering department.

As a member of the team you will collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including UI/UX designers, product owners, and other software engineers.

**We deliver progress. What youâ€™ll do and how you will make an impact.**

Youâ€™ll play a big part in the implementation of a new quoting application which will ultimately replace the existing web app responsible for our signup journey.

Ensuring a high standard of quality in both code and feature deployment is paramount in this role.

A successful candidate would be able to lead their own projects, guide workflows of the team, and initiate improvement projects based on the product or technology. We want all members of the team to be actively contributing to the product and work undertaken by the team.

**So why pick UW?**

Weâ€™ve got big ambitions so thereâ€™s going to be plenty of challenges. There are also a lot of benefits:

  * An industry benchmarked salary. Weâ€™ll share it during your first conversation.

  * Share Options and a Save as You Earn scheme.

  * Fully remote working.

  * Discount on our services and you get our coveted Cashback Card for free. 

  * A matched contribution pension scheme and life assurance up to 4x your salary.

  * Family-friendly policies, designed to help you and your family thrive.

  * Discounted private health insurance, access to an Employee Assistance line and a free Virtual GP.

  * Belonging groups that help UW shape an even more inclusive future.

  * A commitment to helping you develop and grow in your role.
