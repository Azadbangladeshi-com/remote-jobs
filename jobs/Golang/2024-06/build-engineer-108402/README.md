### **Description**

 **Who we are**

Born in 2014, Yoti is a digital identity and biometric technology company that makes it safer for people to prove who they are. The Yoti app was designed with privacy at its core, giving people a secure way to prove their identity and share third-party credentials with organisations and other people.

Today, we have over ten million app downloads around the world. Weâ€™ve expanded our offering to a suite of business solutions that span identity verification, age verification and estimation, e-signing, AI anti-spoofing technologies and we continue to think of innovative new offerings.

From day one, weâ€™ve been working to fix an outdated identity system. This is not a journey we make on our own but with policy advisors, think tanks, researchers, academics, humanitarian bodies, our users and everyday people. We are committed to solving identity problems through grassroots research and social purpose initiatives.
