Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead.

### **About the team**

As a platform company powering businesses all over the world, Stripe processes payments, runs marketplaces, and detects fraud, helping entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world. User Billing provides a central entry point for Stripe teams to monetize products in global markets. We build platforms and services to define and manage pricing, calculate and collect Stripeâ€™s revenue, and empower Stripe and our users to understand and manage revenue and costs. We work on customer-facing experiences, internal platforms, and data pipelines to empower Accounting, Finance, Strategy, Sales, and Stripeâ€™s Products to drive business value across the entire user and product lifecycle.

User Billing is a core engine powering many of Stripeâ€™s biggest bets, from shipping new products faster to redefining our commercial strategy. The right technical leadership will allow us to scale faster and more reliably as our business accelerates. If that sounds exciting, weâ€™d love to speak with you.
