**POSITION SUMMARY**

EarnIn is seeking a Staff Application Framework Software Engineer (SWE) to develop a unified framework supporting microservice and API developers across different language runtimes. This role aims to improve efficiencies and reduce complexities in our current development processes by focusing initially on Kotlin using Spring Framework and C# using .NET Framework. As a senior engineering team member, you play a crucial role in driving technical excellence and shaping architectural decisions. You will architect, maintain, and optimize frameworks and libraries for eventing, identity, rate limiting and logging to name a few. This role will provide backend engineers with the tools and guidance they need to design and implement high-quality software systems and work to grow the overall strength of our organization.

The base salary range for this full-time position is $206,600 - $308,000 + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. We would like to hire this role as a hybrid in our Palo Alto HQ but are open to remote for the right candidate.

**WHAT YOU'LL DO**

  * Lead the effort to build standards into reusable and shared components, significantly improving the developer experience. Establish and enforce development practices, standards, and guidelines to ensure consistency and quality across the team.
  * Drive architecture design reviews, ensuring adherence to best practices and high standards of software development. Partner with cross-functional teams, including Backend and ML developers, and L0 architects, to develop robust frameworks that improve developer productivity.
  * Assess and build cutting-edge technologies, tools, and frameworks to enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of our software systems.
  * Lead the migration from a Kotlin monolith to a microservice oriented architecture and/or serverless, event-based architecture, ensuring a seamless and efficient transition while optimizing system performance and scalability.
  * Influence processes that ensure all teams are delivering high-quality software in a consistent fashion, without restricting creativity.
  * Continuously evaluate software systems to identify potential issues or areas for improvement and proactively address them. Your insights will help us build resilient and efficient systems.

**WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR**

  * Masterâ€™s or PhD in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related field.
  * 7+ years in software development with architectural leadership, significant experience in Java (Kotlin), Python, and TypeScript.
  * Proficiency in RDBMS (Postgres/MySQL), document databases, key-value stores, Elasticsearch, AWS managed services (Lambd) and application monitoring and performance tuning.
  * Ability to develop a unified framework that addresses the complexities and inefficiencies in current development processes.
  * Experience in leading projects and collaborating with various teams to ensure the successful implementation of framework solutions.
  * Strong communication skills to articulate the benefits and functionalities of the framework to stakeholders.
