# **The Company**

Bigeye is on a mission to help enterprises trust their data. When used effectively, data can create magical experiences in services and products we all use every day. But those experiences suffer whenever data is delayed, missing, or low quality. Nearly every major enterprise still struggles to keep their data pipelines reliable and to maintain data quality, and can no longer afford to sift through a mess of manually created data quality rules.

Some of the worldâ€™s largest enterprisesâ€”like Centene, Kenvue, and Williams-Sonomaâ€”have realized they need a more scalable approach, and now use Bigeyeâ€™s industry-leading data observability platform to keep their mission critical data applications running smoothly. Our unmatched support for enterprise-oriented data sources, and industry-leading data lineage capabilities, give us a unique foundation from which to serve enterprise data teams.

The scale of this challenge is incredibly exciting: we already check over 2 million data quality attributes every day for our customers, but estimate that only 2% of the addressable market has made the switch to using data observability.

Come join us in the journey to serve the other 98%.

## The Work

Today, weâ€™re focused on the most impactful aspects of DataOps: observability and lineage.

Most teams still discover data outages â€“ duplicated, missing, and unexpected data â€“ after they impact application features, dashboards, ML models, and ultimately their stakeholders.
