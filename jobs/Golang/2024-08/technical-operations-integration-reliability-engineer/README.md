## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

Connect builds infrastructure for the worldâ€™s leading platforms and marketplaces to incorporate payments into their products. Connect has been at the forefront of Stripeâ€™s growth due to the power of its offering, which enables our users to distribute Stripeâ€™s payment processing directly to their sellers and merchants. As Stripe grows its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Connect will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe by enabling our platforms to distribute all of Stripeâ€™s products to their end users.

Tax Reporting Product builds tax products and services for the worldâ€™s leading businesses to remain compliant with the tax authorities and to solve their tax complexities so that they can operate and grow globally using Stripeâ€™s network. Our mission is to enable businesses and Stripe to fulfill their tax reporting needs, simply. Weâ€™re solving a very hard problem of stitching together the monetary flows and reporting obligations between an expansive collection of merchants, marketplaces, financial institutions and government regulators. Our new product distills the complex rules of tax into a platform with streamlined experiences that make tax filings easy and accurate. We are also one of the top emerging SaaS product offerings within Stripe and are enabling the companyâ€™s growth beyond core payments.

## **What youâ€™ll do**

### **Responsibilities**

  * Become a domain expert in the area of Connect Tax Reporting products 
  * Handle end-to-end workflows to support tax reporting needs for platforms and marketplaces.
  * Handle inquiries from internal Stripes and external partners' technical teams, often requiring detailed investigation and sometimes code changes
  * Engage with Stripe's financial partners to drive alignment on product usage, troubleshoot and solve technical problems or breakages 
  * Organize and direct complex technical changes and projects between Stripe and our partners
  * Identify and automate inefficient or unnecessary manual processes through code changes, partner agreements, or making and coordinating more complex code changes across Stripe
  * Design future anomaly detection systems and tools to ensure that data flowing through our partner and internal systems is reliable and correct
  * Collaborate across the company, including engineering, accounting, financial partnerships and product, to trace and account for billions of dollars moving through the Stripe platform

## **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Technical Operations roles are one part coding and one part managing projects. The ideal candidate will have experience in both, but successful candidates may index more highly in one or the other. We work mostly in Ruby and Java. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general coding skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * 6+ years of work experience (excluding tenure from internships)
  * Ability to write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby and Java. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general coding skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework
  * Comfort using SQL to navigate Stripe's data and diagnose the scope and urgency of issues
  * Experience with developer tools (e.g. git), and an ability to make well-scoped code changes in Stripe's codebase
  * Technical problem-solving skills, with an ability to develop a working understanding of a technical system using a variety of methods. These include (but aren't limited to): reading/writing code, reading documentation or partner specifications, running debugging programs, reading logs, asking well-formed questions to domain experts, or digging into the raw data through various interfaces.
  * Solid communication skills, with an ability to frame messages appropriately for technical and non-technical audiences

### **Preferred qualifications**

  *     * The will to deliver results, with an ability to establish priorities and reliably execute on solutions (often with hard external deadlines)
    * An instinct to produce work that increases the impact of others, and helps us scale and grow (e.g. documentation, tools)
