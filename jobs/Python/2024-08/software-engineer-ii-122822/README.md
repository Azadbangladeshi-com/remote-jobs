We limit meetings, so you can focus on getting things done. New developers to the team typically deploy their first production code on their first day.

We value teamwork. Product doesnâ€™t write a spec and throw it over the wall - we are true partners in creating impact. Our engineers are flexible. Weâ€™re not talking about hot yoga here. Weâ€™re a rapidly scaling startup. Things are going to change. The code we wrote last sprint, may no longer be the right path forward and thatâ€™s ok.

  * Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field (Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering) is a requirement; Master's degree preferred
  * 7+ years of software engineering experience
  * Confidence working in different parts of the stack - we are full stack engineers â€“ but a strong primary focus on Front End technologies
  * Familiarity with modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Vue, React, Angular)
  * Experience with Django or Flask
  * A sense of urgency
  * Ability to make technical trade-offs, considering both the technical and the business needs, with the ultimate objective of delivering quality code and products
  * Communication is key; our work is heavily team-oriented, and we are looking for someone who is comfortable participating and contributing to the team
  * A passion for mentoring and coaching more junior team members
  * Enthusiasm for adapting to the changing needs of the business
  * Excitement about startups and working with a small Agile team; start up experience a plus

We are looking for awesome people to join a growing and fun team. We aim to create an environment that is open and transparent, collaborative, supportive, and diverse. We are looking for engineers who want to learn about the latest technologies to craft scalable and maintainable code. The problems we are solving are challenging and interesting and we want your help.
