Datadogâ€™s Staff Engineers are our technical leaders operating at the forefront of technology, building solutions that take us through at least our next five years of growth. They do this in three major ways:

As individual contributors, they bring world-class technical abilities to deliver industry-leading systems in areas such as data visualization, virtual runtime profiling, and planet-scale streaming.As technical leaders, they bring experienced technical breadth and communication skills to tackle design and architectural problems spanning the organization, charting the right course, and then leading delivery.  
  
In both roles, they participate in the staff engineering community and help us learn from what the industry is doing and what we've built before, and so improving company-wide standards around software and systems engineering.  
  
Examples of projects you might take on as a staff engineer include designing and implementing a major improvement to a system or tool that many application engineering teams depend on, developing a new Datadog product line from initial outline to public launch (and beyond), or breaking down a complex UX problem, solving the fundamental workflows, and polishing your solution until it feels intuitive.

_At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them.
