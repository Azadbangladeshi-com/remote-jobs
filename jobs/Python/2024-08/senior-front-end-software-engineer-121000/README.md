Agile Six is a people-first, remote-work company that serves shoulder-to-shoulder with federal agencies to find innovative, human-centered solutions. We build better by putting people first. We are animated by our core values of Purpose, Wholeness, Trust, Self-Management and Inclusion. We deliver our solutions in autonomous teams of self-managed professionals (no managers here!) who genuinely care about each other and the work. We know that‚Äôs our company‚Äôs purpose ‚Äì and that we can only achieve it by supporting a culture where people feel valued, self-managed, and love to come to work.

Agile Six is looking for a **Senior** **Front-End Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in React.js to join a highly collaborative team working with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Our team is seeking someone interested in and capable of working across the tech stack, using both front and back end languages and frameworks; experience with Ruby on Rails is a plus. Our ideal candidate is patient, curious, proactive, and positive; someone who understands the large impact that even small changes can have on end users, someone able to learn a complex landscape and innovate, someone who constantly seizes opportunities to refine, and someone who is dedicated to accessibility and championing the impact our work has on veterans. Most importantly, we are looking for someone with a passion for working on important problems that have a lasting impact on millions of users and make a difference in our government.

This team is partnering with the Department of VA to help expedite the delivery of benefits to Veterans. This groundbreaking work will be instrumental to ensuring that over 3.5 million impacted Veterans receive care for conditions related to their military service.
