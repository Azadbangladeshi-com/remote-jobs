### Descript  
#### `ðŸ’° 390000.0` `ðŸŒŽ Canada,United States`  

Our vision is to build the next generation platform to enable easy and fast creation of audio and video content powered by cutting-edge AI. Building a revolutionary way to record, transcribe, edit and mix spoken audio and video comes with a series of unique challenges and requires solving hard and complex problems. Learn more about how we're building Descript from one of our Engineers.

Platform engineers are our human to metal interface. They manage the foundation that everything else is built on, and provide the tools to support Descriptâ€™s entire engineering org and customers. This is one of the most important roles in the company.

Though we might not be actively hiring for all teams at this time, you can take a sneak peek into what engineering teams exist today.

### What Youâ€™ll Do

  * Use of web technologies to deliver a high-performance professional creative tool that's traditionally been the domain of native desktop applications.
  * Build v2 of our server and client platforms to turbocharge engineering productivity across Descript, allowing us to ship faster to our users.
  * Build and deploy service infrastructure in support of Descriptâ€™s production services with emphasis on security, reliability, and scalability.
  * Support observability of highly available services relied upon by our users to support its availability and performance through telemetry, alerts, and SLOs.

### What You Bring

  * 5+ years of professional software development experience
  * Youâ€™re comfortable with uncertainty, maybe even thrive in it; you can take large projects and break them down into small, concrete features and then build those incrementally.
  * Experience building and managing highly available distributed applications
  * Proficiency in one or more programming languages like Typescript, Python, Go etc and technologies such as
    * Cloud infra platforms e.g. GCP, AWS, Azure
    * Databases e.g. PostGreSQL, Bigtable, BigQuery, Redis, etc.
    * Container runtimes e.g. Docker
  * Strong written and verbal communication

### Nice to Have:

  * You know how to prioritize when everything is vying for your attention. Even if it means letting some fires burn while you put out more important ones.
  * Experience with the following technologies
    * durable workflow platforms like Temporal
    * IaC tools like Terraform
    * Container orchestration platforms e.g. K8s
  * Proficiency in database design, sharding, replication, and tuning for high-traffic environments
  * Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines spanning code regressions, reproducible builds, and deployment strategies along with the associated infrastructure

At our current size and stage, we embrace a flat organizational structure and value the expertise and contributions of every team member. As such, we have a unified job title for our engineering roles where everyone, including those with Staff-level scope, is considered a Software Engineer. While titles may not change, we are actively seeking senior and above Software Engineers to join our team.

The base salary range for this role is $160,000-$230,000/year. Final offer amounts will carefully consider multiple factors, including prior experience, expertise, location, and may vary from the amount above.
