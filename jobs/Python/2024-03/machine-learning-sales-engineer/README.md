### **The Opportunity**

AI is rapidly changing the world. From processing job applications and credit decisions, to making content recommendations and helping researchers analyze genetic markers at scale -- many aspects of our daily lives are touched by machine learned systems in some way.

Arize is the leading machine learning observability platform to help ML teams discover issues, diagnose problems, and improve the results of machine learning models. In short: we are here to build world class software that helps make AI work better.

### **The Team**

Our engineering team builds systems that interact with some of the most complex software ever deployed in production. The team is composed of industry veterans that have built deep learning infrastructure, autonomous drones, ridesharing marketplaces, ad tech and much more. We are looking for a Sales Engineer to join the good fight and get this product in the hands of every Machine Learning organization.

You'll work side-by-side with our Account Executives to articulate the Arize value and overall strategy to differentiate the platform throughout the sales process and drive POCs from requirements gathering to close. The activities performed by a Sales Engineer are diverse - one day you might be assisting with a high-level pitch of Arize to a CDO, and the next day you might be working hands-on to develop a small proof of concept.

  * You ask the right questions with the customer to uncover nuances in their unique deployments.
  * Ability to work within ambiguity and take action with limited direction

**Knowledgeable in Machine Learning:**

  * You may not have a PhD in ML but you know the difference between Linear Regression and Boosted Trees and the advantages / disadvantages of each.
