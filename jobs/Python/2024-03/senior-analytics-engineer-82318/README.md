Our proven learning platform offers free, high-quality supplemental learning resources that cover Pre-K - 12th grade and early college core academic subjects, with a focus on math and science. We have over 155 million registered learners globally and are committed to improving learning outcomes for students around the world, with a focus on learners in historically under-resourced communities.

### OUR COMMUNITY

Our students, teachers, and parents come from all walks of life, and so do we. Our team includes people from academia, traditional/non-traditional education, big tech companies, and tiny startups. We hire great people from diverse backgrounds and experiences because it makes our company stronger.

We know that transforming education starts in-house with learning about ourselves and our colleagues. We strive to be world-class in investing in our people and commit to developing you as a professional.

### THE ROLE

Weâ€™re a small team with big dreams and weâ€™re only just getting started. We have some of the richest educational data in the world, and we want to leverage that data to develop a clearer picture of who our users are, how they are using the site, and how we could better serve them on their educational journey. Your work will enable answering critical and meaningful questions like "how do students learn most effectively?" and "how can we improve our content and product?".

The Sr. Analytics Engineer will strengthen our capabilities to enable the organization to use data to inform our decisions. As the second hire in our Business Data Engineering team in our Data Insights Group, youâ€™ll have ownership of our enterprise data model and the core data pipelines that power our top line metrics and critical analyses.

The Sr. Analytics Engineer is someone who enjoys tidying and documenting data and then delighting in the companyâ€™s well-organized EDW. You favor writing SQL to transform raw data into the data models to service your customers, the Analytics and Research teams, to empower them to generate actionable insights for stakeholders. Youâ€™ll work on projects that improve the quality and reliability of our existing data, and youâ€™ll also enable entire new areas of the organization with new core data sources. And you adopt software engineering best practices to produce high quality data solutions.

### What youâ€™ll do:

  * Systematically build out our enterprise data model and warehouse:
    * Design, build, and productionize our ever-improving suite of core pipelines and data tables to enable standardized reporting and analysis.
    * Collaborate with engineers on the infrastructure team to improve our data technology stack (logging, instrumentation, ETL, security). You may also pitch in to help them bring new data into our warehouse.
    * Partner with analytics team members, the research team, and the broader product and business teams to design and standardize business rules and metric definitions. 
    * Implement EDW standards and robust monitoring/QA processes to ensure we continue to improve the quality and reliability of our data.
  * Empower every team with data:
    * Identify, pilot, and deploy whichever tools, datasets, and processes are best suited to increase access to and data use across Khan Academy to empower data-driven decision-making.
    * In addition to supporting members of the Data Insights Group, work with the product, content, philanthropy, marketing teams, and others to bring data to their fingertips, ideally with solutions that allow them to self-serve with our Looker implementation.
    * You will also build infrastructural data solutions to facilitate reporting to external partners and will ensure the highest standards of data accuracy, reliability, and security
  * Help instill a â€˜data drivenâ€™/â€™data informedâ€™ culture:
    * Shepherd our Metrics and Data Documentation wiki
    * Train team members on data skills and tooling

### WHAT YOU BRING:

  * 6+ years experience in analytics/data engineering or data warehousing; or in a business intelligence field with a strong emphasis on data modeling and pipeline work. Preference for experience in a consumer-facing internet business or edtech setting.
  * Advanced SQL skills (window functions, creating UDFs, DML/DDL commands, etc.)
  * Proficiency in writing and maintaining data pipelines and data quality monitors in a workflow management tool for productionized solutions, with source control and code review.
  * Proficiency in computer science and software engineering fundamentals, including at least one scripting language (e.g., Python)
  * Experience across the entire data lifecycle: instrumentation, logging, data modeling, ETL, Business Intelligence, and visualization tools.
