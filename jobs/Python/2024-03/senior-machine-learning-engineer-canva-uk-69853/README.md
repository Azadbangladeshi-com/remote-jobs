### Canva  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but we have a swanky new office in London that has all the bells and whistles. Even though you'll find us in Shoreditch, you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Lead the development of end-to-end pipelines for training, evaluating and deploying ML models to solve a variety of problems related to the many steps that make up a data visualisation workflow (data sourcing, data preparation, chart generation, insight extraction, visual presentation, etc.)
  * Experiment with and evaluate the effectiveness of open-source and 3rd party models for Canvaâ€™s bespoke needs in the data visualisation space, as well as explore the parameters that define success for AI in this domain.
  * Work alongside data visualisation experts to identify and advise on opportunities for applying ML models to high-impact business opportunities.
  * Develop performant data pipelines that provide AI model training and evaluation workflows with access to data assets that are legally compliant and aligned with Canvasâ€™s strict policies around data usage for AI.
  * Work closely with product and design, as well as backend and frontend engineers, to ideate on and design product features that will enable millions of users to leverage AI in a way that meaningfully improves their ability to use data and data story telling in their visual communication.

### You're probably a match if

  * You bring at least 5+ years of industry experience building machine learning applications in a software engineering (or equivalent) style role, using industry-standard technologies for production-focussed machine learning (Python, SQL, PyTorch/Tensorflow, Kubernetes/Docker, etc.)
  * You have experience in building and deploying machine learning models to distributed production environments, including a strong understanding of end-to-end machine learning pipelines and components.
  * You have experience developing robust evaluation methodologies and workflows for complex or bespoke problem domains.
  * You possess strong research synthesis skills: the ability to dig through deep/machine learning literature and translate this into products and value for users.
  * You have industry experience working with and optimizing SoTA computer vision and/or natural language processing models for use in settings with high-performance requirements and/or compute constraints.

### About the team

AI and machine learning have the potential to greatly increase the accessibility of data visualisation techniques to data-shy users, and creative applications of visual and natural language-based AI will allow our advanced users to create data visualisations from their complex data that were inconceivable just a few years ago. Youâ€™ll help us expand our exciting developments in this space (informed by the acquisition of leading dataviz company Flourish) while also exploring new related areas.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
