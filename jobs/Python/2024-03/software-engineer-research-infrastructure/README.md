Description

Anthropic is seeking an experienced engineer for our Research Infrastructure team. You'll lead initiatives supporting some of the largest, most sophisticated clusters in industry used to train, research, and ultimately serve AI models. Your work will be crucial in ensuring Anthropic is able to continue reliably and safely training frontier models! The Research Infrastructure team addresses the problem of developing and scaling systems that enable researchers to iterate quickly and also scale key systems/ components used by researchers during the development phase to work at production scale as our model footprint grows.

  

 **About Anthropic**

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and society. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.

### Responsibilities:

  * Lead build out of industry-leading AI clusters (thousands to hundreds of thousands of machines), partnering closely with cloud service providers on cluster build out and required features
  * Consult with different stakeholders to deeply understand infrastructure and compute needs, identifying potential solutions to support frontier research and product development
  * Set technical strategy and oversee development of high scale, reliable infrastructure systems
  * Mentor top technical talent
  * Design processes (e.g. postmortem review, incident response, on-call rotations) that help the team operate effectively and never fail the same way twice

### You may be a good fit if you:

  * Have 8+ years of relevant industry experience and 3+ years leading large scale, complex projects or teams as an engineer or tech lead
  * Are obsessed with distributed systems at scale, and have a good handle on ML foundations and/or ML systems
  * Have a passion for supporting internal partners like research to understand their needs
  * Have excellent communication skills to build consensus with stakeholders, both internally and externally
  * Possess deep knowledge of modern cloud infrastructure including Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, AWS, and GCP
  * Functional knowledge of python/ rust.

### Strong candidates may also:

  * Have security and privacy best practice expertise
  * Experience with machine learning infrastructure like GPUs, TPUs, or Trainium, as well as supporting networking infrastructure like NCCL
  * Low level systems experience, for example linux kernel tuning and eBPF 
  * Technical expertise: Quickly understanding systems design tradeoffs, keeping track of rapidly evolving software systems

### Representative projects:

  * Model lifecycle management
  * Streamlining model deployments across various supported environments
  * Model & weights caching 
  * Weight management & access controls
  * Sandboxing/ exec environment for generated code

### Annual Salary:

  * The expected salary range for this position is $300K-$520K

 **Logistics**

 **Location-based hybrid policy:** Currently, we expect all staff to be in our office at least 25% of the time.

  

 **Deadline to apply** : None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

  

 **US visa sponsorship:** We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

  

 **We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

  

 **Compensation and Benefits***

Anthropicâ€™s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.

  

 **Equity** \- On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.

  

 **US Benefits** \- The following benefits are for our US-based employees:

\- Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.

\- Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.

\- 401(k) plan with 4% matching.

\- 22 weeks of paid parental leave.

\- Unlimited PTO â€“ most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!

\- Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.

\- Fertility benefits via Carrot.

\- Daily lunches and snacks in our office.

\- Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.

  

 **UK Benefits** \- The following benefits are for our UK-based employees:

\- Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.

\- Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.

\- Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary).

\- 22 weeks of paid parental leave.

\- Unlimited PTO â€“ most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!

 _* This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropicâ€™s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial._

  

 **How we're different**

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact â€” advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI â€” rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

  

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

  

 **Come work with us!**

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
