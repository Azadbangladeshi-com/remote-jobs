### Yohana  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

At Yohana, weâ€™re finding new ways for technology and design to lighten our loads, reclaim our time, and improve our well-being. We want it all. A career and home. Family and friends. Health and wellness. But actually having it all can leave us feeling overloaded. And research shows it. 43% of people struggle with decision-making. 66% say overload affects their work, and 62%, their interpersonal relationships.

Technology was supposed to help by making us more efficient. But the faster we get things done, the more we take on, and our well-being falls to the bottom of the list. Yohana is on a mission to make balance a priority â€“ and do it joyfully.

Itâ€™s a meaningful product challenge: helping society reclaim time and make space for joy through technology and design. Thatâ€™s what the team at Yohana is solving for every day, and we have a lot of fun doing it. With leadership from big tech like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and hypergrowth startups like Nest, Waymo, TaskRabbit, and Casper, weâ€™re motivated to make the world a happier place. Join us!
