### Affirm  
#### `ðŸ’° 333100.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.

The Partner Interfaces group at Affirm builds the APIs and webhooks that power all of Affirmâ€™s integrations with merchants and partners. The Partner Interfaces sub-team represents the portion of this group that manages partners - large customers such as Shopify that themselves manage multiple merchants. Its job is to create and manage the APIs and other tools that power the experience in the websites of those partners, such as checkout and merchant onboarding, as well as orchestrate the end-to-end integration solution for them.  

We are looking for a highly motivated and experienced software engineer to join us and help fulfill our vision. The work will be challenging due to the speed at which the market is growing, and the work involved will directly impact the growth trajectory of the merchant network.

###  **What you'll do:**

  * Work with product and engineering managers to identify and plan projects based on the team goals and resources.
  * Drive detailed project definition, design, cross-functional alignment, estimation, in addition to task break-down, delivery, monitoring, and maintenance.
  * Consistently generate simple and elegant designs, and write high-quality code that can be easily understood and leveraged by others.
  * Build relationships with people across engineering and other organizations for the design, implementation, roll-out and maintenance of projects.
  * Actively participate in making your team and workplace an inclusive environment for people from all backgrounds.  
  

### What we look for:

  * 2 - 3 years of experience as a software engineer
  * Passion for working with cross-functional teams including Product, Design, Analytics and Business teams.
  * Ability to synthesize complex business, product, and technical requirements to consistently produce high quality system designs and software.
  * Experience succeeding as the technical lead of a large, potentially ambiguous project involving multiple stakeholders and contributors.
  * A humble team-player who places the needs of others first, participates in the development of peers on the team, and mentors and guides more junior members in areas where they may have less experience.
  * Exposure to any of the following technologies is a plus, but not required: API development, Python, MySql, ElasticSearch, AWS, Docker, and Flask/Celery.

  * Flexible Spending Wallets for tech, food and lifestyle
