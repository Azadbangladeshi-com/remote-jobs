### Proficio  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Singapore`  

Proficio is an award-winning managed detection and response (MDR) services provider. We provide 24/7 security monitoring, investigation, alerting and response services to organizations in healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, retail and other industries. Take a video tour of our global network of 24/7 Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

Proficio has been highlighted in Gartnerâ€™s Market Guide for Managed Detection and Response Services for the last five consecutive years. MSSP Alert ranks Proficio among the top 250 global Managed Security Services Providers (MSSPs).

We have a track record of innovation. Proficio invented the concept of SOC-as-a-Service. We were the first MSSP to provide automated response services and are the only company in our space with a patent for cyber risk scoring and security posture gap analysis.

Our typical client is a medium to large-sized organization that lacks the in-house resources to address the challenges of a rapidly changing threat landscape. The difficulty of hiring and retaining cybersecurity professionals are widely understood. Our prospective clients are also challenged to effectively harness technology and build hardened processes that reduce the risk of security breaches.

While Proficio has developed a unified service delivery platform designed to meet the needs of the most demanding clients, what sets us apart is the quality and passion of our people. We believe the SOC of the Future will meld the creativity of human intelligence with the power of advanced technologies like AI.

Proficioâ€™s commitment to developing and promoting our team members is unparalleled in our industry. Most of our senior managers were promoted from within.
