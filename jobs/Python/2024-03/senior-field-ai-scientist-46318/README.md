**Our Purpose**

At Fiddler, we understand the implications of AI and the impact that it has on human lives. Our company was born with the mission of building trust into AI.

Fiddler enables organizations to get ahead of these issues by building trustworthy, transparent, and explainable AI solutions.

Fiddler partners with AI-first organizations to help build a long-term framework for responsible AI practices, which, in turn, builds trust with their user base. Data Science, MLOps, and business teams use Fiddler AI to monitor, explain, analyze, and improve their AI solutions to identify performance gaps, mitigate bias, and drive better outcomes. Our platform enables engineering teams and business stakeholders alike to understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and how behind model outcomes.

**Our Founders**

Fiddler AI is founded by Krishna Gade (engineering leadership at Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and Microsoft) and Amit Paka (two-time founder with acquisitions by Samsung and PayPal and product roles at Expedia and Microsoft). We are backed by Insight Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Lux Capital.
