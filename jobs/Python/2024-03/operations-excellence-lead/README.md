### Superside  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Superside is seeking an Operations Excellence Lead who is driven by impacting solutions, has a passion for data, and possesses strong communication and stakeholders management skills. This role is key to enhancing our creative services.

As a member of our growing team, you'll play a vital role in our Operations Excellence area, focusing on staff operations to ensure our customers have top-notch teams for their creative projects. You'll also recommend process enhancements and collect valuable data to boost our operations.

Reporting to the Head of Staff Operations, youâ€™ll make significant contributions to a crucial part of Superside, working with team members at every level to make a positive impact throughout the organization.

### What you'll be doing:

  * Play a pivotal role in the Staff Operations team by contributing to redefine staffing strategies to enhance customer satisfaction together with senior management
  * Independently lead and drive the achievement of OKRs (content and process), which are established in collaboration with senior management in Staff Operations
  * Conduct hypothesis driven data analysis (80/20 approach) and oversee staff ops KPIs to guarantee that our teams are the best suited to consistently deliver an exceptional customer experience 
  * Proactively identify operational challenges and spearhead the development of enhancements within staff operations, encompassing processes, data and technology
  * Autonomously manage relationships with stakeholders within the broader organization
  * Gather feedback and insights to champion continuous improvement efforts and strategic initiatives
  * Cultivate a deep understanding of our operational processes to serve as a knowledgeable resource for staff ops and the broader Ops Excellence team

### What youâ€™ll need to succeed:

  * 3-4 years of past experience in operations (at a tech start-up or scale-up is a bonus)
  * Excellent English verbal and written communication skills
  * Data analytics skills (e.g. SQL, R, Python, google sheets, excel) and strong ability and passion for building a data-driven future of work
  * Outstanding attention to details
  * High personal standards for quality, accountability, and reliability
  * Willingness to learn and quickly adapt to changes in a fast-paced environment
  * Excellent stakeholders management skills with the ability to interact successfully with many stakeholders and the emotional intelligence needed to handle delicate situations
  * Great project management skills: you independently own your projects from start to finish

### Our biggest challenge right now

  * Superside has its own in-house DesignOps system allowing our creatives, project managers, and creative leads to collaborate seamlessly with customers. We've been scaling fast and growing a lot in the past years. With hundreds of team members and demand for projects, we now need to manage the task of efficiently staffing people on accounts. That calls for someone who is able to autonomously find and come up with creative solutions to the relevant issues.
