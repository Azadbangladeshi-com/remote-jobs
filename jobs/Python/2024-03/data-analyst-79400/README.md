  * Understand the business logic of how newsrooms sort and categorize traffic data by article and site sections 
  * A high degree of integrity and discretion; must be willing to sign a nondisclosure agreement
  * Skill in analyzing and visualizing data, drawing actionable insights, and communicating strategic tactics informed by data to non-technical audiences
  * Experience working in a newsroom and communicating with stakeholders like editors and senior newsroom leadership 
  * A passion for being analytical and detail oriented on not just reporting data, but also surfacing themes around key trends and results
