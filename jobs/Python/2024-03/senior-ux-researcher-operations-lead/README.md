Technology is one of the most important parts of our business. Whether it‚Äôs signing up new artists; ensuring we provide the right data to Spotify, YouTube, and other digital service providers; or helping artists use the latest AI tools and make thoughtful decisions with data-driven insights ‚Äì technology plays an invaluable role in our success. The engineering team at Warner Music Group makes all of it a reality.

  

WMG‚Äôs User Experience Team is looking for a Sr Researcher/Research Ops Lead who will help us lay the foundation for effective, organized and consistent research across the organization. The goal of the UX Team is two fold: to transform our digital product experiences to help artists, songwriters, producers, A&R, marketing and finance users build long lasting music careers for Artists and Songwriters, and to help Artists authentically connect with their fans. Both helping to push boundaries and find new, innovative ways to improve our business.

  

Our research team is small and the majority of early user interviews and evaluative research is currently done by non-researchers.

* Learn from and collaborate with folks from across the music and tech industry to grow your career and industry knowledge.
