# [Machine Learning Engineer in the Optimization team - EMEA remote](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/machine-learning-engineer-in-the-optimization-team-emea-remote-31985)  
### Hugging Face  
#### `ðŸŒŽ France`  

Here at Hugging Face, weâ€™re on a journey to advance good Machine Learning and make it more accessible. Along the way, we contribute to the development of technology for the better.

We have built the fastest-growing, open-source, library of pre-trained models in the world. With more than 1 Million+ models and 320K+ stars on GitHub, over 15.000 companies are using HF technology in production, including leading AI organizations such as Google, Elastic, Salesforce, Grammarly and NASA.

Transformers in NLP pushed forward the computational requirements and the trend started to expand to other modalities such as Computer Vision and Speech which are actively adopting Transformer architectures to build the latest state-of-the-art models.

### About the Role

Hugging Face has become the most popular, community-driven project for training, sharing, and deploying the most advanced machine learning models. Workload efficiency is key to our mission of democratizing state of the art and we are always looking to push the boundaries for faster, and more efficient ways to train and deploy models.

If you like digging into the dark side of low-level system integrations, compiler support, and framework optimizations: we should talk!

We are looking for talented people to join the Hugging Face Special Ops team, focusing on:

  * Bridging ðŸ¤— transformers models with state-of-the-art AI hardware
  * Ensuring the above models meet the expected performance
  * Designing easy to use and proficient Developer Experience for our users
  * Deploying these models in the most efficient and scalable way.

This is an exciting opportunity to work at the edge of AI on both model architectures and hardware technologies! As additional material, you may want to take a look at the recent announcement about the collaboration with GraphCore on IPUs to get a better sense of what it means in practice ðŸ¤—.

### About You

Youâ€™ll enjoy working in this team if you like digging into the dark side of low-level system integrations, compiler support, and framework optimizations. At the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, you would be in charge of integrating the latest features from our hardware partners in Python/C++, designing rich and easy Python APIs in the continuity of what Hugging Face did with transformers, tokenizers, and the datasets library with a strong focus on performances. Linux or embedded devices experience would be a great plus for the job.
