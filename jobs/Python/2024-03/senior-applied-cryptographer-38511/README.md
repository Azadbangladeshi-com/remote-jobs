### Monad Labs  
#### `ðŸ’° 400000.0`  

Monad Labs is a venture-backed startup building the **Monad blockchain** , a high-performance smart contract platform built to bring world adoption to decentralized apps. Monad delivers 1000x the throughput of Ethereumâ€”10,000 transactions per secondâ€”while maintaining backward-compatibility for Ethereum smart contracts, offering users and developers the best of both worlds.

Founded by Jump Trading alums, our team solves challenging problems in distributed systems engineering and low-latency optimization, authoring novel open source code to implement a new, high-performance, high-reliability, high-value system.

After recently raising a $19 million seed round backed by Dragonfly Capital, Placeholder Capital, Naval Ravikant, and other leaders in the crypto space, we are hiring a few more exceptional engineers who want to work on challenging and impactful problems in a fast-paced environment.

### The Role

We are looking for an exceptional Senior Applied Cryptographer who is interested in cryptographic protocols and their application to blockchain. You will play a leading role in designing and implementing critical components of the blockchain, such as signature schemes, threshold encryption, distributed key generation, and zero-knowledge proofs. Your work will significantly contribute to the security and scalability of the platform.

### Who you are

  * Resourceful and self-motivated
  * Team oriented, collaborative, and a good communicator
  * Adaptive; able to make meaningful contributions in a fast-paced environment
  * Opinionated about software architecture
  * Motivated to push the limits of system performance through repeated optimization
  * Interested in building high-value fault-tolerant distributed systems

### Requirements:

  * Advanced degree in applied cryptography
  * 5 years of experience in applied cryptography in an academic or industrial setting
  * Excellent knowledge of modern cryptography primitives, such as zero-knowledge proofs, signature schemes, threshold encryption, and MPC
  * Strong programming skills in languages like python or C++

#### **Bonus:**

  * Research publications
  * Contributions to open source projects
  * Startup experience

### What youâ€™ll be doing

  * Designing and implementing crucial cryptographic components of the blockchain, such as signature schemes, threshold encryption, distributed key generation, and zero-knowledge proofs.
  * Conducting literature review and researching opportunities to incorporate the latest advances into the workflow.

### Why work with us

  * Youâ€™ll work on extremely challenging problems with massive impact
  * Youâ€™ll work with and learn from a small, exceptional team 
  * Youâ€™ll receive a competitive salary, along with equity
  * Youâ€™ll shape the culture as an early employee and make impactful contributions from day one
  * Youâ€™ll be part of a flat, results-driven organization
  * Your work will be deeply impactful, enabling much cheaper and more efficient decentralized computation and ultimately paving the way for new dapps that improve many peopleâ€™s lives.

### **Salary and benefits**

Minimum full-time salary of $200,000. (** _This is not a guarantee of compensation or salary; a final offer amount may vary based on factors including but not limited to experience and geographic location.)_
