### Canva  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Australia`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Being the driving force behind our data-centric approach in the Multimedia Group. Your primary objective will be to harness data to provide our leaders and product managers with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions that drive the direction of the group.
  * Working closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that our data strategies align with the broader goals of the group.
  * Coaching a team of data scientists. This role will act as a driver of data strategy in this group and will coordinate closely with the Multimedia leadership team.
  * Suggesting and running interesting experiments that will actually move our metrics - when we push tests to 100% we want to actually see the bump in the relevant graph.
  * Building and maintaining dashboards for group initiatives, and connect them with real business outcomes.
  * Using our giant databases to answer the sort of questions that sound really simple but turn out to be challenging (and fun!).

### You're probably a match if:

  * You have proven experience leading data specialists, and defining team strategy and data roadmaps.
  * You've got experience working with SaaS data sets and experimental frameworks.
  * You have proficiency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
  * You know how to wrangle and analyse data using Python or R.
  * You have experience with optimising product funnels, running experiments, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes.

### About the team

The mission of our Multimedia Group is to make multimedia storytelling quick, simple, and fun for everyone. This group sits within the Design Experience Supergroup, focusing on optimising photo and video features for our users. By working closely with the Product and Engineering teams, we aim to make Canva the go-to platform for multimedia design and editing.

The remit of our team is diverse - we have supported Canva leadership on various multimedia-centric initiatives. Examples include â€˜How can we improve multimedia content discovery on Canva?â€™, â€˜Which multimedia features increase user retention?â€™, â€˜How can we use AI to enhance multimedia design?â€™ and â€˜Which multimedia trends should we integrate into Canva?â€™ - amongst many more!

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
