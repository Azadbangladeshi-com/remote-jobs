### About the role:

As a Sales Engineering leader at Samsara, youâ€™d be building and looking after a diverse team of SEâ€™s working together to bring our unique connected operations technology to customers. Your teamâ€™s work would directly contribute to a cleaner, more efficient and productive supply chain by creating safer roadways, reducing fuel consumption and emissions, and providing a consolidated platform for connecting operations. Daily customer engagements include conversations around how IoT can positively impact logistics management, workplace safety programs, fleet maintenance strategies, global asset management, and regulatory compliance. This means a successful SE at Samsara will develop a thorough understanding of the application of IoT hardware and sensors, hands-on hardware installation strategies, managing data collection over carrier networks, presenting a robust cloud infrastructure, and building third-party system integrations (via our open API) to ensure the best technical solution is
presented to Samsara customers.

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** Your efforts will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  *  **You have innate curiosity in how businesses work:** One day youâ€™ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact. 
  * **You build genuine relationships with your customers:** The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and havenâ€™t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.
  *  **You want to be with the best:** Samsaraâ€™s high-performance culture means youâ€™ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before. 
  * **You are a team player:** At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.
