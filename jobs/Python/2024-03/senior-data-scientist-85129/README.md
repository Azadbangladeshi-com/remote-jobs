### ActBlue  
#### `ðŸ’° 365885.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### WHO WE ARE:

ActBlue is a nonprofit that builds tech and infrastructure for Democratic campaigns, progressive-aligned causes, and people trying to make an impact in order to fuel long-term, people-powered change. If youâ€™ve ever given online to a Democrat or progressive organization, chances are youâ€™ve used our powerful online fundraising platform.

We put power in the hands of small-dollar donors and help thousands of groups â€” from presidential candidates to environmental organizations â€” build grassroots movements. We envision a democracy where everyone looking to make progressive people-powered change can easily and effectively deploy their resources, energy, and creativity to shape our country and futures. Each and every one of us, from the political activists to the tech innovators to the customer service pros, is fully committed to our mission.

### THE OPPORTUNITY:

As a Data Scientist at ActBlue, you will act as a subject matter expert on all things small-dollar donor, from conversion rates on our contribution forms to trends in campaign finance data. Senior Data Scientists at ActBlue demonstrate influence on difficult problems faced by multiple teams. They are expected to deliver outcomes that have greater impact than the immediate problem. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the experience of small dollar donors and serve as an advocate for the small dollar donor movement.

Data Scientists work as part of cross-functional teams alongside Data Analysts. We collaborate to solve for descriptive and prescriptive stakeholder needs and provide data services and products to ActBlue and its users using tools and languages like SQL (PostgreSQL, Redshift, MySQL), R, Python, dbt, and Looker.

### WHAT YOU WILL DO:

  * Be of service. Build rich relationships with colleagues and external partners to answer questions about ActBlueâ€™s tools and the impact of small-dollar donors, provide support to team members while integrating several project goals, and self-prioritize to hit key project timelines and objectives.
  * Take ownership of open-ended ambiguous problems end-to-end, including anticipating issues, with measurable checkpoints, in order to deliver reliably and consistently for our stakeholders.
  * Build shared power. Strengthen analytical capacity across the organization, including by improving reporting workflows, assessing and collecting requirements for new analytics products, and training end users on the use of internal data products.
  * Practice curiosity. Be proactive in identifying insights that have the potential to have a positive impact and in communicating those insights to teammates.
  * Nurture trust. Effectively and empathetically communicate the knowns and unknowns of our analyses and data products to teammates across the organization.
  * Adapt with intention. Manage and prioritize multiple requests and workstreams, some with tight deadlines and some with loosely defined instructions and desired outcomes.
  * Foster belonging. Commit to being a member of a diverse and inclusive team. Provide mentorship to junior teammates, offer respectful feedback, and celebrate team wins. 
  * Take care. Serve as a conscientious steward of our data, being as thoughtful with donor and user data as you would hope someone would be with your own.

### WHAT YOU BRING:

  * 5-7 years experience or equivalent as a data scientist, including at least 2 years at an internet scale company, in a product, ads, marketing or financial data science role. (Note: Advanced degree in quantitative discipline can offset work experience) 
  * Practical experience with applying statistical modeling and analysis towards complex problems (e.g. nonlinear time series forecasting, causal inference, ensemble or hybrid ML models)
  * Intermediate proficiency with R (tidyverse, ggplot2) or Python (pandas, matplotlib).
  * Expert in SQL with mastery of complex logic, coding best practices, query performance, and SQL-based data pipelines.
  * Experience with defining and reporting Key Performance Indicators to support business or product reviews with cross-functional leadership teams
  * Experience with experiment design and measurement
  * Comfort distilling complex insights into product improvement opportunities for senior executives, both verbally and visually.
  * Fluency using business intelligence tools to generate data visualizations that communicate complex insights. Looker preferred.
  * A successful track record of recommendation-driven insights.
  * Excellent teamwork skills. You thrive on collaboration, shared learning, and problem-solving.
  * Scrappiness, a can-do attitude, and resourcefulness.
  * Excellent peer and code review skills, including being a mentor for junior colleagues
  * Pluses:
    * Previous political experience, either professional or volunteer.
    * Experience with dbt, especially creating or modifying SQL models.
    * Experience with GitHub and source code control best practices.
    * Experience creating data products for external stakeholders.
