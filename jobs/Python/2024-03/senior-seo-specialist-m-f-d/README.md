### Additional Information

  * **Your start at The Stepstone Group:** We want you to feel comfortable right from the get-go and you can begin networking immediately. That's why we always start with an onboarding event lasting several days, during which you get to know your new colleagues, our products and our culture. After that, the onboarding continues in your department - with several weeks of individual training. â€‹
  * **Your further development:** We are growing - and of course we want you to grow with us. We will support you with targeted training that will help you develop both personally and professionally. â€‹
  * **Big player with start-up flair:** Even though we've grown quite a bit, we haven't lost our laidback attitude from the early days. In concrete terms, this means that we are on a first-name basis, we have short communication channels, flat hierarchies and super helpful colleagues. â€‹
  * **Social Days:** Talk is silver, action is golden - which is exactly why all our employees have 2 Social Days a year. These can be used flexibly for social and sustainable commitment. And the best thing about it: you don't have to take any holidays. â€‹
  * **Holidays:** While we're on the subject of holidays ... We offer 30 days of paid leave per year plus one customary day. And we always have Christmas and New Year's Eve off. â€‹
  * **Four-legged friends welcome!** Would you like to bring your dog? With pleasure. Every day is "bring-your-dog-to-work-day"!â€‹
