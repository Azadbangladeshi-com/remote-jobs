Kalepa is an award-winning software start-up re-imagining the trillion-dollar commercial insurance industry. Our cross-functional teams leverage AI, cutting-edge tech, and tons of data to help commercial insurance underwriters Bind with Confidence.

### Why We're Here:

For hundreds of years. businesses have tried to find the right policy to protect themselves and their employees. However, commercial insurance is plagued with a big problem: it's really complicated!

Insurers find it hard to understand the true exposures of businesses and to profitably provide them with policies that reflect that risk. Businesses - like contractors, hotels, restaurants, transportation fleets, real estate lessors, and others - struggle to find the coverage they need and are often left underinsured, uninsured, or paying too much for what they need.

That's where we come in. Our **AI-powered underwriting workbench - Copilot -** compiles everything underwriters need, and flags the exposures they need to know about. With Copilot, underwriters can find critical information in a flash; digitize their underwriting guidelines; triage, prioritize, and track their book; and automatically read and summarize key documents, like loss runs and supplemental applications ‚Äì all out of the box. This means that insurance carriers grow faster and are more profitable, and businesses get the right coverage at the right rates. **It‚Äôs the way insurance should work.**

### Salary range: $72k ‚Äì $96k

### Equity range: 0.005% ‚Äì 0.025%

### What we are looking for:

 **As a Machine Learning Engineer you will lead the framing, development, and deployment at scale of machine learning models to understand the risk of various classes of businesses.** You will be turning vast amounts of structured and unstructured data from many sources (web data, geolocation, satellite imaging, etc.) into novel insights about behavior and risk.
