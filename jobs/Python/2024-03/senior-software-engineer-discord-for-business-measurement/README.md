Description

## Come build the future of Discordâ€™s business with us! We are looking for impact-focused engineers to join our world-class Revenue group as we accelerate Discordâ€™s growth through the creation of compelling paid products. These products allow us to grow our business while keeping Discordâ€™s core functionality free. You will be reporting to the Senior Engineering Manager of Revenue Infrastructure. To learn more about Discord Engineering, take a look at our engineering blog.

### **What you'll be doing:**

  * Design, build and maintain a system for accurately measuring the impact of paid promotions, including impressions, clicks, and attribution. Collaborate with engineers on the team, and other teams such as Data Platform, to understand requirements and build systems to meet them.
  * Be a founding team member of an important company initiative that we believe will lead to substantial revenue growth for the business
  * Solve complex domain problems in the areas of high-volume and accurate data collection, real-time reporting, budget pacing, and frequency capping
  * Partner with stakeholders and engineers across a small set of teams to define problems and build solutions into high scale, reliable and observable infrastructure
  * Own projects end to end â€” youâ€™ll be responsible for working with Product and other stakeholders to refine requirements, creating technical designs and specs, implementing changes, and seeing projects through to launch and maintenance

### **What you should have:**

  * **5+ years of software engineering experience.** We primarily work in the backend (Python, Rust, and Elixir) to build systems for metrics collection. We build on top of systems like Flink, PubSub, Pulsar, and Airflow. You have familiarity with similar systems and a background building scalable and accurate event tracking, aggregation, database design, querying, and data caching.
  * **You have a data and infrastructure mindset**. You are excited to dig into large datasets to validate data and algorithms, and enjoy designing well-built, available and observable systems. You also are familiar with querying and presentation of complex data. You have experience working with infrastructure in cloud environments such as GCS, and using observability tools similar to Datadog.
  * **You stay up to date on relevant technology trends and developments.** You view challenges and mistakes as learning opportunities while building upon your successes. You push yourself and those around you to improve
  * **You have a product sense.** You maintain a high degree of empathy for your internal and external users, and seek feedback from them about your work
  * **You love business impact.** You get excited seeing numbers go up (or down!) as a result of your work

### **Bonus Points**

  * Experience working in ad tech, especially on ad campaign performance measurement, budget forecasting, and pricing models
