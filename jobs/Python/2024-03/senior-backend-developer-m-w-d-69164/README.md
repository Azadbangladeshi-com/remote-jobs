# [Senior Backend Developer (m/w/d)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-backend-developer-m-w-d-69164)  
### Octopus Energy  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Germany`  

Kraken **is the technology** **tentacle** **of the Octopus Energy Group.**

### Our team

All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around 500 people globally. Our engineers work in â€˜super teamsâ€™ which are focused on key domains of our platform as well as other innovative products. This also includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers.

Teams are empowered to choose a way of working that works for them, often opting for a Kanban-like approach. Notion and Asana are then used to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Datadog, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.

Some of our coding conventions are open-source .

Kraken is a great place to learn, work with talented engineers and have a lot of fun.

### What youâ€™ll do:

  * We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The utilities market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
  * We have challenging technical problems to solve; like processing tens of millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption. Or thinking about how we adapt Kraken to improve other utilities like water and broadband.
  * There's a great opportunity for disruption across the energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.
  * You'll be working for a company thatâ€™s fighting climate change. Our generation arm is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and is funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.

### What youâ€™ll need:

  * Good communication in English - other languages such as German, French, Italian or Spanish is a plus
  * A general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):
  * Python: You should have solid knowledge and experience in Python development to create efficient and scalable backend solutions.
  * Django (or equivalent web framework): You have worked with Django or an equivalent web framework to support and accelerate web application development.
  * Domain modeling: You possess competence in domain modeling and implementing these models into effective backend structures to support complex business logic.
  * HTTP and REST APIs, as well as GraphQL: You have in-depth understanding and hands-on experience in developing and implementing both REST and GraphQL APIs, ensuring efficient communication and flexibility between frontend and backend systems.
  * Writing robust and fault-tolerant software: You can write robust and fault-tolerant software that runs smoothly and reliably even under adverse conditions.
  * Celery and async processing: You have gained experience with Celery and asynchronous processing to efficiently handle tasks in the background and optimize backend performance.
  * Postgres: You have knowledge and experience in working with Postgres to develop and manage database applications that meet scalability, performance, and data integrity requirements.

### Our Benefits:

  * An internationally positioned team with flat hierarchies and open and transparent communication
  * We rely on flexible working hours
  * Share options: You will have the opportunity to participate in the international success of Octopus Energy Group Ltd. through share options.
  * Language connects: Take your English skills to the next level with Busuu, our corporate language training provider
  * For more exercise: Lease your favourite bicycle from us at a low price
  * For a healthy work-life balance: train with Wellpass in over 6000 sports and health facilities all over Germany
  * Eating makes you happy: We'll give you a monthly allowance of â‚¬108,45 for your daily lunch (easily via app).
  * For a relaxed commute to work: We reimburse you for public transport costs
  * One less thing to worry about: we'll cover some of your childcare costs
  * Whether online or offline - team cohesion and joint events are part of our everyday working life
  * A stylish working environment in our offices either in Munich or in Berlin 
  * For a secure future: the opportunity to take out a company pension scheme through us
