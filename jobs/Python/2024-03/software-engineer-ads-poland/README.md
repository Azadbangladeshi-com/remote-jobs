We are committed to our values, and as a remote-first team, we operate out of hubs within the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Germany today.

Weâ€™re innovating in the fast-paced world of live auctions in categories including sports, fashion, video games, and streetwear. The platform couples rigorous seller vetting with a focus on community to create a welcoming space for buyers and sellers to share their passions with others.

And, weâ€™re growing. Whatnot has been the fastest growing marketplace in the US over the past two years and weâ€™re hiring forward-thinking problem solvers across all functional areas.

#### ðŸ’» Role

Ads is a growing engineering team at Whatnot that is dedicated to building systems & features to help Sellers grow their business. As a software engineer on the Ads team, the most important qualities you'll need are making sound product decisions, navigating new domains seamlessly, taking extreme ownership, and shipping high-quality products fast. We always prioritize the highest impact features and ship them quickly. The software team has a lot of individual responsibility and many more freedoms, so we need to hire people we can trust. Your ability to put customers first, make good trade-offs and deliver impact is essential to us.

In this role, you will:
