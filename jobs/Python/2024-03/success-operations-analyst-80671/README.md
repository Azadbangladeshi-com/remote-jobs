### What do we do?

Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to their payment infrastructure.

That means we take away 100% of the pain of payment fragmentation. Itâ€™s faster, safer, cheaper, and, above all, way better.

Weâ€™re backed by investors including KKR, FTV Capital, Kindred, Notion, and 83North and serve over 3000 software sellers in 245 territories globally.

  * Analyse complex data sets to extract actionable insights, develop dashboards and reporting tools for real-time business performance and market trends analysis, and support data-driven decision-making.

  * Foster a culture of continuous improvement by encouraging innovation, experimentation, and learning within the Operations team.

### We'd love to hear from you:
