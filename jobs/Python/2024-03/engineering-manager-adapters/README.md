 **Who we are**

At dbt Labs, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics.

Specifically, we believe that:

  * Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic
  * Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers
  * Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software
  * Analytic code itself â€” not just analytics tools â€” will increasingly be open source

It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Today, there are 30,000 companies using dbt every week, 100,000 dbt Community members, and 4,100 companies paying for dbt Cloud. Our customers include JetBlue, Hubspot, Vodafone New Zealand, and Dunelm. dbt is synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry. Weâ€™re backed by top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Altimeter.
