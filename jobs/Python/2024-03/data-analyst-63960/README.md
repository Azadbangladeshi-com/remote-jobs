### MissionWired  
#### `ðŸ’° 165000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

At MissionWired, we help our partners create revolutionary fundraising strategies that advance their mission, change our country, and have a positive impact on the world.

MissionWired is the only wholly integrated direct marketing agency for nonprofits and Democratic organizations. We help our partners tell big, ambitious stories that invite their supporters into communities to raise mission-changing revenue. Our results are unrivaled, having converted more than $3.1 billion in donations to the worldâ€™s most trusted philanthropies and groundbreaking campaigns. We do it over email and SMS, in the mail, across social media, everywhere. We donâ€™t think in terms of channels; weâ€™re single-minded in pursuit of your success.

Weâ€™re innovative, progress-obsessed, do-gooders who care deeply about social change and continuing to push the limits on what we can accomplish together. Weâ€™ve brought strategies to life for nonprofit organizations working around the world, including Sandy Hook Promise, Human Rights Watch, The Humane Society of the U.S., Save the Children, and Friends of the Earth, as well as progressive political organizations, campaigns and candidates like President Bidenâ€™s re-election campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC). Each cycle is an opportunity for us to support organizations across the country and elect Democrats to legislative bodies up and down the ballot.

Weâ€™re an equal-opportunity employer and take seriously our commitment to equality and equity. Our efforts to be inclusive and create opportunity donâ€™t end when someone joins us â€“ they begin.

Weâ€™ve set our sights on changing the world through our work and with our clients, and representation is at the foundation of what we do. We know that diversity of thought and background makes us stronger. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re committed to building and maintaining a diverse community.

Every new team member broadens our perspective and allows us to think bigger. Weâ€™ll be at our best when people from underrepresented communities and people with a range of perspectives and lived experiences want to come, stay, and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
