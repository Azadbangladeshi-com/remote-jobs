### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### About the team

The mission of our Video team is to enhance our platform's video capabilities by deriving insights from video content and user interactions. This team sits within the Design Experience Supergroup, focusing on optimising video features for better engagement. By working closely with the Product and Engineering teams, we aim to make Canva the go-to platform for video design and editing.

The remit of our team is diverse - we have supported Canva leadership on various video-centric initiatives. Examples include â€˜How can we improve video content discovery on Canva?â€™, â€˜What video editing features increase user retention?â€™, â€˜How can we use AI to enhance video creation?â€™ and â€˜Which video trends should we integrate into Canva?â€™ - amongst many more!

Weâ€™re thrilled to continue driving significant impact on video-focused initiatives in 2024.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.  
  
In this Data Scientist role, you will work alongside product, design, and engineering to innovate and develop new video-centric features and analytics. You will be part of a rapidly evolving team dedicated to the video editing experience and bringing new dimensions to designing within Canva

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Uncovering insights that enhance our understanding of Canva's video capabilities and user interactions, going beyond conventional metrics to discover what truly resonates.
  * Designing and conducting experiments that significantly impact our video metrics and visibly influence user engagement and retention.
  * Creating and maintaining dashboards for our video product teams, ensuring they are both functional and visually appealing.
  * Managing projects, data models, dashboards, and other artefacts, maintaining high quality in a fast-paced environment.
  * Leveraging our extensive databases to explore complex video-related questions that are challenging yet rewarding.
  * Promoting data literacy and fostering a culture of curiosity about data across Canva.

### You're probably a match if

  * You have strong competency with SQL. Experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
  * You are experienced with data wrangling and analyzing data using Python or R.
  * You can demonstrate skills across optimising product funnels, running experiments, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes.
  * You may have a grounding in mathematics/statistics and a bachelor's degree in a STEM area (not mandatory).
  * You may have played with very large data sets (not mandatory).
  * You are a strong communicator, verbally and written, with the ability able to break down complex topics into simple solutions and ideas.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.
