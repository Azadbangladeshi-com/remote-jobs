**About Badal.io**

We are a boutique, rapidly growing, GCP (Google Cloud Platform) consulting company based out of Toronto.

Clients usually engage us to solve their most challenging business problems and help raise the bar at their organization.

  

 **Why Badal?**

You get the best of both worlds. We operate like an early-stage startup with all the associated benefits (e.g., talent, growth, learning opportunities, flexibility), but get to solve enterprise-level technical challenges.

â€¢ GCP is the Best Cloud: Maybe we are biased, but GCP is the most cutting-edge cloud provider, building on technologies that have been pioneered by Google: BigQuery, K8s/Anthos, Vertex AI, etc.

â€¢ Growth: We have doubled in size in the last 6 months, and are looking to double again this year.

â€¢ Work with business stakeholders to understand their needs

â€¢ Work with Data Scientists to derive information from data and provide the business with better decision making tools

â€¢ Support clients in troubleshooting issues in their test and/or production environments and identifying the root cause and solutions

  

 **You have**

â€¢ BI experience. SAS, Looker, Qlik and Power BI etc.

â€¢ Good knowledge of SQL and DBT

â€¢ Experience designing data models and building data structures (i.e. Product Required Documents on collecting data, cross-functional work with engineers)

â€¢ Excellent verbal and written communication skills, including the ability to communicate complex findings in a structured and clear manner to a non-technical audience

â€¢ Technical writing, experience in preparing and presenting technical material to a variety of audiences

â€¢ Experience in working in, and with, Agile delivery teams

  

 **Nice to have**

â€¢ Proficiency with statistical data analysis (a/b tests, hypothesis testing, experiment setting, etc.)

 **Type of qualities we look for (across all roles)**
