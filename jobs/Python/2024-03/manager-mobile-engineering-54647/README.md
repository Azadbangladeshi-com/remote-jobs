We‚Äôre looking for a Mobile Engineering Manager with 2+ years of experience leading iOS and Android engineers as their direct manager to join our growing mobile engineering organization.

Hiring and retaining top talent is a key aspect of this role. You‚Äôll help determine who to hire to ensure your team‚Äôs success, as well as how to reward top performers and coach individuals to do their best work.

Your sphere of influence doesn‚Äôt end there. Passionate and opinionated about things like new and emerging technologies, organizational theory, process, and execution? You‚Äôll be able to help define the what and the how around mobile engineering for our organization.

In short, you‚Äôll be a leader and a force multiplier, and with that, you‚Äôll shape how millions of people shop for their next car on iOS and Android.
