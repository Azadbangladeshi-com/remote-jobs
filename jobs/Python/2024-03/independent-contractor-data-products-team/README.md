# [Independent Contractor, Data Products Team](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/independent-contractor-data-products-team)  
### 60 Decibels  
#### `ðŸŒŽ India,Kenya,United Kingdom`  

60 Decibels is a tech-powered impact measurement company that makes it easy to listen to the people who matter most. We've been in business as an independent entity since early 2019, when we spun out of the global Impact Investor Acumen.

We believe that the best way to understand social impact is by talking to the people experiencing that impact. It sounds obvious when you say it, but that is not the typical practice for many impact investors, corporations and foundations working to create social change.

We collect social impact data directly from beneficiaries (customers / employees / suppliers) using our network of 1000+ trained research assistants in 75+ countries. We do it quickly and without the fuss typically associated with measuring social impact. Our research assistants speak directly to customers to understand their lived experience; and our team turns all this data into benchmarked social performance reports, with accompanying insights, to help our clients demonstrate and improve social performance.

By making impact measurement simple, scalable, and comparable, we not only enable organizations to improve their products and services; we also help transform what it means to credibly measure impact, ensuring that the voices of those who matter most are always part of the story.

 **If you're similarly passionate about our mission and excited about the opportunity to help grow a dynamic business, we're looking for an Independent Contractor to support our Data Products team.**

 **About the role: The Independent Contractor, Data Data Products Team will join our data products team for approximately 2-3 months to support data cleaning and improve our data architecture. The role is expected to be about 20 hours per week.**

We are a fast-growing, mission-driven, B2B company working with the worldâ€™s leading impact investors, companies, foundations and non-profits who are looking to create positive social impact.

Specifically, your responsibilities will include:

  * Clean up data to ensure it is accurate, standardized and usable for data products and benchmarks.
  * Build smart filters to keep our data quality high from the get-go.
  * Document our data processes in a way that's easy for anyone to follow.
  * Get hands-on with data, preparing it for analysis that informs important decisions.

 **About You:** First and foremost, you bring compassion and dedication to this work because it matters to you.

You have strong quantitative skills, and you are looking to use them for social good. You love data and are happy to get into the details of coding and cleaning. You are a self-starterâ€“when you identify something that needs to be done, you figure out a way to make it happen.

Other characteristics that will help you succeed in this role and be a great cultural fit: you have a bias towards actionâ€”you get your hands dirtyâ€”and you actively tackle problems in ways that lead to great outcomes. You successfully balance flexibility and rigor, and embrace taking strategic risks and growing from mistakes. Ultimately, you are eager to do the work to build something new and (we hope) important to the world.

We also expect that most candidates will have had the following experiences / attributes. If your experience set differs, but you think youâ€™re the right person for the job, say that in your application.

  * Advanced proficiency in Excel, Python/SQL proficiency preferred
  * Excellent analytical and problem solving skills, statistical skills preferred
  * Experience with CAPI or CATI survey data analysis and management
  * Strong attention to detail
  * Robust communication and interpersonal skills
  * Ability to work collaboratively with a team
  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics, economics, or a related field strongly preferred
  * Background in data analytics or data science strongly preferred

 **Compensation** : 60 Decibels offers a competitive salary and benefits package and the opportunity to work in a flexible, fun and supportive environment. The salary range will be adjusted according to costs of living in our country offices.

  * London: GBP 3,000 per month
  * Nairobi: KES 150,000 per month
  * Bangalore: INR 1,00,000 per month

 **About our team and our culture:** we are a fun and hardworking global team that is full of smart, mission-driven folks who combine an entrepreneurial spirit with a commitment to make a positive change in the world.

We consistently hear from our clients that the best thing about 60 Decibels is the people. To get a feel for our slightly nerdy, not-take-ourselves-too-seriously vibe, check out our monthly newsletter, The Volume.

 **Extra Perks:** Please note these benefits are only offered to full time employees. We have an unlimited leave policy and a monthly recharge day, on the first Friday of each month. We are a globally distributed team and youâ€™ll get the chance to work with colleagues from around the world.
