#### `ðŸŒŽ Australia`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Owniing and uplifting our data-centric approach in Discovery. Your primary objective will be to harness data to provide Discovery group leadership with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions that drive the direction of the group.

  * Developing and implementing a strategy that enables data capabilities and literacy across the Discovery group, with a view to drive the group to self-serve data needs.

  * Coaching a team of data science leads, and lead a broader group of data scientists and analytics engineers. You'll act as a driver of data strategy in this group and will coordinate closely with the Discovery leadership team. 

  * Working closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that the team's data strategies align with the broader goals of the group.

  * Closely collaborating with senior leadership and taking the initiative to keep things moving - identifying the opportunities where data can make the largest impact and see it through.

### You're probably a match if:

  * You have demonstrable experience leading data specialists, defining team strategy and data roadmaps.

  * You've got experience working with subscription-based data sets and experience with collaborative products.

  * You have exceptional competency with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!

  * You know how to wrangle and analyze data using Python or R.

  * You have experience with optimizing product funnels, running experiments, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes.

  * You have experience in Information Retrieval, recommender, ads or ranking systems/products.

### About the team

As a core part of the broader Discovery group, we are responsible for the AI, Machine Learning, Infrastructure, and User Experience that powers Canvaâ€™s discovery experience. We're building a highly personalized Canva; developing and productionising user modelling that directly drives product features and targeting messaging and marketing; making it easy for users to discover over 100M+ templates, photos, videos and elements; applying ML to label and transform a vast number and variety of images; and leveraging our unique design data to empower users to design.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too

  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers

  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more

  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
