Fathom is on a mission to use AI to understand and structure the worldâ€™s medical data, starting by making sense of the terabytes of clinician notes contained within the electronic health records of the worldâ€™s largest health systems. Our deep learning engine automates the translation of patient records into the billing codes used for healthcare provider reimbursement, a process today that costs hospitals in the US $15B+ annually and tens of billions more in errors and denied claims. We are a venture-backed company that completed a Series B round of financing for $46M in late 2022.

Are you passionate about machine learning and looking for an opportunity to make an impact in healthcare? We are seeking an extraordinary **Software Engineer, Machine Learning** based remotely in North America, who can not only design machine-based systems, but also think creatively about the human interactions necessary to augment and train those systems. We want to work with teammates excited about taking ground-breaking technologies and techniques to apply to one of the most important and most archaic industries. This is an opportunity to join our team and mission to understand and structure the worldâ€™s medical data, starting by making sense of the terabytes of clinician notes contained within the electronic health records of health systems.

### Your role and responsibilities will include:

  * Developing NLP systems that help us structure and understand biomedical information and patient records
  * Using a variety of structured and unstructured data sources
  * Imagining and implementing creative data-acquisition and labeling systems, using tools and techniques like crowdsourcing and novel active learning approaches
