### About Climate Arc

Climate Arc (Arc) is a philanthropic organization working to accelerate corporate climate action by unlocking the trillions of dollars of private capital required to meet global climate targets. We ensure that financial decision makers have the tools, data and skillsets needed to direct capital to the right solutions at speed and scale. Arc implements its strategy through grantmaking and through a range of research and tools delivered by our in-house analysts and researchers.

### About the opportunity

Arc is seeking an experienced Policy Lead to connect Arcâ€™s work, which focuses on climate transitions in the private sector, with critical developments on relevant policy and regulatory processes.

Reporting to the Director, Research & Program, this exciting, newly created role will play a critical part in the climate finance ecosystem by strengthening linkages between private sector transition plans and relevant policy and regulatory processes. The latter include, for instance, the International Sustainability Standards Board, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and regulators in key markets (working with Arc partners).

A strong understanding of the how the climate community is working towards enhanced policies and regulation for climate change will be important to this role, ideally complemented with a familiarity with how transition plans are being developed by the private sector (work that is guided by voluntary or mandatory frameworks).

At the technical level, the role will have a significant focus on sector/region scenarios and transition pathways, which are used to inform policy guidance as well as to assess individual companies (as well as countries) against science-based pathways. The role will also identify opportunities to incorporate information on policy developments into corporate transition analysis which are provided to financial decision makers.

The focus will be to unlock financing of net zero transition by identifying key policy and regulatory interventions. This role will note be expected to directly engage with policy makers or regulators to influence them, but instead, forging strong relationships with advocacy organisations to shape policies and regulations. We want to ensure that Arc is providing critical information and analysis to our partners, so that collectively we can build capacity and push for polices that advance the climate transition.

### What you will be doing:

  * Developing Arcâ€™s strategy for policy and regulatory engagement and forging strong relationships with key partners 
  * Ensuring Arc understands and responds to financiersâ€™ needs, in particular on policy and regulatory measures that impact Arcâ€™s outputs 
  * Leading Arcâ€™s efforts to ensure relevant sector-region pathways are available and incorporated into our wider work 
  * Develop, manage and implement complex research assignments and analytical projects, showcasing financing solutions and innovations 
  * Maintain collaborative relationships with our partners and grantees â€“ engaging and advising on research and analysis findings â€“ to collectively build capacity on the nexus of private and public financing and policy interventions 
  * Build and maintain a range of relevant sectoral knowledge and information resources to enable the community to access high quality intelligence, analysis, and data to inform current and future programme activity. 

### Requirements

### The ideal candidate has:

### Required:

  * Commitment to Arcâ€™s vision and mission 
  * Extensive and progressive experience working in a private or public financial institution or in public policy roles focused on climate finance 
  * Deep knowledge and understanding of trends in regulations and policy shifts and their implications on financing opportunities for climate safe solutions at the regional and global level 
  * Strong understanding of the how the climate community is working towards enhanced policies and regulation for climate change 
  * Demonstrated ability to manage relationships with key stakeholders, including government bodies, NGOs, and industry partners 
  * Experience managing complex research assignments and analytical projects 
  * Experience writing research-based reports with a focus on analytical research   

### Desirable:

  * Understanding of the challenges facing financial sector organisations in aligning with net zero and how the barriers can be unlocked 
  * Experience or understanding of the interplay and effect of central bank actions and regulation on banks and financial institutions 
  * Experience in analysing sector/region scenarios and transition pathways and climate/energy related data 
  * Familiarity with how transition plans are being developed by the private sector, supported by voluntary and mandatory disclosure frameworks 
  * Experience of public speaking on relevant topics 
  * Data skills such as data analysis, quantitative modelling, statistical analysis and programming, including in Python and SQL
