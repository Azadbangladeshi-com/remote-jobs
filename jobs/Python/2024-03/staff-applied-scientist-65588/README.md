We are looking for someone with deep expertise in applying scientific techniques to marketplace growth and marketing problems. Our challenges include building systems to optimize our marketing spend to bring more customers to the marketplace, targeting our pro and customer acquisition efforts to ensure better outcomes for customers and pros and healthy marketplace growth, and building personalized experiences to engage and retain our customers and professionals.
