### About Brilliant

Brilliant is making a world of great problem solvers. We focus on adults learning quantitative skills ‚Äì especially in math, data, and CS/AI ‚Äì and deliver a best-in-class interactive learning experience across web and apps. Our courses teach you what you need to know, while skipping the stuff you don‚Äôt ‚Äì so expect more about solving equations, statistical analysis, logical deduction, neural networks, and generative AI, and less about abstract theorems and integrating complicated trig functions.

We serve hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers, and we‚Äôre hoping you might be the right person to contribute to accelerating our footprint to millions of customers (and changed lives). In addition to what‚Äôs below, you can see all open roles and learn more about our team culture on our careers page.

We have always prioritized building a healthy business as the backbone of achieving our mission. We are default alive (will be profitable before needing to raise), have never had layoffs, are growing new customers at an exciting pace (high double-digits year-over-year). Our investors are top-tier + mission aligned, and we‚Äôve kept our valuations tethered to reality ‚Äì we aren‚Äôt playing ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù like many others.

In our day-to-day, we value adventure, excellence, generosity, and candor. We are optimists in the face of uncertainty, we take pride in our work, we go the extra mile for each other, and we tell it like it is (the good and the bad). We‚Äôre all here to do the best work of our lives together, and have a lot of fun along the way.

We believe that real-time collaboration and human connection are necessary ingredients in building a high-velocity, creatively-oriented consumer product. We maintain core hours (10am - 3pm Pacific) where everyone is online, regardless of timezone. Over half of us are located near our hubs in SF and NYC, and folks outside of those cities travel to attend team offsites once-per-quarter.

### The Role

As a **Senior Data Scientist** at Brilliant, you will drive product and business decisions through deep analytical insights and rigorous measurement. You will become an expert on our customers and product, empowering data-informed decision making in key initiatives. Above all, you‚Äôll help us develop the correct frameworks for understanding and accelerating the company‚Äôs growth.

### You are confident about...

  * Your ability to thrive in a fast-paced, often ambiguous work environment
  * Using data to make recommendations based on your findings
  * Working fast by default to produce actionable results in O(days) versus O(weeks), and slowing down when you sense elevated risk of a bad decision
  * Managing timelines efficiently and communicating when deadlines are at risk

### You are exceptional at...

  * Using advanced SQL for analysis and can leverage Python or R as needed
  * Analyzing consumer products, usage patterns, and funnels; experience with digital consumer products or gaming is highly desired
  * Storytelling by transforming data into effective and impactful visual insights (Tableau, Hex, Google Sheets)
  * Managing and prioritizing multiple work streams
  * Communicating (verbal, written, and presentations) and ability to establish relationships

### You are enthusiastic about...

  * Working cross-functionally with various business and engineering stakeholders
  * Contextualizing data to drive a deep understanding of Brilliant‚Äôs product and customers
  * Working relatively autonomously in a small team to produce big results
  * Seepening the ‚Äúdata + intuition‚Äù culture across the company
  * Taking initiative, being proactive, sharing ideas, and challenging the status quo

### Your responsibilities

  * Analyze large, complex event data representing millions of user interactions to address strategic and operational business questions
  * Build data products and analytical frameworks that facilitate understanding of key business metrics and users‚Äô experience
  * Become a subject-matter expert on our product and users, building a common understanding of how users are interacting with our product and features
  * Provide actionable insights and recommendations from experiment data to shape new features and future product roadmap
  * Work closely with product, content, and engineering to derive insights that will drive towards monetization and retention improvements
  * Contribute to our data pipeline and analytics infrastructure by building curated data models in Snowflake and dbt

### Compensation and Benefits

We use a systematic compensation framework: salary scales are set each year for each job vertical, managers level folks on their team, and those levels are mapped directly to our compensation scales. A location-based adjustment is applied outside of SF and NYC (typically 5-10%) - feel free to ask us about your location!

Given the systematic approach, we always make First and Best offers - there is no negotiation (for new hires nor our existing teammates). This ensures people are paid based on their expected contribution, not their negotiation skills.

We offer top-notch health care plans, with 100% of the premiums covered for medical, dental, and vision for employees. About 1/3 of our team are parents, and we provide generous parental leave + up to $1900/mo in dependent healthcare coverage.

We offer flexible PTO, with a norm of taking off about 6 weeks per year (including federal holidays). We also provide home office equipment, a professional development stipend, and free food at our offices.
