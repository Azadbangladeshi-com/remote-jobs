### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

 **Where and how you can work**

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

 **What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * The Development environment for vendors: Youâ€™ll architect, implement, and maintain a secure, scalable development environment that enables both internal engineers and external vendors to collaborate effectively. Youâ€™ll ensure the environment adheres to strict access controls and security standards.
  * Implementing shared Observability Tools: Youâ€™ll design and integrate comprehensive observability tools that provide real-time insights into application performance, aiding in quick diagnostics and resolution of issues. Youâ€™ll ensure these tools are accessible to both Canvaâ€™s internal team and external partners as appropriate.
  * Guiding CI/CD Pipeline Development: Youâ€™ll build and maintain Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to support efficient and reliable code deployment processes.
  * Collaboration and Support: Youâ€™ll work directly with external vendors to understand their development needs and challenges. Youâ€™ll provide technical support and guidance to help them migrate to the goal environment. Youâ€™ll help evangelise the vision and best practices of the infrastructure group to the engineers of the team.

 **You're probably a match if**

  * You are energized by the prospect of constructing a new platform from the ground up, with a keen focus on meeting both the team's and vendors' needs, while remaining cognizant of the overarching mission of the larger platform team.
  * You have a proven track record in developing secure, scalable infrastructure for software development, particularly in cloud environments.
  * You are proficient and happy to code in Python or Go.
  * You have strong knowledge of CI/CD and related technologies.
  * You have strong communication and collaborative skills, both written and verbal.
  * You are proficient with infrastructure-as-code, weâ€™re a Terraform shop, but strong experience with other IaC tools will do the trick.
  * You have a solid knowledge of AWS services such as ECS, EKS, Lambda, DynamoDB, RDS, S3 or equivalent Cloud provider experience.
  * You have experience with observability tools including (but not limited to) Datadog, Kibana, Prometheus, Grafana or OpenTelemetry.

 **About the team**

This role falls within the Ecosystem Group and their strategy is to invest in:

  1. Building integrations with enterprise tools and SaaS software so that our customers have seamless access to Canva within their day-to-day tools and workflows
  2. Building apps on Canva so our users can access the tools they need to design from within Canva

Examples of these strategic apps and integrations include Google Drive, Slack, Microsoft Teams and many moreâ€¦

The Partner Apps and Integrations team plays a vital role in the Ecosystem strategy by working closely with vendors to design and build a suite of marquee Apps and Integrations using our in-product App SDK and backend REST API (aka Connect API) that meet Canvaâ€™s engineering best practices.

As a member of the Partner Apps and Integrations team, you will be working closely with vendors and engineers to understand their issues to unblock them and improve their effectiveness.

 **What's in it for you?**

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
