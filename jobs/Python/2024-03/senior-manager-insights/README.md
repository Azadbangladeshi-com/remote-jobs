### About Harvest

Harvest is an industry-leading software company building tools that help businesses thrive. We believe companies succeed by using their time intentionally, and our products support our customers by helping them plan, track, and understand their teamsâ€™ time.

Harvest was created in 2006 by two small business owners who were looking for a way to manage and grow their web design agency in New York City. What started as a solution for their own company has since evolved into a business intelligence platform embraced by thousands of professional services firms across the world who share the same drive to grow thriving, sustainable businesses.

Harvest is an independent, profitable company. We donâ€™t have investors, shareholders, or a board of directors. Instead, our main drive is to serve the needs of our customers, so we put them at the forefront of every decision we make.

All of this is made possible by the incredible Harvest team. Our small but mighty workforce sits across 9 countries and 11 time zones, resulting in a rich working environment where diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and opinions inform every discussion and decision. We value self-discipline, scrappiness and a genuine curiosity to learn from one another. Motivated by excellence and collaboration, our people are the engine that fuels our success.
