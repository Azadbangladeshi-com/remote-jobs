### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Applying your product/platform mindset to define the Machine Learning and Python specialty roadmap for the group.
  * Actively participating in solution design meetings, hiring interviews, and code reviews.
  * Building and delivering solutions to improve the Python and Machine Learning engineering experience at Canva.
  * Constructing better tooling and metrics so that we, and our platform users, understand and can respond to the health of our systems.
  * Improving and updating documentation while defining best practices and guidelines for Python and ML engineering.
  * Mentoring and guiding other engineers, supporting their professional growth and development.

### You're probably a match if

  * You demonstrate self-motivation and a strong sense of ownership over complex problems and their solutions.
  * Youâ€™re passionate about engineering excellence, systems architecture, and non-functional requirements.
  * Youâ€™re focused on fostering team collaboration and achieving collective success through shared challenges.
  * You have solid expertise in Python development which is essential, and experience with modern development tools such as Bazel or Nix is a plus.
  * You have experience with containerization, Terraform and GitOps principles for automation and deployment is highly valued.
  * You have prior experience or willingness to learn about ML concepts and applications, with a strong desire to integrate ML capabilities into existing infrastructure.
  * While experience with ML frameworks such as pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Ray, and TensorRT is advantageous, it's considered a good-to-have rather than a strict requirement. Hands-on experience with CUDA as a platform operator is desirable.

### About the team

You'll be joining the Language Ecosystem team, whose mission is to uplift language and ecosystem support across Developer Platform products. Working directly with teams across the group, your role will focus on enhancing support for specific language-related workflows and delivering solutions that eliminate capability gaps.

As a Python Specialist on the Language Ecosystem team, you'll:

  * Collaborate closely with engineers across the organization to understand their requirements and jointly design platform infrastructure solutions with a strong emphasis on Python.
  * Work alongside Developer Platform product managers and leadership to define priorities and roadmap for ML and Python-related initiatives within the team.
  * Proactively engage with engineers across Developer Platform by seconding into teams and collaborating on projects to uplift Python and ML expertise. Provide hands-on guidance and servant leadership to empower teams in owning and operating platform products supporting Python and ML.

This role offers an exciting opportunity to drive innovation in Python and ML engineering practices and contribute to the development of a unified and resilient system architecture. If you're passionate about leveraging Python and ML technologies to solve complex problems and thrive in a collaborative environment, we'd love to hear from you.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
