### **What Youâ€™ll Do:**

As a member of Space Surveillance Research and Development (R&D) technical staff, you will support Slingshotâ€™s efforts to accelerate the security, safety, and sustainability of space via the design and development of optical systems capable of detecting resident space objects (RSOs) from low Earth orbit (LEO) to beyond geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). Depending on candidate skill sets and priorities, this work will include a subset of (i) designing optical sensing systems for space surveillance applications; (ii) development of software/hardware interfaces for ground- and space-based gimbaled and non-gimbaled optical systems, (iii) development of state-of-the-art detection, calibration, and mount control algorithms; (iv) modeling, simulation, and analysis of sensor network capabilities; and (v) development of robust software to autonomously operate remote observatories.

###  **Position Responsibilities**

  * Execute all position responsibilities in alignment with Slingshotâ€™s core values, mission, and purpose
  * Perform system-level design and integration of hardware to create cutting-edge optical space surveillance systems
  * Develop algorithms and software to help automate and enhance optical sensor data tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination
  * Support ongoing and future transitions of Slingshotâ€™s products and services to the Slingshot Global Sensor Network (SGSN), space operations centers, and other technology testbeds
  * Engage with customers and stakeholders to ensure successful outcomes for their mission-critical needs
  * Contribute your expertise and ideas to help shape our products and strategies
  * Prepare technical reports and briefing materials
  * Perform other duties as assigned (to be less than 10% of the responsibilities listed above)

### **Pre-Requisites**

  * Must be a U.S. citizen eligible for government security clearances

###  **Minimum Requirements**

  * Undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics (Optics), Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering or a related field
  * 5+ years of relevant work experience or a record of academic excellence with internship experience
  * Experience developing applications in Python and/or C++
  * Effective written and verbal communication skills, with the demonstrated ability to convey salient details about advanced technology in a compelling manner to both experts and non-experts alike
  * Ability to travel up to 5% of the time within and outside of the United States to support sensor installations
  * Tenacious drive to overcome challenges and deliver solutions with excellence

### **Preferred Skills**

  * Graduate level degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics (Optics), Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering or a related field
  * Significant experience developing and debugging applications in Python and/or C++ with deployment experience in a Linux operating environment
  * Experience in optics or mechanical system component design and assembly
  * Training or experience in fields such as image processing, algorithm optimization, software/hardware interfacing, embedded/GPU development, astrodynamics, estimation theory, statistical analysis, remote sensing, radiometry, and machine learning
  * Early-stage startup experience

*These skills are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. You donâ€™t have to meet every qualification listed- if your skills are transferable and you meet the minimum requirements, we encourage you to apply.
