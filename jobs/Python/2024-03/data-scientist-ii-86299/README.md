### Oscar  
#### `ðŸ’° 303400.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Hi, we're Oscar. We're hiring Data Scientists to join our team.

Oscar is the first health insurance company built around a full stack technology platform and a relentless focus on serving our members. We started Oscar in 2012 to create the kind of health insurance company we would want for ourselvesâ€”one that behaves like a doctor in the family.

Insurance companies sit on a trove of data that is both broad and deep, spanning financial claims, clinical medical records, and rich product interaction data from our members. Connecting the dots across these datasets gives us unique insight into how the healthcare system functions and allows us to improve care coordination, better manage risk, build higher-performing provider networks, and create a standout consumer experience.
