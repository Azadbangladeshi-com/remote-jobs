 _ **General Summary:**_

We are currently seeking a skilled ML Compiler Engineer to join our team. The ideal candidate will have expertise in Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), PyTorch, and a strong inclination towards applying compilation techniques to optimize Machine Learning (ML) graphs, drawing inspiration from GCC combiner/peephole optimization strategies. Additionally, knowledge of C++ meta-programming, Python meta-programming, affine quantization, and debugging ML workflows in hardware would be advantageous.

 **Responsibilities**

  * Develop and enhance compiler infrastructure specialized for machine learning frameworks, with a focus on PyTorch.
  * Utilize AST analysis and transformation methodologies to optimize the performance and efficiency of ML graphs.
  * Apply compilation techniques inspired by GCC combiner/peephole optimizations to streamline code generation and improve runtime performance.
  * Collaborate closely with research and engineering teams to understand optimization requirements and translate them into effective compiler strategies.
  * Work with ML graphs, optimizing their representation and execution for accelerated computation.
  * Implement and refine affine quantization techniques to improve model efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
  * Utilize C++ and Python meta-programming techniques to develop efficient compiler solutions.
  * Assist in debugging ML workflows on hardware platforms, identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.
  * Profile and analyze performance bottlenecks within ML workloads, proposing and implementing optimizations to address them.
  * Stay updated with the latest advancements in compiler technologies, machine learning frameworks, and hardware architectures to continuously improve our compiler infrastructure.

 **Requirements**

  * Bachelor's, Master's, or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related field.
  * Proficiency in PyTorch and experience with machine learning frameworks.
  * Strong understanding of AST manipulation techniques and compiler optimizations.
  * Knowledge of compilation techniques similar to GCC combiner/peephole optimizations.
  * Familiarity with ML graph representation and execution.
  * Experience in C++ and Python programming; knowledge of meta-programming techniques is beneficial.
  * Understanding of affine quantization techniques for model optimization.
  * Familiarity with hardware debugging tools and techniques.
  * Strong problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.
  * Excellent communication and teamwork abilities.

 _ **Minimum Qualifications:**_

â€¢ Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related field and 6+ years of Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Systems Engineering, or related work experience.  
OR  
Master's degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related field and 5+ years of Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Systems Engineering, or related work experience.
