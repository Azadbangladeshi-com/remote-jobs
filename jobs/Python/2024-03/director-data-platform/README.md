### What we‚Äôre building

Did you know that 50M+ people in the US drive a personal car for work - and qualify for an average tax deduction of $6,500? But to get it, you have to keep a log of every single drive you take (and keep it for 5 years in case you‚Äôre audited!).

At MileIQ, we‚Äôre delivering mileage tracking for the modern workforce. We are the category creator and global leader in mileage tracking, with 1M+ active users, 80B+ miles logged, and $10B+ in value.

### Why we‚Äôre doing it

We started this business a decade ago - then we sold it to Microsoft - and then we bought it back.

Why? Because we still believe in the vision of making mileage tracking a delightful and universal tool for every person who drives for work. Now we‚Äôre going all-in on building an even better product, brand, and user experience.

We act like a startup, but we are mindful that our service is relied upon everyday to capture tens of millions of valuable miles. We love to build, test and learn.
