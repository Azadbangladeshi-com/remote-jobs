### About the role:

As a Sales Engineer at Samsara, youâ€™d be part of a diverse group of technically minded folks working together to bring our unique connected operations technology to customers. Our daily customer engagements include conversations around logistics/supply chain management, fleet maintenance strategies, global asset management, machine control systems/diagnostics, system integration, and regulatory compliance. This means a successful SE at Samsara will develop a thorough understanding of IoT hardware and sensors, hands-on installation/deployment scenarios, carrier networks, cloud infrastructure, and third-party system integrations (via our open API) to ensure the proper technical solution is presented to our customers.

### You should apply if:

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** Your efforts will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  *  **You have innate curiosity in how businesses work:** One day youâ€™ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact. 
  * **You build genuine relationships with your customers:** The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and havenâ€™t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.
  *  **You want to be with the best:** Samsaraâ€™s high-performance culture means youâ€™ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before. 
  * **You are a team player:** At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.
