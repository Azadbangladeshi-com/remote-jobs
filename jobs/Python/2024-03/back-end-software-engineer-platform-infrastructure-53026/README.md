### Seesaw  
#### `ðŸ’° 294000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### About Us:

Trusted and loved by 25 million educators, students, and families worldwide, Seesaw is the only elementary learning experience platform, offering a suite of award-winning tools, resources, and curriculum for teachers to deliver joyful, inclusive instruction. Through interactive lessons, digital portfolios, and two-way communication features, Seesaw keeps everyone in the learning loop by providing continuous visibility into the student's learning experience to support and celebrate their learning.

### Our Mission:

Seesawâ€™s mission is to provide every elementary student with joyful and connected learning experiences that lay the foundation for success in life.

### Your Team:

This Software Engineer will join our Core Platform team, a back-end team functioning as the backbone of our organization, dedicated to crafting and maintaining the fundamental infrastructure and service libraries that drive Seesaw's success. By constructing the foundational layers upon which all other product teams build, they empower rapid and scalable development of exceptional user experiences. Additionally, the Core Platform team assumes ownership of critical operational aspects, including security, reliability, and cost-effectiveness to ensure the seamless operation of Seesaw's platform and cloud infrastructure. This is a force multiplier team with a wide breadth of exposure, and contributes directly to the success of the organization.

Solving impactful problems on Seesawâ€™s Engineering team feels different from any other place. First, we are given lots of ownership over the product roadmap early on, collaborating on how and when things will be built from the start. Second, we have a strong connection to the user, listening to teacher feedback and observing how students and families interact with the platform in real life to iterate over our releases. And third, we enjoy ample autonomy to experiment and grow, and often see our ideas pushed to production in weeks, not months.

Globally, millions of children rely on Seesaw every day. That fact is inspiring, and at times, daunting. While we derive a deep sense of purpose from being able to improve studentsâ€™ learning, it also means weâ€™re emotionally invested in both the successes and failures. So when a child canâ€™t log into their account or something on the platform breaks, we feel it.

Like the rest of the company, our team is growing fast. Keeping up with the pace of growth can be challenging, and we need your flexibility as we define and refine what we need to be. We often learn by shipping, so you wonâ€™t find an obsession with rigid processes here. As the Engineering team ramps up hiring, weâ€™re committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); constantly surveying employees, participating in training, and learning from our DEI Committee.

Though we care deeply and work diligently, thereâ€™s no extra credit for working long nights or spending weekends squashing bugs. When weâ€™re off, weâ€™re really off, enjoying our personal lives and recharging our batteries.

At the end of the day, we delight in how much our users adore our product. Itâ€™s incredibly fulfilling to read thank you tweets from teachers and know that, hey, we built something that makes a meaningful impact! And while we saw massive growth during the pandemic, weâ€™ve still got a lot more growing to do. Joining our team now means youâ€™ll get to help us take on new markets and innovate the next features that make the learning experience even better.
