### Circle  
#### `ðŸ’° 342500.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Circle is a financial technology company at the epicenter of the emerging internet of money, where value can finally travel like other digital data â€” globally, nearly instantly and less expensively than legacy settlement systems. This ground-breaking new internet layer opens up previously unimaginable possibilities for payments, commerce and markets that can help raise global economic prosperity and enhance inclusion. Our infrastructure â€“ including USDC, a blockchain-based dollar â€“ helps businesses, institutions and developers harness these breakthroughs and capitalize on this major turning point in the evolution of money and technology.

### What youâ€™ll be part of:

Circle is committed to visibility and stability in everything we do. As we grow as an organization, we're expanding into some of the world's strongest jurisdictions. Speed and efficiency are motivators for our success and our employees live by our company values: Multistakeholder, Mindfulness, Driven by Excellence and High Integrity. Circlers are consistently evolving in a remote world where strength in numbers fuels team success. We have built a flexible and diverse work environment where new ideas are encouraged and everyone is a stakeholder.

### What youâ€™ll be responsible for:

USDC isnâ€™t a monolith. It lives in a broad ecosystem with multiple participants: developers, blockchains, applications, exchanges, traders, individuals, and protocols (just to name a few). We need to understand how USDC is being used, by whom, and how it moves in order to make the best products possible and make sure that the people who use USDC are well served. This is a critical role that will help us understand who is holding USDC, how it got to them, and how USDC moves around the broader crypto ecosystem. This role will be critical to how we make decisions across the company (product, engineering, business development, marketing, compliance, etc).

### What you'll work on:

  * Maintaining labels and tags for onchain addresses: Develop and implement systems and processes to accurately label and tag onchain addresses, ensuring the integrity of data used in various analyses.
  * Conducting deep investigations of blockchain flows and transactions: Analyze and investigate blockchain transactions, including traceability, authenticity, and identification of potential risks or anomalies.
  * Analyzing movement of capital on blockchains, with a focus on Stablecoins: Study capital movement within blockchain networks, particularly focusing on Stablecoin usage and flow, including cross chain movement. This analysis will help identify patterns, trends, and potential opportunities or risks.
  * Keeping up with Blockchain research: Work closely with Blockchain Researchers across Circle to share insights and collaborate on transaction tracing, blockchain forensics, network analysis, and anomaly detection. This collaboration will help uncover deeper insights, identify fraudulent activity, improve security, and enhance compliance procedures.

### You will aspire to our four core values:

  *  **Multistakeholder -** you have dedication and commitment to our customers, shareholders, employees and families and local communities.
  *  **Mindful -** you seek to be respectful, an active listener and to pay attention to detail.
  *  **Driven by Excellence -** you are driven by our mission and our passion for customer success which means you relentlessly pursue excellence, that you do not tolerate mediocrity and you work intensely to achieve your goals.
  *  **High Integrity -** you seek open and honest communication, and you hold yourself to very high moral and ethical standards. You reject manipulation, dishonesty and intolerance.

### What youâ€™ll bring to Circle:

  * 5+ years of experience in data analysis or data science, with 2+ years focusing on blockchain data.
  * Proficiency in SQL and at least one programming language, such as R or Python, for data manipulation and analysis.
  * Strong understanding of statistics and experience applying statistical methods to interpret blockchain data.
  * Proven experience in planning and driving analytical projects.
  * Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, with attention to detail.
  * Strong communication skills to convey complex findings and insights to both technical and non-technical partners.

 **Strong preference for candidates with deep knowledge and/or experience in:**

  * Blockchain transaction analysis and the ability to conduct thorough investigations.
  * Blockchain technologies and protocols (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin).
  * Blockchain research methods, including transaction tracing, network analysis, and anomaly detection.
  * Blockchain analytics tools and platforms (e.g., Arkham, TRM Labs, Chainalysis, Elliptic)
  * Maintaining labels and tags for onchain addresses.
  * Stablecoin mechanics and practical knowledge of analyzing their movement on blockchains.

Join us as a Blockchain Data Scientist to unlock the potential of blockchain data and contribute to the growth and security of our organization in this constantly evolving space.
