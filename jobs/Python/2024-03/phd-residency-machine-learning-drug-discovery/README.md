### **Ready to join the AQ era?**

SandboxAQ is solving challenging problems with AI + Quantum for positive impact. We partner with global leaders in government, academia, and the private sector to identify applications that would benefit from quantum-based applications to current and future commercial challenges. We engage with customers early and throughout the development process to improve market fit.

Our teamâ€™s unique approach enables cross-pollination across a diverse range of fields, from physics, computer science, neuroscience, mathematics, cryptography, natural sciences and more! Our success comes from coalescing diverse talent to create an environment where experimental thinking and collaboration yield breakthrough AI + Quantum solutions. Join a culture where thought leadership, diverse talent, employee engagement, and technological impact will create the next tech uproar.

We are deeply committed to education as a means to advance quantum solutions and computing initiatives. We invest in future talent through internship programs, research papers, developer tools, textbooks, educational talks/events and partnerships with universities/talent hubs to attract multi-disciplinary talent. Our hope is to inspire people from all walks of life to be prepared for the quantum era and encourage a path in STEM.

### Residencies at SandboxAQ

The SandboxAQ Residency Program is an excellent, paid opportunity for graduate students to have industrial impact. Residents work within all of the teams at SandboxAQ on a variety of projects, and each have a unique experience depending on the work their team is focused on, as well as their own interests, skills, and goals. During their time with the program, we encourage residents to contribute to publications, attend conferences, and pursue their professional development. In addition to technical work, community is very important to us and we provide space and events to network and socialize with others in the program, as well as the SandboxAQ community as a whole.

### AQBioSIm Team Charter

The AQBioSim team develops AI and quantum solutions for computational science, with a near-term focus on drug design. We seek revolutionary impact on human health, the environment, and the economy. AQBioSim Residents will develop and implement novel physics-based, AI, quantum, and quantum-inspired algorithms for drug design and beyond. Working closely with a focused team of PhDs, MBAs, engineers, and product experts, you will confront hard social problems, make business impact, and improve lives.
