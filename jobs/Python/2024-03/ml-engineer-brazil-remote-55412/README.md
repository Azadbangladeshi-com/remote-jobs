The AI team  
The main goal of the AI Team is to leverage AI and ML to provide high-quality clinical care at unprecedented levels of personalization and scale. In this regard, in close collaboration with the clinical team, we develop ML-powered features that identify the best course of action for each patient at any given moment or circumstance whilst employing a holistic perspective but also contemplating any relevant nuance. We also work on ensuring the overall experience is as close as possible to a 1:1 session with a Physical Therapist and thus play a crucial role in enabling the AI Care provided by Sword.  
Some examples of the work we did so far include a decision support system for managing clinical prescriptions, a classification system that identifies people in need of assistance, and a system that enhances the Physical Therapist context when communicating with the patient. To achieve this, we work with tabular and text data using a combination of classical methods and more recent models (such as LLMs).  
As for the near future, our focus will be on taking the degree of personalization and human touch of our AI care to a whole new level by leveraging the most recent developments in the Generative AI field.
