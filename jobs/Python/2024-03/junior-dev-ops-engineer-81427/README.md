### Our Story

Small and medium size businesses are the lifeblood of the economy. Around the world, they supply vital goods and valuable services. Powering partnerships, increasing innovation, and driving progress.

But when it comes to getting hold of cash, these businesses frequently suffer. Credit and working capital is expensive and difficult to access. It causes existential turmoil and huge emotional distress. Growth is restricted, and economies suffer as a result.

Thatâ€™s why we started Previse. We use advanced machine learning and AI with rich business data, to predict future revenue probability. This decision making capability is used to re-invent finance solutions for businesses.

Previse is building the infrastructure to connect millions of businesses with billions of dollars of finance, in ways that are otherwise not possible.

This is smarter finance, driven by data. Helping cash flow so businesses can grow.
