## Job Description:

About the role:

  
You will be part of Intel Advanced Design Organization (AD) within Design Enablement (DE) focused on pathfinding and development of advanced logic circuits to enable best-in-class Foundational IP collateral and product design across all generations of Intel process technology. You will help develop new capabilities for design automation and optimization using scalable software and AI/ML to improve overall design PPA (Power Performance and Area). This work requires exploration of latest AI/ML algorithms, with senior engineers, for solving challenges in design optimization space and build proof of concept (PoC) capabilities. You will be expected to research and develop advanced AI/ML strategies to build or extend state of the art in the field of digital design optimization.  
  
To excel in this role, you should be passionate about physical design, software development, solving challenging problems, and exploring cutting-edge technologies for design optimization using AI/ML techniques. You'll be part of Advanced Design (AD) within Design Enablement organization (DE). The team works in close collaboration with various partners in process technology and design teams spanning CPU, GPU and Server SoCs. The primary focus of the team is to quickly and accurately predict the impact of process changes on power, performance, and area (PPA) to facilitate data-based decisions for PPA commits for future Intel processes.

This is a fulltime internship for 6-9 months.
