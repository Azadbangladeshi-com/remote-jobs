### About the role:

We are looking for a Chief of Staff to work directly with our Head of Product. We're looking for someone who is extremely ambitious, curious and hungry to make a big impact in the lives of our customers. You are someone who possess both a high level of customer empathy and an analytical mindset. You're analytically independent, but don't focus on the numbers alone. You know that to understand the full picture, you have to talk to users, to dig into the nitty gritty of our processes, to fix and improve our product, services, etc. You are resourceful and aren't afraid to push yourself outside of your comfort zone to solve a problem. In this position, you'll be the Head of Product's right hand person that he'll lean on heavily to clue find and clue fix across the organization (within and outside of Product). No job is beneath you, and you know that speed of execution and innovation are key to winning. You hope to wear many hats, and you'll likely start a company of your own one day.
