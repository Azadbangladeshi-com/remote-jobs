Our team is also interested in business problems - building things reliably, efficiently and cost-effectively, and we have to learn to speak the language of our customers and their industries.

We help global companies embrace public and private cloud infrastructure, cloud native operations, and open source applications.

You will support various alliances and partners of Canonical to adopt our products and technologies, help business leaders to define joint go-to-market programs with partners from the technical standpoint.

We often say that our field engineers have 'the hardest job at Canonical' because customers can ask about any aspect of our solutions and products and expect a thoughtful, well-informed answer. We always want to do the best thing for our partners and customers, regardless of our company interests, and field engineers are the people we trust to ensure that is true.
