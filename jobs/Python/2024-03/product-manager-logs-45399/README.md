#### About the role

As the Product Manager for Logs, your primary goal is to enhance the utility and functionality of Cloudflare Logs â€” ensuring that they deliver actionable insights about both Cloudflare's services and the customer's own infrastructure.

You will have immediate responsibility for the Logpush product, which helps customers push raw logs to their destination of choice. Youâ€™ll be responsible for bringing our new storage and search offering, Logs Explorer, from beta to GA â€” growing customers, usage and revenue. Youâ€™ll also be responsible for Instant Logs, which helps users get real-time insight into their traffic. While your main goal is to serve Cloudflareâ€™s end-users, youâ€™ll also work with other product teams at Cloudflare to onboard new datasets and make sure these products have strong adoption internally.

#### Key Responsibilities

  * Ownership of Logpush and Logs Explorer: You will be responsible for the end-to-end management of these tools, from conceptualization to deployment, and ongoing enhancement.
  * Customer Engagement: Engage directly with customers to deeply understand their needs. You will be the voice of the customer within Cloudflare, ensuring that our logs products are continuously evolving to meet their requirements.
  * Product Strategy and Vision: Define and drive the strategic direction for Cloudflare's logs products, aligning with broader company objectives and customer needs.
  * Cross-Functional Leadership: Collaborate with engineering, design, marketing, sales, and support teams to deliver an integrated product experience.
  * Data-Driven Decision Making: Utilize data analytics to inform product decisions and measure the impact of new features and improvements.
  * Market Analysis: Keep abreast of industry trends and competitor activities to ensure Cloudflare remains a leader in cloud connectivity and security.

#### Key Competencies

In this role, youâ€™ll be responsible for building and delivering brand-new products. Weâ€™re not expecting to hire a domain expert (though background knowledge is a plus!) â€” we want to find someone who is curious, can learn quickly, think creatively, and lead the engineering team while working cross-functionally.

  * Strong qualitative and quantitative reasoning skills. You can synthesize customer feedback with hard data about product usage.
  * Prior experience delivering software products â€” whether as a student, intern, developer, analyst or product manager.
  * Exceptional communication skills. Youâ€™re able to speak with ease to engineers, executives, and customers at any time
  * Able to define and manage complex process and/or product issues of a broad scope using independent judgment

### Bonus Points

  * You think itâ€™s fun to analyze data in SQL/R/Python/Matlab in your free time. You understand how to make big data small
  * Theoretical and practical knowledge of how the Internet works at layers 2 through 7.
  * Experience developing new enterprise SaaS products.
  * Previous Product Management experience

### Compensation

Compensation may be adjusted depending on work location.

  * For Colorado-based hires: Estimated annual salary of $140,000 - $172,000
  * For New York City, Washington, and California (excluding Bay Area) based hires: Estimated annual salary of $158,000 - $193,000

### What Makes Cloudflare Special?

Weâ€™re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. Weâ€™re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflareâ€™s enterprise customers--at no cost.

**Athenian Project** : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Hereâ€™s the deal - we donâ€™t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.
