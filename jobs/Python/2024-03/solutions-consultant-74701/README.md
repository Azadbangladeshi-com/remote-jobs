### Kontakt.io is a fast-growing company. It is extremely important for us to work with people who value the same virtues and fit our culture. Our Virtues and Culture:

  * Customer Leadership - customer leadership is the key. If a customer has a problem we donâ€™t wait. We understand what customers need and we tailor our services, products around the customer. It doesnâ€™t mean that we let the customer lead us. It means that we think about the customer first
  * Growth mindset - we commit to results and growth. We are responsible for results, not for the activity or time spent. If we believe we canâ€™t achieve a result or a job, itâ€™s our duty to raise the voice, push back, explain what we suggest instead. We donâ€™t see results as something static - ever. This means that our results and expectations are becoming more ambitious, quarter over quarter. We constantly evolve
  * Challenge, inspiration and respect - we are the challenger in the marketplace. When working with each other - or with customers - we enjoy and desire to challenge each other. We listen, reflect, and respond. We aim to understand the point of view of the other party and if there is customer merit in the argument. When we challenge, we articulate our hypothesis clearly and provide data and evidence in our argumentation. We respect the time of our colleagues. We have a zero-tolerance towards discrimination of any kind. We respect the environment
  * Systematic execution - We recognize that the start-up journey will only be successful if we learn twice as much as others in half the time. For us, innovation also means continuous improvement in all fields. We think in systems when driving results, growth, and learnings
  * Acting with urgency - We have a sense of urgency in everything we do - at all times. Itâ€™s deeply rooted in the belief that as an up-start, as a challenger, we need to drive value for our customers faster and better than anybody else in the marketplace. We do things outside of the personal comfort zone
