Description

### THE CHALLENGE

At Eventbrite, weâ€™re building the trusted marketplace for live experiences. Our creators expect to be able to post an event in minutes, and our consumers expect to buy a ticket immediately. Risk teams ensure that each and every step goes smoothly: creators know they will be paid on time and consumers trust the experience will be high quality. And weâ€™re always getting better by launching innovative features that delight customers but may introduce new risks to our business. At our scale, automation through machine learning is a necessity and our data scientists make it happen.

### THE TEAM

The Data Science team partners directly with product development teams to deliver machine learning solutions directly into critical product experiences through offline and real time solutions. Our team members work hand in hand with product development teams such as Personalization, Search and Discovery, and Fraud & Risk Prevention to solve customer problems like finding their next great live experience.

### THE ROLE

You will use machine learning to solve problems across a wide variety of features across the Eventbrite platform from transaction monitoring to account security to abusive language detection. You will leverage your familiarity with classic approaches like linear and tree-based models or learn new ones like large language models to develop practical, durable solutions to trust issues. You will implement those solutions for use in both real time and offline applications with the help of a dedicated risk platform engineering team. You will design monitoring and feedback loops that operationalize our solutions and confirm that they remain reliable as the platform develops and our adversaries change tactics. You will learn from senior members of the team how to identify opportunities to improve our technical capabilities and operational excellence.

  * Fluency with machine learning techniques and concepts including ownership of production models

  * Excellent communicator and collaborator willing to move quickly between problem areas
