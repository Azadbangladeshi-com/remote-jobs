### We Speak Simplicity:

Bestpass is a comprehensive payment platform provider and leader in toll management solutions for commercial fleets of all shapes and sizes.

Founded in 2001 by truckers for truckers, we are a trusted partner on the road and in the back office for customers and tolling authorities. When it comes to managing toll, it‚Äôs an easy task for a household consumer with only two cars in their driveway, but it is an incredibly complex task for trucking fleets.

**That's where Bestpass comes in. We make tolling simple!**

Our solutions help trucking fleets spend 40% less time managing transponders and 30% less time making toll payments, all while enjoying volume discounts (where applicable). Bestpass customers can turn their attention away from complex administrative tasks to focus on the challenges that are most important to their business. Seriously, who wouldn‚Äôt want to join our fleet?
