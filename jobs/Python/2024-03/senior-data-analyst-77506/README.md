As a (Senior) Data Analyst in our Business Intelligence team, you'll play a key role in helping various departments make informed choices based on solid data. Using your skills in SQL, ETL and visualisation tools, you'll turn complex data into understandable and actionable information. Your ability to clearly present these findings will provide crucial insights for the ongoing development and refinement of our products.

If you‚Äôre seeking a high-energy, feedback-rich culture with a dash of playfulness, you‚Äôre in the right place. Join us now and revolutionise the way airlines manage cargo!

üåç **You can work from (almost) anywhere in Europe and South Africa.** We are a remote company, but regularly meet in person, too. As a German company originally, we can support with visa processes only in Germany.

### üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What you‚Äôll be doing:

  * Serve as the essential link between our data output and the business users who rely on it. Understand their objectives and identify innovative methods to help achieve them effectively. 

  * Leverage your SQL mastery to build efficient queries that distil the raw data into ready-to-consume nuggets of valuable insight.

  * Surface your work to the business in a reusable and easy to access way using Looker‚Äôs LookML modelling layer, creating views and explores that enhance and enrich the data. Build optimised and user-friendly Looker dashboards / looks that provide great answers to the questions asked.

  * Deep-dive into strategically complex questions about our business and surface compelling narratives that can help transform the way we think about our products and users.

  * Maintain and expand our transformation layer with a focus on excellent data quality and integrity. Identify inefficiencies and inconsistencies within and proactively find better ways to do things.

  * Empower users across the organisation by helping them to better understand our data structure and how to extract the most value out of it.

### üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What you‚Äôll need:

  * 3+ years of relevant and practical experience as Data Analyst in a startup at the similar stage. 

  * Drive and curiosity, not just about working with data, but the business questions driving our work.

  * An excellent command of SQL, with its BigQuery flavour being ideal.

  * A strong focus on precision and quality. You're committed to delivering things that are both accurate and offer clear insights.

  * An outstanding ability and passion to communicate and visually present data and analyses using the best tools for the job.

  * A good understanding of ETL principles and experience in applying them effectively.

  * Designing efficient explores and views in Looker‚Äôs LookML would be a great plus.

  * Experience in building efficient transformations with dbt is a significant advantage.

  * Python for analytics experience (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) would also be great to have.

‚ù§Ô∏è **We think you will love working here if:**

  * You value building great relationships and trust with your team and managers.

  * You see working remotely successfully as a pioneering challenge which is constantly evolving.

  * You thrive in a fast-paced work environment.

  * You get a kick out of automating manual processes and helping cargonauts save time.

  * In everything you do, you take ownership and get a kick out of exceeding expectations.

  * When faced with the choice, you‚Äôd rather opt for the ambitious to ensure you grow, than take the easy option.

  * You see the value of giving and receiving feedback and incorporate this into everything you do. 

  * You are not afraid to voice your opinions and like using data to back them up.
