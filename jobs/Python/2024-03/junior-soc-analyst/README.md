# [Junior SOC Analyst](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/junior-soc-analyst)  
### BAE Systems  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

Location(s): UK, Europe & Africa : UK : Leeds

BAE Systems Digital Intelligence is home to 4,500 digital, cyber and intelligence experts. We work collaboratively across 10 countries to collect, connect and understand complex data, so that governments, nation states, armed forces and commercial businesses can unlock digital advantage in the most demanding environments.

BAE Systems have been contracted to undertake the day to day operation of (and incremental improvement of) a dedicated Security Operations Centre (SOC) to support the defence of a major UK CNI organisation. The networks protected are predominantly hosted in Azure and AWS cloud platforms, with many hundred systems within these environments that must be protected. The customer is committed to development of this improved SOC to be a benchmark of best practice and excellence in reflection of the significant threat that the protected systems are subject to.

The SOC will be staffed by a blend of customer and BAE Systems staff, based in multiple locations, but with the day to day operations based from our Leeds office (due to the need for customer network access available at this location).

The SOC Analyst roles are â€˜hands-onâ€™ shift based roles, working as part of a 24/7 operation with four shift teams working in a standard rotation. They are responsible for utilising the SOCâ€™s SIEM and SOAR toolsets to detect and investigate potential Security and Service Incidents occurring within the monitored networks.

These roles require a minimum of SC clearance and be prepared to undergo DV clearance. Due to timelines for the start of operations, it will not be possible to sponsor new clearances so candidates must have existing clearances.

Initial requirements are for a blend of 6 month and 12 month roles, which may be extended in future subject to other programme variables that will be clarified during delivery. Position is expected to work from company offices on a full time basis.

### Responsibilities

  * Monitor, triage, analyse and investigate alerts, log data and network traffic using the Protective Monitoring platform and Internet resources to identify cyber-attacks / security incidents.

  * Write up high quality security incident tickets using a combination of existing knowledge resources and independent research.
  * Assist with remediation activities (or support customer stakeholders) to inhibit cyber-attacks, clean up IT systems and secure networks against repeat attacks.
  * Produce security incident review reports to present information about the security incident and provide security improvement recommendations based on the security incident review.
