### Who we are

At dbt Labs, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics.

### Specifically, we believe that:

  * Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic
  * Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers
  * Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software
  * Analytic code itself â€” not just analytics tools â€” will increasingly be open source
