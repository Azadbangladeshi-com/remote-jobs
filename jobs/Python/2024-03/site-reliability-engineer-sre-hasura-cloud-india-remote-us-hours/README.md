Description

Hasura Cloud is a unique GraphQL product that lessens the effort that goes into building backends for applications. Our customers can use Hasura Cloud to generate a fully-featured unified GraphQL API connected to several databases and other REST/GraphQL APIs.

  

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) are responsible for keeping Hasura Cloud systems running smoothly and making sure updates can be rolled out reliably without any downtime.

### What the role will involve:

  * Build out our infrastructure with Terraform, Kubernetes, VMs and bare metal instances.
  * Design, build and maintain core infrastructure pieces that allow Hasura Cloud scaling to support thousands of concurrent requests from our users.
  * Expand Hasura Cloud to support multiple Cloud providers.
  * Improve the deployment process to make it as reliable and boring as possible.
  * Be on a PagerDuty rotation to respond to Hasura Cloud availability incidents and provide support for service engineers with customer incidents.
  * Use your dev time to address the systemic issues youâ€™ve identified, to proactively prevent incidents from happening.
  * Design smart monitoring that alerts on symptoms (our SLIs) rather than on causes, to make each alert meaningful and actionable.
  * Document every action so your findings turn into repeatable actionsâ€“and then into automation.
  * Debug production issues across services and levels of the stack.
  * Plan the growth of Hasura Cloud's infrastructure.

### Requirements:

  * 4+ years of experience
  * Think about systems - edge cases, failure modes, behaviors, specific implementations.
  * Know your way around Linux and the Unix Shell.
  * Know how to use declarative infrastructure tools like Terraform.
  * Have strong programming skills (Go/Python).
  * Value asynchronous collaboration and communication with your globally distributed team.
  * Enjoy documenting all the things so you don't need to learn the same thing twice.
  * Have an urge to build automation and tooling so that you never have to do the same work twice.
  * Have an enthusiastic, go-for-it attitude. When you see something broken, you can't help but fix it.
  * Have experience with Nginx, Openresty, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, or similar technologies.
  * Have experience with various Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, DO etc., their systems, products and APIs.
  * Have experience with monitoring tools like Honeycomb/Datadog/Prometheus/Grafana.

#### Nice to have:

  * Have experience with Hasura and its GraphQL APIs.
  * Have strong fundamentals in SQL, particularly with PostgreSQL.
  * Have experience with database management and scaling.
