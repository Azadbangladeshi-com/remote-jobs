Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.

Affirm is looking for an enthusiastic Infrastructure or Site Reliability Engineer to join our growing Reliability Engineering (SRE) organization. Your team will set the bar for reliability, availability, and resilience across our entire infrastructure. Ensuring reliability and scalability for such an infrastructure is hard. Our consistency and security requirements make scaling harder. The Reliability Engineering team ensures that Affirm's systems meet our users' and partners' performance requirements, enabling the rest of engineering to control their own reliability outcomes through immediate, actionable visibility into the applications that they build and deploy.

### What Youâ€™ll Do

  * Relentlessly analyze and improve the performance, latency, and reliability of our service.
  * Develop tooling, automation, and standards which will allow your peers to self-service their own reliability outcomes. Guide the engineering organization towards implementing their own reliability best practices, including observability, change management, and incident response.
  * Participate in our global incident management lifecycle process, with a particular focus on how to measure and represent the program impact.
  * Work with development teams to ensure their code meets production performance criteria.
  * Expand the scope of our reliability engineering practice to include advanced capabilities, including chaos and performance engineering.

### What We Look For

  * Experience building and owning large-scale, geographically distributed backend systems. Exposure to front-end is extra credit.
  * Highly skilled at developing and debugging in one or more programming languages. You should think of yourself as an engineer and help implement proven software development practices within your team. Python? Great! Go or Kotlin? Even greater!
  * You should have deep experience with modern infrastructure and observability trends, especially in a production Kubernetes environment. Your team and your peers want to learn from you.
  * Experience with operating system internals, filesystems, databases, and networks.
  * You obsess about performance and metrics.
  * Experience with AWS or other cloud providers, especially if youâ€™ve run Kubernetes on them.
