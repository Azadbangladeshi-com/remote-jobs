# [Machine Learning Engineer (Fraud)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/machine-learning-engineer-fraud)  
### NALA  
#### `üåé United Kingdom`  

### üíô Our Mission

We have recently updated our Company Mission to reflect our ambitions to build the future of payments in Africa. You can read all about it here.

###  **Why does our mission matter?**

There are over 1.3 billion Africans in the world and is the fastest growing region in the world. Africa is also the most expensive place to send money to and trade with. Talent is everywhere but opportunity isn‚Äôt. How do we bridge this divide with a sense of purpose?

  * Think about people living far away from their loved ones who are financially responsible and support them. Imagine how you would feel losing 8-9% of your money through fees. **How do we reduce the cost of sending money home through technology?**
  *  **What about the future for businesses?** Think about those who are trying to do cross-border business from Africa outbound to the rest of the world? Why is it so hard to trade today? Why do people have to send money with other people physically or cash on planes? How much money and time is lost while doing this?
  *  **What about the reliability of trade?** When payments are delayed, that means business is disrupted. This costs everyone money. It loses us trust of customers.
  *  **What about the future of work?** Think about those young TikTok influencers in Uganda who make amazing content, but can‚Äôt get paid because they don‚Äôt have Visa or Mastercards yet have mobile money?

 **NALA‚Äôs true impact will be measured by the opportunities we create for Africa to trade with the world and the world to trade with Africa.**
