Description

**Introduction to Demandbase:** ****

Demandbase is the Smarter GTMâ„¢ company for B2B brands. We help marketing and sales teams overcome the disruptive data and technology fragmentation that inhibits insight and forces them to spam their prospects. We do this by injecting Account Intelligence into every step of the buyer journey, wherever our clients interact with customers, and by helping them orchestrate every action across systems and channels - through advertising, account-based experience, and sales motions. The result? You spot opportunities earlier, engage with them more intelligently, and close deals faster.

As a company, weâ€™re as committed to growing careers as we are to building world-class technology. We invest heavily in people, our culture, and the community around us. We have offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and teams in the UK and India, and allow employees to work remotely. **We have also been** **continuously recognized as one of the best places to work in the San Francisco Bay Area.**

We're committed to attracting, developing, retaining, and promoting a diverse workforce. By ensuring that every Demandbase employee is able to bring a diversity of talents to work, we're increasingly capable of living out our mission to transform how B2B goes to market. We encourage people from historically underrepresented backgrounds and all walks of life to apply. **Come grow with us at Demandbase!**

**About the Role:**

You will be a member of Demandbaseâ€™s Central Data Science team that drives product innovation and is responsible for all ML/AI initiatives and projects. We build and apply ML models at every stage of the B2B buyerâ€™s journey. Starting from the top of the funnel, Data Scientists build account rank models to score tens of millions of companies and also recommend companies that arenâ€™t yet in their CRM. Our Data Scientists apply cutting-edge natural language processing algorithms and deep learning models to predict whether a company is interested in our clients' products even before they visit their site. Once ML-generated account lists are built, we launch campaigns to generate awareness and traffic to target sites.

Our Data Scientists build pacing, pricing, click-through rate, and engagement models using tens of billions of auctions daily to optimize campaign performance. We build reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize the user experience when potential prospects click on ads/banners and visit our customersâ€™ websites.

Our Data Scientists build real-time intent using time series analysis to trigger an alert for sales after potential prospects share their contact information, to contact prospects when thereâ€™s an intent surge. ML models are a significant differentiator for each of our offerings in the ABM platform, Targeting, Conversion, and Intent products. Our Data Scientists not only build ML models, but are also substantially involved in productizing the models, and working closely and cross-functionally with data engineering, application, product, and UX design teams to deliver the worldâ€™s best account-based marketing and advertising product.
