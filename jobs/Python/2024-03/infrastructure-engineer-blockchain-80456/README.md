# [Infrastructure Engineer (Blockchain)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/infrastructure-engineer-blockchain-80456)  
### Logos  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Worldwide`  

Logos is a movement supporting the development of the decentralised web. Logos technologies lay the foundations for a freer internet upon which communities can evolve into network states. Each protocol in the Logos stack seeks to empower its users while upholding civil liberties and fundamental freedoms.

**The role**

DevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.

Supporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.

But fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.

If you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.

  * Distros and package managers
  * Good understanding of process management
