###  **Location:**

While we are open to remote work across the contingent US, we are still in the process of establishing our company to support work in all states! We‚Äôve recently made the shift from an in-office organization to a hybrid model and love the flexibility it allows our employees. We are set up to support employees who want to be fully remote, in-office only, and a mix of the two. Please note - we will not be supporting work based out of the following states: CA, MA, NY, NJ.

  * Deliver optimization insights for ongoing initiatives through ad hoc analysis and performance dashboards.
  * Monitor key product metrics, KPIs, and customer behavior to identify areas for improvement.
  * Effectively communicate findings to both technical and non-technical teams, translating complex data into understandable and actionable stories.

### **What We're Looking For:**

As we evaluate candidates across all roles, we look for folks who have a strong sense of ownership, great communication and collaboration skills, and a dedication to continuous improvement.

  * 5+ years of professional (or comparable) analyst experience
  * Experience with SQL and relational databases, with Python knowledge being a plus
  * Experience with BI platforms (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Hex)
  * Strong analytical skills and a passion for problem-solving, with a history of delivering data-driven solutions
  * Familiarity with product analytics methodologies and experimentation statistics
  * Knowledge of the insurance industry, including familiarity with insurance products and related data analysis is a plus

### **Benefits & Perks:**

Inclusive and healthy environments are crafted intentionally. All of our employees can join and participate in (or create your own!) Employee Resource Groups. Here are some other wonderful perks of working here:

  * Competitive Compensation & Stock Option Offering
  * Health, Dental, Vision & Disability Coverages
  * HSA offering + employer contribution
  * 401k plan + employer match
  * Unlimited PTO (paid time off)+ the flexibility to enjoy it
