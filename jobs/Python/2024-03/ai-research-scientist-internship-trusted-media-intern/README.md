# **Job Details:**

## Job Description:

Responsibilities may be quite diverse of a technical nature. U.S. experience and education requirements will vary significantly depending on the unique needs of the job. Job assignments are usually for the summer or for short periods during breaks from school.  
  
Geometric, Generative, and Good AI Team in Intelligent Systems Research Lab, Intel Labs conducts inter-disciplinary research for unraveling AI for humans to amplify human potential in physical and digital worlds, by creating trustworthy AI systems; AI-ficiation of complex problems; and reconstructing, animating, and securing digital personas. Research topics root from computational geometry, computer vision, and signal processing methods in 2D and 3D, to formulate problems in the specific domain and to build AI-based novel perspectives using the priors of that domain. We conduct fundamental and applied research in the context of vertical domains including manufacturing, media, enterprise, metaverse, and assistive computing.  
  
Intel Labs is an industry-leading research organization, responsible for driving Intel's technology pipeline, product innovations, and creating new opportunities. The mission of Intel Labs is to deliver breakthrough technologies to fuel Intel's growth. This includes identifying and exploring compelling new technologies and high-risk opportunities ahead of business unit investment and demonstrating first-to-market technologies and innovative new usages for computing technology. Intel Labs engages the leading thinkers in academia and industry in addition to partnering closely with Intel business units.  
  
G3 AI Team is looking for a motivated summer intern with experience at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision domains who can collaborate on research projects being conducted in one or more of G3 AI's focus areas. The successful candidate will be working on developing responsible AI approaches related to the integrity of digital content, including manipulated content detection, synthetic data generation, media provenance, and adversarial attacks on such systems, with one or more of modalities such as vision, audio, speech, or biological signals. Current projects span across vertical domains like manipulated media identification using biological priors, novel neural network architectures for responsible generation, or integrating media provenance to AI algorithms. In this position you will have the opportunity to conduct independent research on building multimodal learning systems and applications. Typical work would span across exploring signals and priors of
different domains, data curation and database ingestion, developing, optimizing, and deploying deep learning models within different domains, and developing and applying model interpretation methods to support decision making. You will be researching fundamental concepts and methods for exploiting authenticity and fakery signals in manipulated media, building and evaluating systems and proofs-of-concept that will allow for the deployment of scalable approaches in real settings. This research will enable internal technology transfers and publication of findings in both internal and external venues. In addition to the research collaterals, building proof of concept prototypes is also expected from the candidate.

**Behavior traits:**

  * Proven track record of collaboration and technical leadership to deliver leading-edge solutions.
  * Verbal communication, technical writing, and presentation skills
  * Independent research, debugging, and prototyping capabilities.

 _This is an internship position and compensation will be given accordingly._
