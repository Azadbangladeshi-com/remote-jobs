We are looking for a Cloud Engineer who is interested in working with Public Clouds, private Clouds and bare metal to join our globally distributed infrastructure team.

We build Presto - an innovative product in the Blockchain industry which allows anyone to create their own blockchain based on zk-rollup technology in a few clicks in an automated way and smoothly run it as a service managed by delegating all the complexity of setting up, maintaining and upgrading tasks to us.

  * Build our internal tooling using Python and Django to automate our infrastructure tasks

## Our stack

  

  * Hashicorp Nomad/Consul and Docker swarm to orchestrate the micro-services and deployments
  * Terraform/Terragrunt to manage hundreds of servers on different cloud providers. We also work on implementing Pulumi to integrate these tasks into our internal Python tooling
  * Ansible for provisioning and configuring our servers
  * Grafana stack for monitoring

  * Participate in (additionally compensated) on-call procedures

## **Requirements and skills**

  
Our ideal candidate worked in start up like companies and can start contributing within a few days.  
  
It's great if you have blockchain experience already, but if you do not we are happy to teach you. Also, if your past experience does not 100% match our stack, but you have experience with equivalent technologies, we will be happy to talk to you.  
  
Specifically, we are looking for a candidate who:  

  * Has strong written and verbal communication skills (in English)
  * Knows how to setup monitoring solutions such as Grafana, Prometheus, Log processing

  * _Lean (Kanban) methodology:_ We focus on people and getting things done.
