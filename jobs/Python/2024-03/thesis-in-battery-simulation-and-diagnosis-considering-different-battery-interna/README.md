### Job Description

With the emerging technologies like autonomous driving and x-by-wire systems, the vehicle's onboard power supply system, also known as the powernet, is subject to stringent safety requirements. The failure of the powernet leads immediately to the loss of all the safety related functions like braking, steering, automous driving functions etc. Among all the powernet components, special attention shall be paid on the battery due to its complicated electrochemical nature. In this project we delve into the cutting edge of probabilistic safety argumentation for complex functions, with a special focus on model-based diagnostic functions within the onboard power supply system. This project aims to enhance the reliability and safety validation of complex algorithms, leveraging statistical methods and data-driven techniques to argue the safety of battery diagnosis functions that estimate the current state and predict future conditions of batteries.

  * During your thesis, you will generate synthetic data of batteries under different operating states by adjusting the parameters of the battery model.
  * You will implement a Kalman filter based diagnosis for online estimation of battery internal states and model parameters.
  * Furthermore, you will be responsible for virtual validation of the diagnosis using Monte Carlo simulation.
  * Additionally, you will gain insights into the cutting-edge research that contributes to the safety and reliability of automotive systems and have the opportunity to co-author research papers and contribute to academic discussions.
  * Finally, you will supplement literature reviews to identify and summarize state-of-the-art methodologies, case studies, and theoretical frameworks relevant to uncertainty quantification, and model validation.

### Qualifications

  *  **Education:** studies in the field of Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or comparable
  *  **Experience and Knowledge:** familiarity with one of the programming languages (Python, MATLAB) for simulation and modeling is beneficial, prior experience with foundation of battery and model based diagnosis like Kalman filter is an advantage
  *  **Personality and Working Practice:** motivated and ready to learn new stuff
  *  **Working Routine:** mobile working within Germany
  *  **Languages:** very good in English or German

### Additional Information

 **Start:** according to prior agreement  
 **Duration:** 6 months  
 **Working Routine:** mobile working within Germany

You want to work flexibly from your home in Germany or prefer working at the Bosch location in Stuttgart-Weilimdorf? For positions with the addition ‚Äúremote possible‚Äù, you can agree on the appropriate collaboration for your task together with your manager and your team within the framework of Smart Work.

Requirement for this thesis is the enrollment at university. Please attach your CV, transcript of records, examination regulations and if indicated a valid work and residence permit.
