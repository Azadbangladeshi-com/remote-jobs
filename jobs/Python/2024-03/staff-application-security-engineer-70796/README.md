# [Staff Application Security Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/staff-application-security-engineer-70796)  
### Assured Insurance Technologies  
#### `💰 ~195k` `🌎 Remote`  

Description

Assured is on a mission to modernize insurance. Claims processing (i.e. should we pay this claim?), while often overlooked, is the foundation of the entire industry. It’s currently highly manual, involving phone calls, faxes, and gut instinct—costing tens of billions of dollars a year. We can do better.

At Assured, we provide large insurers with the software solutions they need to win in a modern, technology-driven world. From self-service claim filing software to backend fraud detection, we’re the engine that powers claims processing for some of the largest insurers in the world.

The challenges we face are deep and diverse—from creating digital experiences that provide comfort and clarity to claimants at their most stressed and vulnerable to orchestrating large-scale ML-driven decision-making on billions of dollars of claims payments, life at Assured is dynamic, collaborative, and rewarding.

We are looking for a Staff Application Security Engineer to join our growing team.
