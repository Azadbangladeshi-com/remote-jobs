### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ‰Ω†Â•Ω, hallo, v√≠tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What you‚Äôd be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### You will:

  * Coach, mentor, and strengthen a team of 10 QA engineers to meet the needs of diverse teams while developing skills and increasing impact
  * Support current and emerging coaches in their roles
  * Work closely with the Supergroup leadership team to understand the product roadmap and align on test strategy
  * Build out timelines and plan test activities across multiple strategies to support company launch events.
  * Identify opportunities to improve quality in the group, and set goals and drive actions for the C&D QA team
  * Guide and inspire QA Engineers to increase their impact by setting growth goals around FE automation, risk-based testing, mobile, performance, security and API testing skills
  * Work closely with other QA leads to set and drive QA goals across the C&D supergroup and the QA Subspecialty
  * Perform structured performance reviews, conduct regular 1:1s, and participate in the hiring process of new QA engineers

### You're probably a match if

  * You have a history of success in technical people leadership and mentorship of QA engineers.
  * You have experience working with product teams and defining the QA process for your team. This may involve looking at the current development process for each team, identifying opportunities for injecting quality, and advocating for process changes to improve product quality
  * You have exceptional stakeholder management skills, you can drive a QA roadmap forward and proactively rally a team around it while driving alignment with stakeholders.
  * You have exceptional problem-solving skills, with the ability to break large projects down into smaller ones, define clear outcomes and measures of success, and deliver on them through others.
  * You have experience with defining QA metrics, setting ambitious targets and driving actions to reach them
  * You have experience testing complex web and mobile apps (iOS and Android). You are meticulous in your work and passionate about testing. You consider every possible scenario during exploratory testing and can spot bugs that others might not notice. 
  * You‚Äôre capable of leading by example - promoting Canva‚Äôs values, no-blame mentality, and engineering values

### Not a must, but a big plus if:

  * You have FE and Mobile test automation experience and/or have automated trivial tasks using a scripting language like Bash or Python. You have a good understanding of what needs to be included in unit, integration, and end-to-end tests and can coach engineers on what needs to be automated.

### About the team

About the Content & Discovery (C&D) SuperGroup: Canva is a content company as much as a design company. We enable our users to get professional looking designs without needing to be designers. To do this, users need to have awesome templates to get started and amazing ingredients to help them customise the design to their needs.

The Content & Discovery SuperGroup has one goal: to produce the freshest, most relevant, diverse, inclusive and localised content that our users will love using in their Canva creations.This SuperGroup is responsible for sourcing all the design content in Canva. This means the templates, images, stickers, video, audio, etc. We create them in house with our team of designers, or buy/licence them, or enable the public to upload their work via the Creator program and earn a royalty when it‚Äôs used.

Content & Discovery is also responsible for making all the content discoverable both inside and outside of the product. Inside the product, we are responsible for the Search and Recommendation systems. We are responsible for the infrastructure, search and recommendation quality as well as presenting the results in the various surfaces. The surfaces include the home page and the Marketplace Pages where users can browse for content. It also includes the Editor via the Object Panel where users can search for content and drag it into their design. Outside of the product, we are also responsible for surfacing the content in SEO so that when a user searches for something like ‚ÄúInstagram Templates‚Äù Canva shows up on the first page if not the first result.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
