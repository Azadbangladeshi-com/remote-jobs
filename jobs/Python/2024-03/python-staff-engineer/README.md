### What youâ€™ll do

As a Python Staff Engineer, you excel in driving coding excellence and you possess deep understanding of design patterns, code quality, and testing frameworks.

Note that as Senior level professional, you have a history of technical leadership and are able to explain complex technical concepts to others. This is critical as you will be responsible for reviewing colleagues' coding and ensure highest standard of quality. You live by good coding principles and can coach others to follow them.
