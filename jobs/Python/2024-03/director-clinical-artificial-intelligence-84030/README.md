### POSITION SUMMARY:

Natera, a leader in personalized genetic testing and diagnostics, is seeking a **Director of Clinical Artificial Intelligence** (ClinAI) to lead our program developing and deploying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to advance the field of clinical diagnostics. This key role is centered on guiding research and development efforts aimed at improving cancer detection, treatment planning, and monitoring through cutting-edge AI solutions. The successful candidate will possess a robust blend of technical expertise in AI/ML and an understanding of its clinical applications in oncology, reproductive medicine, and organ health.

### PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:

  * **Leadership and Strategic Direction** :
    * Provide strategic leadership for the Clinical AI team, crafting and executing a vision for AI-driven innovations in diagnostics and therapeutics. Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including translational sciences, R&D, medical affairs, program management, and software development, to design and deploy AI models that enhance diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic accuracy & efficiency.
  *  **Clinical Large-Language Models (LLMs)** :
    * Spearhead the optimization and/or creation of biological models to generate insights into disease mechanisms, predict outcomes, and enhance therapeutic design. Additionally, oversee the use of LLMs to efficiently extract critical information from electronic health records, clinical trial data, and scientific publications, enhancing the foundation for diagnostic and treatment decisions.
  *  **Genomic & Multi-Omics Data Analysis**:
    * Direct projects that apply ML algorithms for the examination of tumor genetic data, aiming to identify critical mutations and biomarkers that inform personalized treatment approaches.
