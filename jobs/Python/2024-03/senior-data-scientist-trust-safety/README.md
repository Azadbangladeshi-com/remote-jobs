_In the United States, we have a flexible hybrid work policy for employees who live within 30 miles of our office headquartered in New York City. Employees within the New York Metropolitan area are expected to work from the NYC office twice a week, unless there is a job-specific requirement to be in the office every workday. Employees outside of this area are considered part of our remote-first workforce. We believe our hybrid approach for those near our NYC office increases productivity through more in-person collaboration where possible._
