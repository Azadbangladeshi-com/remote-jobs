Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.

The Credit team works cross-functionally with Machine Learning, Product, Engineering, Capital Markets, and Commercial teams to responsibly manage the risk profile of the business. Weâ€™re looking for a thoughtful, driven individual who wants to learn, grow, and solve hard problems.

The teamâ€™s mandate is to enable sustainable growth while closely managing the profitability and resilience of our portfolio. As Affirm continues on an exciting growth trajectory, thinking through credit strategies for new initiatives and products, shaping ongoing testing and experimentation, and being ready for navigating through any exogenous changes will be important problems to tackle.

This role requires extensive use of data analytics to derive insights and develop credit strategies. It also requires a lot of cross-functional partnership. Working with the Machine Learning and Engineering team to develop new underwriting models, with the Product teams to develop new products and features, with the Merchant Pricing team to value different merchants, with the Finance team to help facilitate discussions with debt and equity investors are some parts of the role.

Come join us in our mission to change consumer finance through better data and technology, lower costs, and increased transparency while providing the best customer experience!

  * Partner with Machine Learning and Engineering teams on building effective credit risk capabilities
