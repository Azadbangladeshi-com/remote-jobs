### Lithic  
#### `ðŸ’° 420000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Our mission is to make payments safer and easier for everyone. We started with a consumer product (privacy.com) that helps people spend more safely using virtual payment cards. Then we launched a simple, modern API to make our payment and card issuing infrastructure available to other startups, fintechs, and brands. Today, that infrastructure is known as Lithic, and it powers billions of dollars in payments for some of the most innovative companies in the world.

Lithic is a **remote-first** company and has a distributed team with an office in New York. That means that if you want to work remotely, you can! If you want to drop by the office or work fully in-person, you can do that, too! Weâ€™ve raised $100M+ from top-tier investors including Index, Bessemer, Stripes, and Tusk Venture Partners, with a recent Series C that will help us scale.

We are hiring a **Staff Software Engineer** for our Card Program team to lead Lithicâ€™s next phase of growth - youâ€™ll be doing as much technical leadership as you will be writing code. The Card Program team maintains services that manage the entire lifecycle of a card, including card issuance, physical card manufacturing, digital wallet tokenization, as well as KYB/KYC. Additionally, the Card Program designs and maintains the stability of Lithicâ€™s API (gateway, SDK), working with other Lithic teams to maintain our developer-first brand promise. You will become an expert in the card payments space. The team primarily uses Python and C++.

  * Ensure high reliability and availability for Lithicâ€™s API
  * Lead development of new card lifecycle features (card issuance, tokenization, and physical card manufacturing)
  * Ensure that the team is delivering reliable, secure, and scalable code with minimal tech debt
  * Own initiatives from planning to launch, keeping stakeholders informed and aligned along the way
  * Lead efforts to improve systems and processes both within the team and across engineering 
  * Drive strategic planning in collaboration with the engineering manager and product manager
  * Mentor, sponsor, and empower team members to help them grow
  * Participate in the team on-call rotation
