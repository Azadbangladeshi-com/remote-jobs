### About Ukio |

We are one of the most promising startups of 2023 with headquarters in Spain. We were founded in Barcelona, and since then, we've expanded to include offices in Madrid, Lisbon, Berlin, and Paris. This is only the beginning as we've got our sights set on spreading to the rest of Europe and later to include other continents as well ðŸš€.

Ukio's mission is to empower individuals to live where they want, when they want ðŸŒŽ. We do this by disrupting the traditional residential real estate market, providing fully furnished and artfully designed apartments for stays starting at one month. We remove all the hassle around finding a rental with no long-term contracts, security deposits, broker fees, moving/buying furniture, etc., giving choice and flexibility to allow people to plant their roots anywhere ðŸ’¥.

Backed by Europe's best Venture Capital firms, this year will be vital in our growth as we look to further build out our team, further establish ourselves in our current markets, and expand our reach into multiple new markets ðŸ”¥. We are currently ranked in the top 10 startups in Spain by Linkedin, and we have successfully raised a Series A investment round of â‚¬27 million that will help propel our growth throughout Western Europe and bring us closer to reaching our goalsðŸ¥‡.

### Our culture |

We honor diversity, compassion, and honesty above all else in our team. Weâ€™ve already got a great mix of dedicated, collaborative, and results-driven people and are looking for more like minded folks to join our team. In true startup fashion, we always embrace the unknown and grant full autonomy to our team members to act as the owners of their projects and tasks. We are creators who embrace dynamic environments and take on and build up projects from scratch.
