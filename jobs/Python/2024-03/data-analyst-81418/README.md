Description

Data without context is just a set of disconnected facts, meaningless points. To be useful, data needs to be converted into actionable knowledge. It needs to be intertwined into a bigger picture, associated with a hypothesis that needs to be solved. To do this we need an investigative sense, analytical experience and, above all, a curious mind.

  

CloudWalk wants to change how money is defined and used, and for that we need people that can navigate through uncharted waters of chaotic data. People that want to fight against this isomorphic world are all immersed into searching for new meanings, new possibilities. People that have critical thinking to go deeper into understanding the reasons behind why things happen.

  

Our R&D team is responsible for research and development of analysis, models and anything data related for usage in all areas of the company, like Marketing, Risk, Customer Support and others. We are looking for someone to analyze and transform data from different origins, to generate reports, create tools and find insights. Someone that will act as a bridge between the company Data Scientists and the business area.

  * Customer Lifecycle: Generate insights from analysis regarding customer behavior, analyze customer acquisition and churn, work on improving marketing campaigns and delivering dashboards for stakeholders.
  * Geospatial Data: Develop map visualizations, perform geospatial analysis and generate features for predictive models. Experience with maps and related packages like GIS, GeoPandas and Folium (or R equivalent packages) and knowledge of basic JavaScript and HTML is recommended.
  * Customer Support: Analyze data from interactions of humans with LLM-based bots, to assess quality and insights. Experience with NLP related tasks and knowledge of LLMs is recommended.

### What You‚Äôll Be Doing:

  * Create and maintain data visualization and dashboard tools
  * Gather data for evaluation of proposed methods by the team
  * Interpret data, and analyze results using statistical techniques
  * Filter and ‚Äúclean‚Äù data from different sources

  * Communication skills. You should be able to communicate effectively with multiple teams.

  * Knowledge of BI tools such as Metabase or Tableau
  * Experience with Cloud platforms like GCP
  * Knowledge of geospatial concepts and principles, including coordinate systems, spatial data formats and related packages like GeoPandas, Folium, Mapbox and GIS (for the geospatial oriented position). If you know more R related packages like sf or Leaftet, that is also fine!
  * Experience with geospatial and geographic data sources like OpenStreetMap, IBGE data (Census and other surveys) is a plus!
