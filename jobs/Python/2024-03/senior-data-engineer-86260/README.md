##  **About TestGorilla**

At TestGorilla, we envision a world where everyone has their dream job. To achieve that, employers and employees need to have the right information about each other.

We started in 2020 by building a screening platform that enables employers to evaluate candidates in the skills that matter most for success in a role. Our product replaces subjective, incomplete, and often inflated CVs with objective, reliable, and fair test results measuring aptitude, practical job skills, culture add, and motivation.

Improving and expanding this platform is our core focus at the moment, but it‚Äôs only the beginning of our journey to get everyone their dream job. Over time, we will launch more products that support this mission.

Last year, we secured $70m in Series A funding, co-led by the venture capital firms Atomico and Balderton Capital. The funding brings the company‚Äôs total investment to $80m following previous investments from Notion, Partech, and CapitalT. Chances are you‚Äôre familiar with some of our biggest customers, like the UK‚Äôs National Health Service, 3M, Sony, Oracle, PepsiCo, Bain & Company, and Deloitte.

We work remotely, spread across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa.

## **Interested?**

We don‚Äôt offer rainbow glitter unicorns or dog-friendly offices (we literally don‚Äôt have an office), but we do offer real people, solid core values, and a product meant to give everyone a fair, unbiased chance at their dream jobs.

Here at TestGorilla, we eat our own dog food. We use our assessment platform to make sure we make the best hiring decisions faster and bias-free.

So if this role sounds like a good fit for you, I‚Äôd like you to take an assessment so we can get a better idea about whether you would fit the role. It‚Äôs also a great opportunity for you to get to know our product!

We encourage diverse applicants from a myriad of educational, work, and personal backgrounds to apply. We are a parent-friendly/caregiver-friendly employer who recognizes the importance of having a great life outside of work.

If you‚Äôre hired, I‚Äôll do everything I can to help you succeed at TestGorilla and throughout the rest of your career.
