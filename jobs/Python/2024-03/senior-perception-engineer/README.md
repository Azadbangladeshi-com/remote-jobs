Description

Intelligent machines powered by Artificial Intelligence computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. GPU Deep Learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason and solve problems. Now, NVIDIAâ€™s GPU runs Deep Learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

We are now looking for an extraordinary Senior Perception Engineer to develop and productize NVIDIA's autonomous driving solutions. As a member of our perception team, you will work on building world class 3D obstacle perception solutions by fusing multiple input modalities, such as ultrasonics, cameras, and radars. The primary approach will be deep learning. You will be challenged to improve robustness and accuracy as well as efficiency of the solutions to fully enable autonomous driving anywhere and anytime.

 **What you'll be doing:**

  * Perception expert with application focus will be on near-field perception/fusion in unstructured environments, including parking functionalities and low-speed driving.

  * Applied research and develop innovative deep learning and sensor fusion algorithms to improve output accuracy of 3D obstacle perception solutions under challenging and diverse scenarios.

  * Identify and analyze the strength and weakness of the developed 3D obstacle perception solutions using large scale benchmark data (both real and synthetic) and improve them iteratively through KPI building and optimization.

  * Productize the developed 3D obstacle perception solutions by meeting product requirements for safety, latency, and SW robustness.

  * Drive and prioritize data-driven development by working with large data collection and labeling teams to bring in high value data to improve perception system accuracy. Efforts will include data collection prioritization and planning, labeling prioritization, so that value of data is maximized.

 **What we need to see:**

  * 5+ years of hands-on work experience in developing deep learning and algorithms to solve sophisticated real world problems, and proficiency in using deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch).

  * Experience in data-driven development and collaboration with data and ground truth teams.

  * Strong programming skills in python and/or C++.

  * Outstanding communication and teamwork skills as we work as a tightly-knit team, always discussing and learning from each other.

  * BS/MS/PhD in CS, EE, sciences or related fields (or equivalent experience)

 **Ways to stand out from the crowd:**

  * Proven expertise in developing perception solutions for autonomous driving or robotics using deep learning and experience on diverse sensor modalities such as cameras, ultrasonics, and radar.

  * Hands-on experience in developing and deploying DNN-based solutions to embedded platforms for real time applications.

  * Proven expertise in deep learning backed up by technical publications in leading conferences/journals.

  * Good understanding of fundamentals of 3D computer vision, camera calibrations including intrinsic and extrinsic.

  * Experience with development in CUDA language. The ability to implement CUDA kernels as part of training or inference pipelines.

The base salary range is 148,000 USD - 276,000 USD. Your base salary will be determined based on your location, experience, and the pay of employees in similar positions.

You will also be eligible for equity and benefits. _NVIDIA accepts applications on an ongoing basis. _

NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law.
