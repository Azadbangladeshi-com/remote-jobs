### Stellar Health

### About Stellar Health:

Historically, US Healthcare has relied on a fee-for-service reimbursement system where providers are paid based on the quantity of patient visits and procedures, rather than the quality of health outcomes.

At Stellar Health, we help primary care providers put patient health first. Our platform - a mix of technology, people, and analytics - supports providers at the point of care, delivering real-time patient information, activating practice staff, and empowering providers and care teams with incentives that reward the work they are already doing to keep patients healthy. Using the Stellar App, our web-based, point-of-care tool; practices receive a simple checklist of recommended actions that support the best quality care. Providers and care teams are then paid monthly for each action they complete, and Payors save money in reduced healthcare costs along the way.

Stellar is a US-based Health-tech backed by Top VCs ( _General Atlantic, Point72, & Primary Venture Partners)_‚Äã‚Äã with an established product & proven operating model. We‚Äôve shown that we make a real difference for physician practices and their patients.

 **About the position:  
  
** DevOps engineering can take on several meanings, so one question we‚Äôd ask is: ‚ÄúHow do they actually define DevOps/DevSecOps responsibilities within their Engineering organization?‚Äù  
  
For Stellar Health, our goal within the DevSecOps team is to create and manage capabilities that our Product and Engineering teams can leverage themselves. We pair those capabilities with guardrails, for both security and maintainability to help keep everyone accountable. These guardrails can be terraform modules, security scans, or just a code review.  
  
While a continuously evolving target, we want to support our fellow Engineering teams to be able to deploy what they need, in a secure, consistent and maintainable way and make it as easy as it should be to do so.

Here is some information around the scope of services and technology we leverage to do help move us towards that goal:

  * You are motivated by identifying and prioritizing problems as much as solving them
  * You are analytical and thoughtful. You experiment and test potential approaches just enough before committing to the technical solution

 **Pay:  
**  
The salary range for this role is **$200,000 - $240,000 and will be eligible for an annual performance based bonus and equity grant.**
