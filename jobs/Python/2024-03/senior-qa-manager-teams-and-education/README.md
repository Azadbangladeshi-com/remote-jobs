### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### You will:

  * Coach, mentor, and strengthen a team of 10 QA engineers to meet the needs of diverse teams while developing skills and increasing impact
  * Support current and emerging coaches in their roles
  * Work closely with the Supergroup leadership team to understand the product roadmap and align on test strategy
  * Build out timelines and plan test activities across multiple strategies to support company launch events.
  * Identify opportunities to improve quality in the group, and set goals and drive actions for the T&E QA team
  * Guide and inspire QA Engineers to increase their impact by setting growth goals around FE automation, risk-based testing, mobile, performance, security and API testing skills
  * Work closely with other QA leads to set and drive QA goals across the Teams & Education supergroup and the QA Subspecialty
  * Perform structured performance reviews, conduct regular 1:1s, and participate in the hiring process of new QA engineers

### You're probably a match if

  * You have a history of success in technical people leadership and mentorship of QA engineers.
  * You have experience working with product teams and defining the QA process for your team. This may involve looking at the current development process for each team, identifying opportunities for injecting quality, and advocating for process changes to improve product quality
  * You have exceptional stakeholder management skills, you can drive a QA roadmap forward and proactively rally a team around it while driving alignment with stakeholders.
  * You have exceptional problem-solving skills, with the ability to break large projects down into smaller ones, define clear outcomes and measures of success, and deliver on them through others.
  * You have experience with defining QA metrics, setting ambitious targets and driving actions to reach them
  * You have experience testing complex web and mobile apps (iOS and Android). You are meticulous in your work and passionate about testing. You consider every possible scenario during exploratory testing and can spot bugs that others might not notice. 
  * Youâ€™re capable of leading by example - promoting Canvaâ€™s values, no-blame mentality, and engineering values

### Not a must, but a big plus if:

  * You have FE and Mobile test automation experience and/or have automated trivial tasks using a scripting language like Bash or Python. You have a good understanding of what needs to be included in unit, integration, and end-to-end tests and can coach engineers on what needs to be automated.
