###  **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we‚Äôre driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the ‚Äúinverse‚Äù way in a legacy system‚Äîfocusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds‚Äîan experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it‚Äôs holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

###  **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
