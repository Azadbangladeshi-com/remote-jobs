### About the role

Muon is seeking a Testbed Hardware Engineer to join our team of testbed engineers. The ideal candidate is interdisciplinary and has a strong inclination toward good hardware execution. Weâ€™re looking for someone who can elevate the quality and aid in scaling our critical Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) avionics test platforms to support increasingly capable satellite programs. Due to the hands-on nature of this role, we do require candidates to be local to the Bay Area.

### Responsibilities

  * Conceive of, design, and implement Hardware-In-The-Loop (HITL) testbed hardware for system-level testing of software features and releases
  * Collaborate with domain experts (Electrical Engineering, Systems, Flight and Ground Software) to determine testbed hardware needs and translate into requirements.
  * Translate satellite avionics design information from system block diagrams, electrical schematics and production drawings into testbed hardware designs.
  * Synthesize and document testbed execution plans including well defined phases, and selection of milestones with rationale for each
  * Generate and maintain testbed architecture diagrams, capturing avionics electronic hardware components, interfaces to external devices such as comms interfaces
  * Coordinate with Supply Chain, Assembly, Integration and Test teams to manage flow of testbed inventory, and build processes of testbed modules.
  * Advance testbed hardware from early development to mature lifecycle phases and collaborate with facilities manager to maintain testbed support resources (network, power, GPS) onsite

### Qualifications

  * A bachelorâ€™s degree or higher in an engineering program from an accredited college or university, or equivalent experience.
  * 2+ years of hands-on experience implementing hardware in some kind of complex electromechanical system (e.g. aviation, space, automotive, robotics).
  * Experience with Harness CAD tools and harness assembly
  * Experience with PCBA assembly and rework (surface mount, through-hole)
  * Experience with light manufacturing with soft metals (e.g. drilling and tapping holes), proper use of torque wrenches
  * Familiarity with basic electrical test tools, such as a multimeter
  * Experience hands-on debugging hardware in large, complex electronic systems
  * Excellent communication and presentation skills
  * Excited to work in a fast-paced environment with new challenges each week

### Nice-to-have Skills

  * Experience with Linux Command Line tools such as Bash scripting or Python
  * Experience with Mechanical CAD tools (Solidworks Preferred)
  * Experience with Electrical CAD tools (Altium Preferred)
  * Familiarity with electronic test and measurement tools (e.g. oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, harness tester).
