### About Ping Identity:

At Ping Identity, we believe in making digital experiences both secure and seamless for all users, without compromise. We call this digital freedom. And it's not just something we provide our customers. It's something that inspires our company. People don't come here to join a culture that's built on digital freedom. They come to cultivate it.

Our intelligent, cloud identity platform lets people shop, work, bank, and interact wherever and however they want. Without friction. Without fear.

While protecting digital identities is at the core of our technology, protecting individual identities is at the core of our culture. We champion every identity. One of our core values, Respect Diversity, reminds us to celebrate differences so you are empowered to bring your authentic self to work.

We're headquartered in Denver, Colorado and we have offices and employees around the globe. We serve the largest, most demanding enterprises worldwide, including more than half of the Fortune 100. At Ping Identity, we're changing the way people and businesses think about cybersecurity, digital experiences, and identity and access management.

As a Sales Engineer at Ping Identity, you will bring a passion for and understanding of Identity, as well as delivering customer success. Remotely located, you will work alongside regional sales account executives as part of a highly effective global sales engineering team on engaging and interactive customer-focused meetings, demonstrations, and proof of concepts that articulate the business, technical, value, and future value benefits a customer will gain from a Ping Identity solution. You will be an energetic member of a team that empowers personal, team, and customer success.

As an Associate Sales Engineer in the Enterprise SE team, you will have the opportunity to develop and exercise deep technical and consultative skills while leveraging your interpersonal, relationship-building, presentation, and listening skills to engage with customers throughout pre-sales phases of customer engagement. You will work alongside an extremely capable and diverse team of your peers mentored and supported by our Solution Specialists: some of our most talented and experienced SEs. Joining the SE hub offers a fantastic opportunity to work alongside some of the best practitioners in the identity space and fast track your career development. Responsibilities:

  * Ability to relate proposed solution technical capabilities back to customer needs in a narrative style.
