### Data Science Intern

The Render Foundation is actively seeking a Data Science Intern interested in analyzing extensive user data to extract actionable insights for enhancing community service within the Render Network. This internship is perfect for someone passionate about data analysis and eager to explore the potential of Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) in deciphering and optimizing the complex interactions of a decentralized digital art creation network.

### About Us

Supporting the innovative Render Network, the Render Foundation is at the intersection of blockchain technology and digital art creation. Our goal is to foster an environment where digital artists can thrive, supported by a network that is both efficient and responsive to their needs.

### The Role

As a Data Science Intern, you will play a crucial role in analyzing user interaction data across various dimensions of the Render Network, including network tiers, assigners, pricing, bandwidth usage, and overall rendering options utilization. Your primary focus will be on applying ABM to simulate the Render Network's ecosystem, aiming to uncover insights that could lead to improved structure and governance.

### What We're Looking For

An analytical and curious mind, driven by the challenge of understanding complex systems through data. You should have a foundational knowledge of statistical analysis and data mining, coupled with an enthusiasm for learning and applying ABM in a real-world context.

### Key Responsibilities

  * Conduct comprehensive analysis of historical user data to identify trends, behaviors, and opportunities for network optimization.

  * Develop Agent-Based Models to simulate various aspects of the Render Network, aiming to predict outcomes of different structural or policy changes.

  * Work closely with our team of data scientists, engineers, and product managers to translate data insights into actionable recommendations.

  * Engage in continuous learning to stay updated on the latest data science techniques and ABM methodologies.

### Requirements

  * Currently enrolled in or recently graduated from a degree program related to data science, statistics, computer science, or a similar field.

  * A keen interest in data analysis, statistical modeling, and the application of data science to solve complex problems.

  * Basic proficiency in programming languages used in data science (Python, R) and an eagerness to learn more.

  * Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work collaboratively with a team.

### Preferred Qualifications

  * A basic understanding of or interest in blockchain technology, decentralized systems, and digital content creation.

  * Enthusiasm for the Render Network and its mission to revolutionize digital art creation through technology.

  * Previous experience with or coursework related to Agent-Based Modeling is a plus.
