_**About Nascentâ€¦**_

Founded in 2020, Nascent exists to build, expand, and capture opportunity, in open markets and permissionless technologies. Building from a base of permanent capital, we deploy assets across a range of both liquid and long-term strategies that ensure we are among the most active users of the open financial system we are helping to build. We've made venture investments in 50+ early-stage teams that we believe have the potential to create substantive change, expand boundaries, and find new horizons. We are consistently on the hunt for the most competitive and curious minds exploring the edges of the crypto ecosystem and leverage our hyper flexible structure to accelerate ideas into fully deployed strategies.

_**The Opportunity**_

As a Trader on our Liquid Strategies team, youâ€™ll be responsible for managing the day-to-day of our liquid portfolio, from identifying compelling trading opportunities to collaborating and building new proprietary trading technologies and tools.
