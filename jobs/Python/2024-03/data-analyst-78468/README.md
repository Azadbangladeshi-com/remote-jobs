Description

**What Data @ Hive looks like**

The Data & Analytics team sits within Operations, and exists to enhance decision making across Hive. We are a relatively new team, and our focus for the last few months has been on building out the infrastructure to support reporting and analysis. We now have the foundational stack in place (Airbyte, Snowflake, dbt, Metabase), and need to build our analytical capacity to put the data to good use.

 **What youâ€™ll get up to:**

Data Analysis & Reporting

  * Partnering with leaders across Hive to understand & document reporting requirements

  * Collaborating with our Analytics Engineer to develop the data models and analysis required to answer the businessâ€™ highest priority questions

  * Building, updating, troubleshooting and maintaining dashboards and reports

  * Presenting findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical team members and stakeholders

  * Educating and training business stakeholders to interpret and action the insights provided

Ad-hoc analysis

  * Prioritizing and responding to incoming analytical requests from across Hive

  * Developing SQL queries and performing data analysis

 **Who you are:**

  * 4+ years of progressive experience in an analytical role

  * Intermediate SQL skills (e.g. window functions, CTEs, query optimization, joins)

  * Experience with or exposure to data modeling with SQL (we use dbt)

  * Proficiency in data visualization and storytelling

  * Proven hands-on experience with analytical tools, being able to gather, analyze, identify and articulate insights from data

  * Excellent communication skills with the ability to present findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

  * Self-starter, with the ability to work collaboratively in a fast-paced, distributed team environment

  * High attention to detail

  * Passion for data and analytics and the value of data-driven decision making

This is a remote role within Canada or the US. As such, you must be legally entitled to work within your country of residence. Unfortunately, at this time, we are unable to hire within Quebec.

**Nice to haves:**

  * SaaS or subscription business analytics experience

  * Experience working at a company at a similar stage to Hive - fledgling analytics, figuring things out as we go

  * Experience with Python

  * Experience with our data stack (dbt, Snowflake, Airbyte, Hex)

Bottom line... We're looking for curious, hardworking, down-to-earth people passionate about helping brands build enduring customer relationships. You'll be well taken care of with meaningful equity, salary, and the benefits you need to be happy & healthy.

 **Comp/Benefits Package**

  * Meaningful salary and equity: you're rewarded based on impact

    * The compensation range for this role is $90,000 to $130,000. This compensation range takes into account a wide range of factors that are considered in making compensation decisions including but not limited to job-related skills, experience and relevant training, and business and organizational needs. The band reflects potential growth in role and new team members, when hired with the expectations listed in the posting, will come in closer to the midpoint ($110,000 - $115,000).

  * Work fully remote in Canada or the US: where youâ€™re most productive whether that be from your house, or elsewhere. We just ask that you have the legal work authorization in the country that you reside & work within. Unfortunately, we are unable to hire within Quebec at this time.

  * Flexible work hours: choose your 9-5 as long as itâ€™s not disruptive to your role, team, and Hive

  * Health Insurance: Comprehensive health & dental coverage with a parental leave top-up program

  * Open vacation/PTO policy: so you can be happy and healthy!
