### LeoLabs  
#### `üí∞ 343000.0` `üåé United States`  
About UsLeoLabs is the world‚Äôs leading commercial provider of low Earth orbit (LEO) mapping and Space Domain Awareness (SDA) services. LeoLabs was founded in 2016 as a venture-funded spinout of Silicon Valley research pioneer, SRI International, by scientists and space industry veterans committed to securing Low Earth Orbit (LEO). LeoLabs is built on 30+ years of R&D in radar systems and satellite tracking algorithms. The team is rapidly expanding its global radar network and data services platform to help satellite operators deploy their services safely and to empower governmental space agencies with detailed visibility into the LEO ecosystem. As commercial space ventures and newly-formed space agencies from every corner of the globe compete for their place in the second space race, LeoLabs is here to address a new generation of risks and opportunities to preserve LEO for future generations.  
The Opportunity LeoLabs is hiring a senior radar signal processing engineer to develop, implement, and deploy new digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms for our world class network of phased-array radars. LeoLabs operates a global network of radars to map Low Earth Orbit as the foundation of our tech stack. Your technical contributions will directly benefit our data and analytical services - supporting over 70% of operational satellites in LEO. The ideal candidate will design and deploy DSP algorithms for a variety of phased-array radar systems.  
Qualifications‚óè BS in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, or another technical field‚óè Minimum of 5 years of on-the-job experience in sensor data processing‚óè Significant, demonstrable experience using Python, C, or C++‚óè Demonstrated experience in the design, development, and deployment of industrial or enterprise-grade DSP algorithms  
Preferred qualifications‚óè Experience prototyping DSP algorithms in Python or Matlab‚óè Experience in developing and deploying DSP algorithms for GPUs‚óè Experience in implementing DSP algorithms on FPGAs‚óè Desired experience in some (not all) of the following areas:o Radar target parameter estimation (range, velocity, angle-or-arrival, etc.)o FIR filter design and implementationo Experience working with raw complex IQ datao Tracking algorithm development (e.g. Kalman filters)o Detection and estimation theory (e.g. CFAR detector development)o Probability and statistics / Monte Carlo simulations  
Within 1 month, you‚Äôll:‚óè Complete our onboarding program designed to get you up to speed on our business, vision and team‚óè Gain an understanding about how your role fits into LeoLabs broader organization‚óè Ramp up on LeoLabs engineering stack  
Within 3 months, you‚Äôll:‚óè Develop and implement advanced DSP algorithms for the real-time processing of phased-array radar data‚óè Lead a deployment of your own code to the radar network‚óè Join our on-call rotation, supporting our global network of radars  
Within 6 months, you‚Äôll:‚óè Select DSP architectures that optimize data throughput‚óè Work on developing new modes of radar tracking‚óè Improve monitoring of data streams coming through the system  
Within 12 months, you‚Äôll:‚óè Be responsible for all parts of the LeoLabs DSP Pipeline‚óè Help make decisions about future radar software projects‚óè Work closely with the hardware team for future improvements
