# About One

One's mission is simple ‚Äî financial progress. We‚Äôre doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, and grow their money ‚Äî all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can‚Äôt access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world‚Äôs largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There‚Äôs never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!

# Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we‚Äôve adopted a flat titling structure at One.

Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. ‚ÄúEngineer, Platform‚Äù, ‚ÄúSales, Business Development‚Äù or ‚ÄúManager, Talent‚Äù). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within One.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.
