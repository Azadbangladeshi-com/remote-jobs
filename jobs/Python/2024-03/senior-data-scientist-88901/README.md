  * Work with raw energy consumption and device data - ingest, organize, and transform this data into structures that enable downstream applications

###  **Requirements:**

  * Ability to go the full data cycle: source data inputs, build and tune a model/data product, deploy that model into a product, and measure impact to inform future development

  * Demonstrated experience implementing statistical and machine learning models in a customer facing application with proven business impact

  * High levels of competency with Python & SQL

  * Familiarity with a dbt/Snowflake data stack

  * Top notch communication and interpersonal skills
