**EquipmentShare is Hiring a Senior Machine Learning Engineer**

EquipmentShare is searching for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join our team. This position is fully remote.

 **What Youâ€™ll Do as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer**

Despite having been fundamentally altered by earlier industrial revolutions, the construction industry has hardly budged with the computer revolution. In fact, since 1970, labor productivity in the US construction industry has actually declined, despite it more than doubling in the rest of the economy. This has contributed to housing shortages and the parlous state of infrastructure in some places, and is sanding the gears of carbon reduction efforts.

We think the industry is ripe for change, and weâ€™re pushing the leading edge of that change with our next generation T3 Platform, the OS for Construction. Through T3, we help contractors to coordinate humans and (increasingly smarter) machines to build more effectively.

As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in our small and quickly growing team, you will play a major role in this effort. In particular, you will:

  * Increase the velocity of scientific exploration, experimentation and ML development at EquipmentShare by developing tools that enable full-stack data science.
  * Help with build vs buy decisions and integration planning.
  * Help shape best practices within the team, along with mentoring and developing junior data platform engineers.

### About You as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer

In turn, our employees have every opportunity to grow with us, achieve personal and professional success and enjoy making a tangible difference in a crucial industry for human welfare.
