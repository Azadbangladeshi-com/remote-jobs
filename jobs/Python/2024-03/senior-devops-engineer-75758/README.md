**The Platform**

Decentraland is the worldâ€™s first fully decentralized, Ethereum blockchain-based virtual world, built, governed and owned by its users. Itâ€™s a truly unique ecosystem with its own decentralized autonomous organization, currency, marketplace and system of property â€“ and itâ€™s growing fast! New creations are added daily by creators who use proprietary developer tools to make games, puzzles, scenes, artworks â€“ whatever their imaginations allow. Via their personal avatars, users attend live music events, conferences, exhibitions, dance parties and other experiences every day of the year. What began as a proof-of-concept for assigning ownership of digital real estate to users of a blockchain is now an immersive, ever-expanding and richly detailed metaverse, where anything is possible.
