  * Gather, document and design data integration and data visualization requirements for workloads ranging from small to enterprise size.
  * Provide technical recommendations on the development and implementation of data-related standards.
  * Maintain expertise in skills related to dashboard production, like demographics, geocoding, and data enhancement.
  * Develop Power BI Data models and recommend best practices for report creation and visualizations.

### Skills & Experience

  * A tertiary qualification in Computer Science, Software Development, Data Science, or certification in relevant BI technologies.
  * A sound understanding of BI best practices, relational structures, star schemas, dimensional data modelling, denormalization processes, and reporting techniques including MS Power BI.

  * Attention to detail, goal-driven, good communication, strong problem-solving ability, challenge-loving, and a knowledge sponge.
  * Strong documentation skills.
  * Engineering mindset.
