### Coinbase  
#### `üí∞ 285825.0` `üåé United States`  

At Coinbase, our mission is toincrease economic freedom around the world, and we couldn‚Äôt do this without hiring the best people. We‚Äôre a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they‚Äôre trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That‚Äôs us.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in aculture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to ourmission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We‚Äôre a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.

### Ready to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:

  * You‚Äôve got positive energy. You‚Äôre optimistic about the future and determined to get there. 
  * You‚Äôre never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0. 
  * You appreciate direct communication. You‚Äôre both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let‚Äôs face it, you can‚Äôt have one without the other. You‚Äôre cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
  * You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You‚Äôre not looking for a boring job.
  * You have a ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn‚Äôt scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
  * You want to be part of a winning team. We‚Äôre stronger together, and you‚Äôre a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone. 

### Security Operations Team

Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations Team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we go to battle against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trustworthy experience.

As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation and strategic team growth to ensure that we‚Äôre well-equipped to protect the next billion crypto users.

### What you‚Äôll be doing:

The Security Operations Team is a multi-functional organization that includes Trust Safety, CSIRT, Threat Intelligence and Insider Threat. While no two days will look the same, as the operations manager within the Trust Safety team you‚Äôll be responsible for the following:

  *  **Knowledge management.** You‚Äôll wrangle an ever-changing landscape of threats, responses, and processes; you are an expert at capturing information, simplifying it, and sharing out to a team of 50+.
  *  **Continuous improvement.** You are able to analyze existing processes and optimize for both accuracy and efficiency. You‚Äôre able to independently identify which processes have the greatest opportunity for improvement and work with SMEs to improve them.
  *  **Cross-functional execution**. Your work touches many teams (engineering, product, legal, customer experience); you‚Äôre excited about understanding what each team needs to succeed and you are able to harmonize those needs into a single package that helps all of Coinbase.
  *  **Large vendor team motivation**. You are experienced in motivating large teams of agents to be top performers.

### What we look for in you:

Some security teams have strict requirements about certifications, degrees, years of experience, and things like that. Not us! We‚Äôre more interested in the unique perspectives and expertise you‚Äôll bring to the team rather than the acronyms on your resume. However, you‚Äôll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these points seem like a good description of you:

  * Relevant experience with increasing responsibility within a Trust Safety or integrity team, 5+ years working on Trust Safety related projects
  * You‚Äôre an operator at heart and are comfortable building and managing processes, scaling knowledge and process across large teams, and communicating clearly to XFN teams
  * You have knowledge-management experience; you have built knowledge bases, created trainings, and upskilled at least 100+ people in your career so far
  * You have deep knowledge of continuous improvement and have taken existing processes from one-off to efficient scaled solutions
  * You‚Äôre comfortable doing data analysis (e.g., SQL, Python) to help drive decision making
  * You frequently get praise from your peers and coworkers about your communication skills, both written and verbal
  * You can translate complex findings and results into a concise and compelling narrative

### Nice to haves:

  * Six Sigma Green Belt or equivalent experience in data driven process improvement
  * You‚Äôve been doing practical security things (detection and response, phishkit/malware analysis, security research, etc) for a bit now, in the realm of 2+ years
  * You would bring a diverse perspective to the team: for example you took an unconventional route to get into your current Trust and Safety career
  * You‚Äôve got at least a passing familiarity with blockchains and cryptocurrency, or just a good story about how you thought about investing in Bitcoin in 2014 but decided not to
  * You‚Äôve worked on or have thought deeply about Internet-based risk, abuse, fraud, data protection or security
