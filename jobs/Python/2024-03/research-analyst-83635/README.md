### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### How do I get in touch?

Please apply & weâ€™ll be in touch! If your resume and background appear like a good match, we will reach out for an initial phone screen.

### Where is Cypris located?

Cypris has offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Boulder. However, we offer the ability to work 100% remotely.

We believe that releasing ourselves from sourcing talent from one physical boundary opens the talent pool for us to find the very best & most ambitious team members no matter where they are.

### What are Cypris' future hiring plans?

We're always looking for the best talent across departments. We will regularly post new job opportunities on the Cypris Careers page, Wellfound, or LinkedIn.

### How does Cypris make money?

We sell annual access to our dashboard to R&D, innovation & IP teams looking to better understand the innovation landscape. We also build custom reports for objective-oriented projects. Both can be included in one package.

What does the interview process look like?

The process depends on the role. For all positions, weâ€™ll start with an introduction call with our Talent team.

From there, the interview process will vary by role. We typically do a longer call with one of our team members who can appropriately vet your skills & "speak your language" - on the engineering side, this might mean some technical questions, while on the sales side, weâ€™ll ask you to build a quick presentation about yourself.

Finally, weâ€™ll check over a few references. If youâ€™re near one of our offices, we may give you the opportunity to meet in person.
