Youâ€™ll have ownership and input on a combination of innovative, challenging projects and ongoing support engagementsâ€”we believe in balanced and diverse workloads through dedicated resource management. We have a supportive Client Delivery structure, with established PM processes, while still allowing for autonomy.

As a leading digital agency, 10upâ€™s client roster spans from innovative startups and impactful non-profits, to some of the biggest names in the industry, such as ESPN, Google, The New York Times Co., and The Nobel Prize Committee.

Successfully create and execute project plans to deliver fixed price, retainer, and TM projects within expected timelines and budgets.
  * Ensure superior quality deliverables by collaboratively engaging cross-discipline leadership, and enforcing rigorous QA processes and standards to provide end to end delivery and client satisfaction.
  * Lead discovery engagements (onsite and remotely) that expertly define cross-discipline project requirements and that demonstrate an expert understanding of underlying client business goals and objectives. Consistently identify strategic opportunities to engage with the 10up Account Management Team and collaborate towards building strong, long-term client relationships.

  * You love a challenge - whether that be a complex project or client - you are at your best when creating and delivering strategic solutions. 
  * You possess superior project awareness at all times; proactively tracking project budget and scope, identifying risks and mitigation paths, and delivering thoughtful, routine, comprehensive client updates.
  * You demonstrate a senior-level consultative, client-focused approach that emanates expertise, professionalism, and transparency.
  * You have excellent verbal and written English communication skills, both internally and externally. You are comfortable engaging and working with members of leadership to resolve conflicts and/or risks.

### Benefits of interest:
