### Resultant  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### Company Description

Resultant is a modern consulting firm with a radically different approach to solving problems.

 **We donâ€™t solve problems** ** _for_ our clients. We solve problems ****_with_ them.**

Through outcomes driven by data analytics, technology solutions, digital transformation, and beyond, our team works with clients in both the public and private sectors to solve their most complex challenges. We start by learning as much as we can about who they are, how they work, and what theyâ€™re striving for so we can feel their problems as our own. Partnering with our clients means their desired outcomes are always top of mind, their challenges and strengths guiding our efforts. We build client-focused relationships before we build unique solutions that blaze past expectations.

Originally founded in Indianapolis as KSM Consulting in 2008, Resultant now employs more than 350 team members who operate from offices around the United States including Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and Odon, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; Lansing, Michigan; Denver, Colorado; Dallas, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia.

 **Weâ€™re Resultant. Clients partner with us to see a difference. People join us to make one.**
