Description

**Description**

Jump is the only end-to-end fan experience platform built for sports teams and venues, breaking the mold for what fans can expect at live events.

Jumpâ€™s enterprise software enables sports teams and venues to unlock the massive opportunities that come from real relationships with their fans, rethinking the traditional model that hasnâ€™t put the fan experience first.

Founded in 2021 by Marc Lore, Alex Rodriguez, and Jordy Leiser and backed by top venture firms including Forerunner Ventures, Will Ventures, Mastry Ventures, Courtside Ventures, and more, weâ€™re just getting started!

We are a remote first team that grounds our actions and decisions in our core values â€” begin with trust, bring our all, and blaze a trail. Living our values means that we always assume positive intent, show up with authenticity and empathy, and push the limit of what is possible with our collective creativity.

Weâ€™re actively recruiting for smart, tenacious, adaptable, and most importantly kind people to join our team!
