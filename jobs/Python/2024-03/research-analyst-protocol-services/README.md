### **About Messari.**

Messari is the leading provider of crypto market intelligence products that help professionals navigate crypto/Web3 with confidence. We bring transparency and smarter qualitative and quantitative analytics to the industry by combining a global research database with a comprehensive suite of data visualization and asset discovery tools. We help drive smarter participation in crypto from individuals and institutions alike.

The name ‚ÄúMessari‚Äù came from the Franciscan monks who declared "clean books" a moral imperative during the renaissance and pushed merchants to use proper accounting methods. This led to the flourishing of investment via "trust but verify" methods and industry growth throughout Europe. **That's what we aim to do. Provide participants, investors, builders, platforms, and everyone else with reliable information to better participate in the crypto ecosystem.**

Our users range from some of the most prominent analysts, investors, and crypto individuals to top organizations including Coinbase, BitGo, Anchorage, 0x, Chainanalysis, Ledger, Compound, MakerDAO, and many more.

###  **The Role**

Messari‚Äôs Protocol Services provides independent and objective research for the benefit of crypto projects‚Äô community members and stakeholders. Our research analysts offer in-depth, data-driven research coverage of key crypto networks and protocols. The reports highlight key information and data-driven insights crypto communities need to make informed decisions. Our flagship product is the Quarterly Report which is a data-driven point-in-time snapshot of the usage and financial performance of a crypto project. We currently cover more than 50 projects including many blue chips. You can find our research reports here. Analysts work closely together with our data engineers who are responsible for gathering raw data from internal and external data sources and turn these into metrics.
