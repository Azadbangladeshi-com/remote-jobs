# [Senior Solutions Architect](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-solutions-architect-88593)  
### Lumos  
#### `💰 $140,000 - $180,000` `🌎 Worldwide`  

In 2011, Mark Andreessen famously said, “Software is eating the world.” 10+ years later, software hasn’t just nibbled, it has indulged in a lavish ten-course feast at a Michelin star restaurant. From Slack to Zoom to Figma, software is embedded in every company’s DNA. And while most just get to enjoy the benefits, there is one unsung hero behind it all: **🦸‍♀️ IT 🦸‍♀️**

While being flooded with never ending IT tickets, they are also making sure Guy Fieri in Sales doesn’t buy yet another tool “promising” a 103% lead conversion rate. And burying themselves in spreadsheets to prepare the SOC2 report for when Gordon Ramsey from the Big 4 comes knocking. And can’t forget about Julia Child, the newest on-call engineer, who needs access to prod DB to investigate an incident. All of these workstreams are among spreadsheets, emails, Slack messages, and Zoom calls. But those days are numbered.

✨ **Let there be Lumos** ✨

Lumos is building the first AppHQ for companies. In essence, we are creating the meta app, the source-of-truth for companies to manage all their apps.

**Why Lumos?**

  * 🚀 **Rocketship Growth** : In less than two years, our team has grown from 20 to ~80 brilliant minds across Canada, the United States and South America. Our customer base has more than 10x’d with some pretty incredible names like SiriusXM, GitHub, and Intercom.
  * 📈 **Backed by Industry Leaders** : Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has backed us since the beginning. We have a team of trusted advisors including Joel De La Garza (partner at a16z and previous Chief Security Officer at Box) and Leland Maschmeyer (the design thinker behind Spotify and Microsoft)
  * **⭐ Grow with us** : You have the chance to be one of the first 100 people at Lumos. At Lumos, you will build your function from the ground up, get exposure to different aspects of the business developing a diverse skill set, and most importantly, you’ll have the opportunity to pave your own path.

We are rewriting the IT playbook, one that better reflects our software eaten world.

As a Solutions Architect, you will be our champion bringing customers onto the platform, working closely between sales, customer success, product, and engineering. Furthermore, you'll gain leadership opportunities early-on, by helping grow the team and scaling our technical go-to-market motion, the product, and the company!

✨ Your Responsibilities

  * Architect deployments of Lumos for our most complex customers and assist the success team in driving customers to achieve a fully onboarded state.
  * Drive technical and process investments to scale our success and go to market teams, collaborating closely with our product and engineering teams, and increase our ability to implement quickly and support excellently our growing number of customers.
  * Contribute to the change management process required of our customers. Serve as a trusted advisor who helps navigate blockers to adoption.
  * Identify critical bottlenecks and automate the onboarding process. Shape our approach to the customer self-service experience. Build processes and documentation that allow customers to accelerate their time to value.
  * Serve as a subject matter expert on the market Lumos is a part of and use cases it supports. Report internally on market trends, customer success stories, and common issues & complaints you are seeing.

⛰ Your Skills

  * **Technical Knowledge (SQL, Python)** : This role requires fluency in SQL and comfort reading python. Lumos is a highly technical product with a technical customer base, and you’re able to quickly acclimate to this environment. Sufficient knowledge of working in a terminal, database models, APIs, infrastructure, and frontend to debug problems, help direct engineering effort, and resolve issues.
  * **High-Agency Customer Champion** : You’re excited to work closely with prospects and customers, and are skilled at empowering others. Are empathetic and gain energy from interacting closely with customers. You’ll go the extra mile to make customers feel excited and supported when working with us. Yet you are also able to push back when needed, and can effectively influence others and objection handle concerns.
  * **Analytical Builder** : You start by understanding customer problems before proposing solutions. You enjoy working in ambiguity and are comfortable creating clarity and structure around you as needed. You are detail- and process-oriented. You think analytically to understand bottlenecks and _what_ is the right problem to solve. When it’s time for solutioning, you push for automation, yet also know when to do things that don’t scale.
  * **Excellent Communicator** : Excellent commercial communication skills (written, oral, and presentation). Promote a sense of confidence about Lumos within customers and wow them in interactions! Translate business needs into technical requirements, and articulate product features in terms of customers’ goals.

💰Pay Range

  * $140,000 - $180,000. _Note that this range is a good faith estimate of likely pay for this role; upon hire, the pay may differ due to skill and/or level of experience._

🙌 What We Value

We’re looking for a generalist solutions engineer/architect, ideally with startup experience in B2B enterprise SaaS tech. Having said this, we care much more about your motivation and excitement to grow into the role than we care just about your CV.

Instead of focusing on what people need to have, we focus on what people need to do. Additionally, we try to find out whether you would be a good fit for Lumos based on our values that define how we achieve outcomes and what characteristics we value.

Thank you for considering Lumos! 🎉

* _We encourage you to apply even if you think you might not be perfect fit! 🤝_
