Description

## **SUPERHUMAN 👉**

  * The fastest email experience in the world
  * Loved and adored: see what our customers say

Our customers get through their inboxes twice as fast; many see inbox zero for the first time in years.

Come shape the future of email, communication, and productivity!

## **BUILD LOVE 💜**

At Superhuman, we deeply understand how to build products that people love. We incorporate fun and play; we infuse magic and joy; we make experiences that amaze and delight.

It all starts with the right team — a team that deeply cares about values, customers, and each other.

## **CREATE MASSIVE IMPACT 🚀**

We're not solving a small problem, and we're not addressing a small market. We're going after email; the one activity that consumes more of our work day than any other.

Our ambition doesn't stop there. Next: calendars, notes, contacts, and tasks. We are building the productivity platform of the future.

## **DO THE BEST WORK OF YOUR LIFE 🌟**

We have created the frameworks for how to build product market fit and redefined the narrative of how to onboard customers successfully. We have shown the world it’s possible to build a premium productivity brand. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, IVP, Tiger Global Management, Sam Altman, and the founders of Gmail, Dropbox, Reddit, Discord, Stripe, GitHub, AngelList, and Intercom.

Our latest financing was led by IVP, and we welcomed Ajay Vashee to our board. Our prior financing was led by Andreessen Horowitz, and we welcomed Marc Andreessen and David Ulevitch to our board.

This time, we’re swinging beyond the fences and fundamentally rethinking how individuals and teams should collaborate. We are building a household brand and a worldwide organization. We are here to do the best work of our lives, and we hope you are too.
