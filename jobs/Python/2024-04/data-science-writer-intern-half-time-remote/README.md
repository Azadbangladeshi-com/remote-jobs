NannyML ‚Äî creators of the NannyML Open Source Python library, are looking for multiple Data Science Writer interns to help with Data Science content creation, research, and prototyping.

###  _ **About Us**_

NannyML builds products for post-deployment data science. We focus on detecting model performance degradation without needing access to ground-truth data. We have researched and developed state-of-the-art algorithms that now form part of our OSS library and the NannyML Cloud product.

The founders are experienced entrepreneurs who previously founded a specialized machine learning company, where they became experts at building machine learning systems. At NannyML, we take pride in hiring the best people and getting out of their way so that they can make great things happen.

We are backed by tech leaders who have founded and grown top data unicorns, like the co-founder of Collibra (the first Belgian unicorn), Zehan Wang (ex-head of Cortex AI at Twitter); and deep tech VCs like Lunar Ventures. At NannyML, we are building Free Open Source Software to estimate the performance of ML models after deployment. We‚Äôre creating a one-of-a-kind company by being one of the initial players in the growing ML Monitoring field. By focusing on post-deployment data science and performance estimation, we‚Äôll define the industry and science for decades to come.

###  **About the Role**

We are looking for Data Science Writer interns to help the Research and Growth team create niche-defining content.

  * Write both long-form and short-form original content about ML Monitoring, NannyML products, and general applied Data Science
  * Curate content across new ML developments, foundational papers, and practical data science

###  **Our Values**

We value freedom with responsibility, transparency, and a growth mindset. We believe in generating our own luck by trying out new stuff, always asking, constantly learning, reading, and meeting new people with different world-views. We appreciate that from time to time, things may break. Working at NannyML, you will have full autonomy to make impactful decisions and prioritize and organize your work the way you see fit.
