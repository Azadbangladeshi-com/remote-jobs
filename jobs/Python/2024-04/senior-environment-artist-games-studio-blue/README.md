Weâ€™re looking for a creative and highly-skilled Senior Environment Artist to help us forge the creative vision on a brand-new AAA multi-platform (PC, mobile, etc.) game. This is a unique opportunity to be at the heart of crafting and bringing to life worlds for one of Netflixâ€™s first generation of internally developed original games.

As Senior Environment Artist, you will help us define overall quality and construct 3D environments to deliver consistent, high-quality environmental assets and locations. The ideal candidate is a well organized artist with a strong, hands-on background with a devotion for sharing and mentoring. This role will involve producing striking, high quality and optimized AAA environments.

We're building the foundation for a small, but ambitious, team of creators whoâ€™s primary goal is to create a game experience that our players want to repeatedly come back to; and as our Senior Environment Artist, you will be able to create, ship, and run a game without any competing design constraints due to monetization.

Quality is something that we are immensely proud to be aiming for, and we are looking at putting the right team together to help take us forward. Weâ€™re looking for that group of artists who are aligned with our core values, and care deeply about the experiences they create as well as the people they make them with.
