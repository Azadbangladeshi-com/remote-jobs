We are looking for an adaptable and inquisitive Senior Software Engineer to join Voltron Dataâ€™s team. On the team, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to help guide, measure, and contribute to the Voltron Data and Apache Arrow ecosystems. Voltron Data is fundamentally data-driven, and this team is at the core of running, measuring, persisting, and communicating what drives our development and product improvements. You will build tools and infrastructure to measure, analyze and make data-backed decisions. This work will be very collaborative: youâ€™ll work with Data Scientists with expertise in data analysis and data communication, youâ€™ll work with developers of Arrow and other Voltron Data software, and youâ€™ll work with product managers who need to access and understand the metrics the tools you build produce.

### Why work at Voltron Data?

  *  **We are Going for Impact:** We are a Series A, venture-backed startup assembling a global team to build a new foundation for data analytics with Apache Arrow. This foundation will usher in a wave of innovation in data processing that can take full advantage of the speed and efficiency offered by modern hardware. 
  * **We are Committed to Bridging Open Source Communities:** We are a collection of open source maintainers who have been driving open source ecosystems over the last 15 years, particularly in the C++, Python, and R programming ecosystems. 
  * **We are Building a Diverse, Inclusive Company:** We are creating a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace that prioritizes employee growth. Everyone at Voltron Data is bought into the companyâ€™s success; all voices are critical to shaping the organizationâ€™s future. 

### Upon Joining:

  * Becoming familiar with current continuous benchmarking for Apache Arrow and Voltron Data
  * Learning and adopting the Apache development process

### Within a month:

  * Learn details about how we collect our current metrics, and benchmarking data
  * Build modular tools that facilitate benchmarking (both continuously and as part of developer workflows): environment and configuration collection, communication with the conbench API, basic results handling
  * Collaborate with DevOps to run benchmarks in various development environments
  * Triaging regressions and working with engineering teams to find root cause and ensuring the issue resolution. 

### Within 6 months:

  * Collaborate with Voltron Data team members to develop improve automation of benchmarking and profiling
  * Develop monitoring and alerting tools that are targeted, reliable, and actionable
  * Further iterate on modular tools that make writing, running, and reporting on benchmarks easy and reliable â€” finding what our tools are lacking and fixing, adding, and reimagining until they are a joy to use
  * Design deployment strategies for benchmarking of distributed algorithms

### Within 12 months:

  * Someone in this role will have the opportunity to grow in a number of different directions. Here is a selection of possible directions (we expect no single candidate to do all of them, and there are many areas not listed here). Specifically, you will research, design, build and implement appropriate frameworks, tools, and infrastructure for:
    * Continuous improvements of benchmarking environments by adding features in current framework to improve Theseus development and benchmarking velocity and extending benchmarking coverage. 
    * Tracing, profiling, and logging (especially ones that work well in distributed systems)
    * Performance-related research and development

### Previous experience that could be helpful:

  * Experience with Python software development
  * Experience with SQL query systems. Familiarity with data processing frameworks.
  * User-focused software development â€” having a knack for what makes something easy to use and striving to make everything that way
  * Experience building tools, with an emphasis on developing tools that are a delight to use
  * Experience with Continuous Integration and Delivery
