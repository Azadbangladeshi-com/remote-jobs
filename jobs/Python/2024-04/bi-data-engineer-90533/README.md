Reporting a Scam:  
  
Cresco Labs is aware of fictitious employment offers being circulated from various sources.

Be aware that fraudulent job offers and correspondence may appear legitimate: they may feature a Cresco Labs logo, they may appear to originate from an official-looking email address or web site, or they may be sent by individuals purporting to represent Cresco Labs or an entity which includes the word Cresco Labs in its name.  
  
Please note that Cresco Labs **does not** ask for payment or personal banking information as a condition of employment. Any personal information is requested for payroll or state badging purposes only. Applications can be securely submitted through our career‚Äôs pages.

We are working diligently to block this from happening. Beware if an offer of employment looks too good to be true. Never divulge personal and banking information or send money if you are unsure of the authenticity of an email or other communication in the name of Cresco Labs.
