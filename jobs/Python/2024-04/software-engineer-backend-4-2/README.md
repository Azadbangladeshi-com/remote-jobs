  * Collaborate with Data Engineers to define, manage, and maintain our data processing environments: development sandbox and production workflow, using tools like AWS Lambda, Jupyter Hub, and Apache Airflow

  * Integrate physical test hardware in our lab with our cloud systems

  * Architect systems to achieve low latency and fault tolerance

  * Deploy infrastructure and tools to workstations, on-premises data centers, and cloud environments

### Qualifications

  * B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in computer science or related field, or equivalent experience

  * 5+ years experience as a software engineer in a team environment

  * Strong programming experience in Python, with knowledge of industry-standard data formats and schemas (ProtoBuf, YAML, JSON, etc)

  * Experience with cloud-native software development in at least one major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) using containers

  * Excellent communication and presentation skills

  * Excited to work in a fast-paced environment with new opportunities each week

### Nice-to-have Skills

  * Experience with the Azure cloud ecosystem

  * ### Experience with IP networking

  * Have a passion for simple architectures and clean APIs

  * Experience smoothly deploying continuously evolving data services to customers
