### About Orita

Direct-to-consumer brands pay us, in order to market less.

Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less.

How? We use _a lot of math_ and _a lot of machine learning_ to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now.

When you do this, two things happen. Brands save a ton of money. And their deliverability improves (hello inbox, goodbye spam filter!).

Fewer messages sent + higher chance they will be seen = ROI goes way up.

Sounds simple, right? Well, it‚Äôs not. You try getting marketers to be less market-y. It‚Äôs way easier to ‚Äúplay it safe‚Äù and email everyone all the time. Our math has to be that good.

But you said there would be math. Yes. We said there would be math.

And that‚Äôs where you come in. We need people with amazing neural networks in their heads to help program our artificial ones. You‚Äôll be one of the founding members of our machine learning team. You‚Äôll have a huge impact on our product, our culture, and building something great from the ground up. It will be a lot of fun.

### About the Role:

You will be on a team of engineers, reporting to our CTO Zack (he has a Master‚Äôs in CS from Georgia Tech) and working closely with our CEO and Head of Product Daniel (he has a PhD in Neurobiology and has built data science teams for a decade). We look like a SaaS company. But we‚Äôre really building _the_ data science and machine learning company to support the world‚Äôs best brands.
