**What We Do**

Sometimes the solution is straightforward and sometimes it is highly complexâ€”we always rely on data to drive our solutions.

  * Architecting the data warehouse to serve many internal data consumers ( _e.g._ analysts, engineers, product managers, operations managers)
  * Building an efficient and scalable data pipeline for high-volume events in the data warehouse

**Who You Are**

  * Extensive experience with data modeling and analyzing large scale data with modern cloud computing platforms. Experience with dbt strongly preferred
  * Strong proficiency in SQL
  * Experience with data pipeline development tools in a modern data stack such as dbt, Databricks, Redshift, BigQuery, and Airflow
