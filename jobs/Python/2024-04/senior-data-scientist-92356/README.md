Description

### About us:

RevenueCat makes building, analyzing, and growing mobile subscriptions easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $2B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.

We are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.

Our 70 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to help us enable developers to make better decisions by using the unique data we have collected across the subscription ecosystem. We will do so by shipping data-enabled features, for example Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, statistical significance for our Experimentation tool, or benchmarking. This role will work closely with the product team owning our customer facing data features.

Our data tech stack currently includes our Python backend, PostgreSQL production database, Snowflake data warehouse, and dbt for data transformation. We are running on AWS.

### About you:

  * You are proficient in SQL and are comfortable with data modeling
  * You have experience building predictive models
  * You have built production-ready data pipelines and Python models
  * You are driven by creating value for customers, not just scientific accuracy and you see perfect as the enemy of done
  * You are comfortable with ambiguity, lack of structure, and an environment where you can (and have to) build a lot from scratch
  * You understand how to best convey data and insights to broad audiences to help them make better decisions
  * You are interested in the consumer mobile subscription ecosystem and are excited to explore the data we have

### In the first month, you'll:

  * Understand our data models
  * Get to know the team
  * Ramp up on the ongoing data feature work

### Within the first 3 months, you'll:

  * Meaningfully contribute to shipping a data feature to thousands of developers
  * Work with our product, analytics and engineering teams to improve our data pipelines for data science features
  * Launch your own explorations into our data to fulfill your own curiosity

### Within the first 6 months, you'll:

  * Contribute to the roadmap of the data feature team
  * Ship, own, and continuously improve predictive models powering customer facing features
  * Contribute to architecting and further developing our data tech stack

### Within the first 12 months, you'll:

  * Propose, design, and develop new data driven features from idea to shipping
  * Push the boundaries of how we are utilizing our data to help developers make more money

###  **What we offer:**

  * $176,000 USD salary regardless of your location
  * Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator
  * 10 year window to exercise vested equity options
  * Fully remote work environment that promotes autonomy and flexibility
  * Suggested 4 to 5 weeks time off to recharge and focus on mental, physical, and emotional health
  * $2,000 USD to build your personal workspace
  * $1,000 USD annual stipend for your continuous learning and growth
