Description

### Company Description

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Banking, Commerce, Staff and Customers.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes â€“ large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. Weâ€™re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own termsâ€”and weâ€™re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

### Job Description

Square Loans has revolutionized the way businesses obtain the funding needed to achieve their goals. Unlike traditional business financing products, Square Loans are extended to pre-qualified sellers. If approved after a short application, sellers receive their funds as soon as the next business day, and repayment happens as a fixed percentage of daily card sales.

Within Square Banking, the Square Loans team is working to help sellers of all sizes to get funding with their most acceptable repayment structure and bring our successful US lending products to international markets.

  4. Influence stakeholders to focus on product gaps and opportunities with quantifiable business and customer impact

  5. Identify and develop a strong understanding of lending products and ideal customer profile with data exploration

  6. Design and own business metrics for measuring lending products success

### Qualifications

You have:

  * 5+ years of Data Science or other quantitative field

  * Familiarity with product data science, understanding and tracking user behavior using analytical lenses like engagement, conversion, cohorts, segmentation and funnel analysis.

  * Experience collaborating and building relationships with cross-functional stakeholders, influencing business decisions with data.
