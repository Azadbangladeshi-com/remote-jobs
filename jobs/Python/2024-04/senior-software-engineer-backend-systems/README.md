**About the Company**

Hi, we're Ondo Finance. Our mission is to provide institutional-grade, blockchain-enabled investment products and services. We have both a technology arm that develops decentralized finance technology, and an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized funds. We were the first company to tokenize exposure to US Treasuries and have since expanded into several other assets. We are also focused on incubating protocols that can support both tokenized real-world assets and traditional crypto.

Founded by folks from Goldman Sachsâ€™s Digital Assets Team, weâ€™re backed by some of the best investors in the world including Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global, and more. We are currently the leaders in the space in terms of AUM and are well capitalized to continue to grow the firm. We're fully remote with team members across the US.

    * **Full benefits** (medical, vision, and dental) and flexible vacation policy (PTO)

#### What your responsibilities will be:

    * Researching, designing, and implementing Ondo's core products in a multi-chain Defi ecosystem
