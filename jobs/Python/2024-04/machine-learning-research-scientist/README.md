PicnicHealth is revolutionizing how life sciences companies advance medicine while providing immediate value to the patients who power the research. Through direct patient engagement, state of the art machine learning, and scientific expertise, PicnicHealth uniquely curates 100% of consenting patientsâ€™ medical records to generate the high quality and clinically-rich evidence that life sciences companies need, at a fraction of the cost of traditional study models. At the same time, we give patients immediate access to their medical records through a patient portal that simplifies participation and drives engagement. To date weâ€™ve helped tens of thousands of patients securely access their records and proactively contribute to advancing research in diseases that impact their lives.

Founded in 2014, PicnicHealth partners with 12 of the top 20 biopharma companies and has raised over $100 million in venture capital from investors including Amplify Partners, Felicis Ventures and B Capital Group.

If you are looking to join an award winning, mission-driven, motivated team that is making a real impact across millions of peopleâ€™s lives, PicnicHealth might just be the place for you.

**The Opportunity**

Machine learning is at the heart of our work and technical strategy. Our company sifts through the messy mountain of data that captures each patientâ€™s care journey in whatever format it exists in the real world. To do that, weâ€™ve built a human-in-the-loop AI/ML pipeline that ingests medical records and scans, converts them into structured data, and then synthesizes them into a form that is directly useful to patients, clinicians, and researchers. This process enables us to build products that improve patient/doctor communication and care decisions, or develop the next generation of data-driven life-sciences studies.

Our Machine Learning teamâ€™s goal is to capitalize on the latest technology to both expand our core capabilities and to improve the efficiency with which we process records in our existing pipeline. Our latest strategic initiatives have already begun putting large language models (LLMs) at the heart of our predictive techniques. We are looking for an ML Research Scientist who is fascinated by what it takes to use emerging techniques to solve real business problems today, and what it takes to launch that cutting edge tech into production at scale.
