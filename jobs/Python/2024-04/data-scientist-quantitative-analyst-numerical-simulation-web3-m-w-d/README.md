Impossible Cloud is a B2B cloud platform with a focus on becoming the #1 cloud platform in Europe and beyond. It was founded by serial entrepreneurs who have previously built a billion-euro tech company. While we build a comprehensive suite of cloud products, we are redefining the cloud sector by bridging the gap between web3 infrastructure (DePIN) and mainstream B2B cloud use cases.

  

We are committed to reinventing the internet and pushing technological innovation to the next level. Your peers include distinguished experts known for their success in web3. Additionally, you will directly work with some of Europe's most accomplished web2 entrepreneurs.

  

While remote work is available, we strongly encourage regular on-site collaboration with our exceptional team at our Hamburg headquarters.

    * Scenario Analysis: Run simulations and analyze simulation outcomes to identify risks, shortcomings, dynamics, and potentials for model improvements.
    * Parameter Optimisation: Perform sensitivity analyses and a/b testing on parameter choices, driving the optimization of protocol parameters.
    * Collaboration: Educate internal and external stakeholders on simulation techniques and outcomes. Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including engineering, business development, marketing.

  

#### What you have done

    * Proven ability to perform **model simulations** using mathematical and statistical tools. Either through relevant academic research or industry experience (e.g. in Consulting, Data Science, Technology, etc.)
    * Programming experience, ideally using industry-standard **Python** libraries (pandas, numpy, cadCAD, etc.).
    * Passion and enthusiasm for the vision and mission of Impossible Cloud and the potential impact of decentralizing cloud services.
    * A postgraduate degree in STEM/Econometrics/Quant. Finance (or related fields). Can be replaced with relevant work experience.
