As a Senior UX Designer at 10up, youâ€™ll be able to utilize a full spectrum of user experience design skills, while working collaboratively alongside our Content Design and Visual Design teams, leading meaningful, enterprise-level digital projects.

Youâ€™ll have the creative flexibility to explore and experiment across design tools and processes on a combination of unique, challenging projects and ongoing support engagements. As a leading digital agency, 10upâ€™s client roster spans from innovative startups and impactful non-profits, to some of the biggest names in the industry, such as ESPN, Google, The New York Times Co., Microsoft, and The Nobel Prize Committee.

As a 10upper, you have options for flexible and alternative work schedules. Intentionally remote since day one, spanning six continents and 40 countries, 10up fully embraces the benefits of distributed work.

### What you will do:

  * Provide senior-level UX guidance and design across 2-4 projects at a time - including workshops, user research, personas, user testing, wireframes, user flows, and other representations of UX design direction to guide clients through design processes.
  * Work to be part of a team that builds long-term, and highly productive working relationships across disciplines at 10up and with our clients.
  * Co-create and assist with communicating UX Design project plans that account for project constraints and client preferences.
  * Recognize and raise UX Design opportunities with existing and/or new clients with support of account development team members.

### About you:

  * You have 3+ years experience working in a fast-paced, digital agency environment across multiple work groups and with multiple concurrent projects across user experience design.
  * You are at your best when you are providing senior-level guidance on UX design deliverables that achieve the best possible project outcomes given a set of budget, timeline, and client constraints.
  * You have a strong understanding of web interactions: patterns, best practices, and common challenges website developers face; and experience driving strategic solutions to those challenges
  * You've worked with large-scale, CMS-driven website projects using block-based editors (e.g. Gutenberg for Wordpress).
  * You understand content strategy, publishing workflows, and content management platforms.
  * You love working in a highly collaborative environment and have experience working effectively in cross-discipline teams, helping others do their best work and showing them how you do your best work.

### Benefits of interest:

  * Multiple paid time off programs, including accrued PTO, parental leave, bereavement leave, and company holidays â€“ including an all-company break from Christmas Eve to New Years Day.
  * Health, dental, and life insurance programs (available for United States team members).
  * Retirement contribution programs (currently available in the U.S. and U.K.).
  * Flexible and alternate schedule programs - including options for 4-day work week (Monday-Thursday) configurations.
  * $3,000 USD accrued annually in professional development budget for you to spend on conferences, training, or to buy back time for programs like independent study.
  * Global Company summits â€“ opportunities to meet, socialize and learn with fellow 10uppers in person at remarkable destinations. 
  * An end-of-year all-hands bonus program, along with smaller opportunities for recognition throughout the year.
