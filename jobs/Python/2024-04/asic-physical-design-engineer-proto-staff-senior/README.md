### Company Description

 **Block is one company built from many blocks, all united by the same purpose of economic empowerment. The blocks that form our foundational teams â€” People, Finance, Counsel, Hardware, Information Security, Platform Infrastructure Engineering, and more â€” provide support and guidance at the corporate level. They work across business groups and around the globe, spanning time zones and disciplines to develop inclusive People policies, forecast finances, give legal counsel, safeguard systems, nurture new initiatives, and more. Every challenge creates possibilities, and we need different perspectives to see them all. Bring yours to Block.**

 **We are on a mission to build platforms, protocols and products that enable developers â€” from startups to established financial institutions â€” to more easily create solutions in the decentralized financial space that further our mission of economic empowerment globally. You will play a key role building towards that mission.**  

**Team Overview**

We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. We believe bitcoin plays an essential role in the future of payments and the worldâ€™s economy. We believe that the status quo of bitcoin mining does not serve the mission of the bitcoin ecosystem. So weâ€™re building a bitcoin mining rig powered by a Block designed ASIC. With our mining rig, we can address many issues such as the concentration of hardware supply in certain countries and incompatibility with clean energy sources.
