**Software Engineer - Data Engineering**

Rockerbox empowers marketing executives to confidently make data-driven decisions, helping brands such as Tula, Figs, and Burton with the strategic decision-making that drives growth. Our guiding principle is that no marketing organization should require a data engineering team to make data-driven decisions. We take on the technical challenges of collecting and consolidating all marketing data into a single platform to enable any marketing organization, big or small, to focus on their core strength: building their brand.

At Rockerbox, the Core Data team is pivotal, managing everything from live data collection and aggregation to data warehousing, including governance. As a Software Engineer, you will play a crucial leadership role within our technical organization, focusing on optimizing data storage, access patterns for efficiency and safety, and guiding data warehouse strategies.

The ideal candidate will bring profound expertise in data warehouses like Redshift and Snowflake, alongside a solid grasp of alternative data storage solutions (e.g., data lakes, NoSQL databases). Your experience should also include crafting data pipelines and a hands-on familiarity with technologies for event processing, pub/sub models, and orchestration tools such as Airflow.

We seek a Software Engineer passionate about contributing to a team-focused, dynamic environment, eager to influence our product's evolution as we expand our reach to thousands of customers.
