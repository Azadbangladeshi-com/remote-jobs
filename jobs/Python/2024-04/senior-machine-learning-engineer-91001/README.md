# [Senior Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-machine-learning-engineer-91001)  
### Moonvalley AI  
#### `ðŸ’° USD 55000.0~75000.0` `ðŸŒŽ India`  

We are building the worldâ€™s most capable foundational models, allowing anyone to generate beautiful, cinematic and high-definition video in minutes.

Weâ€™re a small team of young & hungry researchers, and have raised over $30m from world class investors including Khosla Ventures & YCombinator. We released our first model two months ago, quickly becoming the fastest growing AI product on Discord since Midjourney with over 100,000 users in 6 weeks.

Weâ€™re looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer and the role is fully remote (preference will be given to India based candidates). Candidates outside these regions may apply but you will be required to relocate (we will offer a relocation package).

**This role will require the candidate to time shift** and work from 12pm to 8pm IST to overlap with our North American team. You will have some flexibility here but in general we aim for 3 - 4 hours of crossover with our North American EST based team.

At Moonvalley, our product development process will be a bit non-standard and consist of small autonomous teams working to ship great features and experiences. Here is a good primer. Youâ€™ll work closely with your team (product designer, developers) daily, take ownership, make calls, and see things through without a lot of oversight.

### What you'll do (responsibilities)

Here are some examples of projects you might work on as a Sr Machine Learning Engineer at our company:

  * Work closely with academic advisors to incorporate cutting-edge research into our product.

  * Contribute to R&D projects aimed at developing computer vision models.

  * Keeping up to date with the latest advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence to continuously improve our products.

  * Collaborating with cross-functional teams to define, design, and implement machine learning models and pipelines.

  * Conducting experiments, analyzing results, and iterating on models to optimize performance.

  * Participate in swift iteration cycles related to Training/Fine-Tuning, testing and deployment of models.

  * Experiment, validate, and iterate on machine learning models specific to video and image processing.

  * Communicating clearly and effectively with cross-functional teams to understand requirements and provide technical guidance.

### What we're looking for (qualifications)

The ideal candidate for this role should possess:

  * MS/PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering or a related field with a focus on computer vision.

  * Proven research experience in computer vision and familiarity with academic conferences (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS).

  * Exceptionally strong Python skills - Minimum 5 years of experience.

  * Knowledge of CNN, RNN/LSTM/GRU, and Transformer models.

  * Rapid prototyping using open-source algorithms and shaping them to meet product needs.

  * Experience deploying ML models in the Cloud.

  * Prior experience with AWS and related services.

  * Experience with databases (Postgres/MySQL).

  * ### ML framework: Pytorch / Tensorflow.

  * Experience with experiment tracking systems.

  *  **Bonus:** Contributions to open-source projects in computer vision.

### What we offer (compensation & benefits)

  * ### Competitive salary and equity.

  * ### Health coverage.

  * ### Unlimited paid vacation.

  * Fully-distributed culture thatâ€™s async first.

  * ### Hardware setup.

In our team, we approach our work with the dedication similar to Olympic athletes. Anticipate occasional late nights and weekends dedicated to our mission. We understand this level of commitment may not suit everyone, and we openly communicate this expectation.

If you're motivated by deeply technical problems, a seemingly never-ending uphill battle and the opportunity to build (and own) a generational technology company, we can give you what you're looking for.

This is a fully remote position with Moonvalley, and we welcome candidates from anywhere. We meet a few times every quarter, usually in a center-point between NA and India (like Dubai).

If you're excited about the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI technology and help shape the future of sales, we encourage you to apply. We look forward to hearing from you!
