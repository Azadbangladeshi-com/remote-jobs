### Qventus  
#### `ðŸŒŽ India`  

### **About Us:**

Qventus is a real-time decision-making platform for hospital operations. Our mission is to simplify how healthcare operates so that hospitals and caregivers can focus on delivering the best possible care to patients. We use artificial intelligence and machine learning to create products that help nurses, doctors, and hospital staff anticipate issues and make operational decisions proactively.

###  **About the Role:**

Weâ€™re looking for a Data Analyst to join our Product Analytics team. You will use your skills in SQL and data visualization to help build and maintain impactful analytics products for both our clients and internal teams.

Youâ€™ll work closely with our product, design, and engineering teams to illuminate both the operational opportunities in our client hospitals as well as the entire impact chain of our product. By building a deep understanding of what Qventus does and how it improves the delivery of healthcare for our customers, youâ€™ll evaluate the best ways to measure and visualize the performance of our companyâ€™s tools and algorithms.

The most important thing to the role will be your ability to balance speed with reliability. It will require your:

  * Strong SQL skills and comfort working with complex, interrelated datasets

  * Familiarity with visualization tools. We use Looker, but experience with Tableau, PowerBI, R Shiny, MatPlotLib, or any other similar tool or library is sufficient.

  * Ability to trace data anomalies from dashboards back to the precipitating log events

  * Constant curiosity about the problems to be solved (not just the technical execution)

### **Key Responsibilities:**

  * Support repeatable analyses that drive insights into how our products are being used and how they affect our healthcare customersâ€™ goals

  * Deliver ad-hoc analyses to support our Delivery team and client satisfaction

  * Support our analytics products, including troubleshooting queries, supporting dashboard rollouts to new clients, and developing new analytic features

  * Contribute to the health of our analytics platform (e.g. deployments and documentation)

### **What Weâ€™re Looking For:**

  * 3+ years experience in a data-centric role (analytics, science, engineering)

  * Significant experience leveraging SQL to answer applied business analytics questions

  * Some experience using modern data visualization tools (Looker preferred)

  * A love for the big picture and a healthy obsession with the details

  * Deep curiosity and a passion for real-world impact

  * High proficiency in spoken and written English

### **Itâ€™s a Plus if You Haveâ€¦**

  * Experience with US Healthcare data: EHRs and/or claims

  * ### Experience with dbt

  * Experience with data modeling and proper schema design

  * Working, hands on, knowledge of modern data warehouses (Snowflake preferred) 

  * Experience with Looker and comfort with LookML

  * Advanced degree in statistics, economics, or other quantitative field

Qventus is on a mission to take modern technologies and principles that have been proven in other industries â€” artificial intelligence, machine learning, behavioral science, and data science â€” and apply them to simplify healthcare operations. At Qventus, you will have the opportunity to work with an exceptional, mission-driven team, and the ability to impact the lives of patients directly. Weâ€™re inspired to work with healthcare leaders on our founding vision and unlock world-class medicine through world-class operations.

We believe that diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are fundamental to improving healthcare and society, and thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building a company that leads the way.
