# [Senior Software Engineer, Low-Latency Systems](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-low-latency-systems-53440)  
### Monad Labs  
#### `ðŸ’° 400000.0`  

Founded by Jump Trading alums, Monad Labs is a tech startup using low-latency programming, compiler optimization, and multithreaded computing to build an ultra-high-performance smart contract platform. The work entails building an optimal stack-based VM that supports multithreaded computation, as well as developing and implementing an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm enabling a network of nodes to come to consensus.

### The Role

Monad Labs is looking for strong software engineers who enjoy solving challenging performance engineering and low-level optimizations problems. Candidates with experience developing systems with lean memory and compute limits are an ideal match. You will be part of a small, deeply technical team, working on high-impact problems in a fast-paced environment. Although we are building a new blockchain, previous experience with crypto is not expected.

### Who you are

  * Resourceful and self-motivated
  * Team oriented, collaborative, and a good communicator
  * Adaptive; able to make meaningful contributions in a fast-paced environment
  * Opinionated about software architecture
  * Motivated to push the limits of system performance through repeated optimization
  * Interested in building high-value fault-tolerant distributed systems

### What youâ€™ve done

  * Years of C++ development experience
  * HFT or embedded systems development, such as writing software for packet processing, communication, codecs, robotics, etc.
  * Excellent instincts for software architecture
  * Knowledge of performance optimization/profiling tools
  * Knowledge of proper memory management
  * Knowledge of unix, shell scripting, and python
  * Ideal but not required: Bachelors in technical field; 5 yearsâ€™ experience

### What youâ€™ll be doing

  * Optimizing a high-performance multithreaded stack-based VM, as well as ancillary functionality (disk I/O, computation metering, network)
  * Identifying bottlenecks through profiling, and evaluate design choices for accelerating computation flow
  * Designing and implementing architecture improvements
  * Contributing to developer tooling
  * Tech stack: C++, clang, LLVM, gdb, perf, unix, git

### Why work with us

  * Work on extremely challenging problems with massive potential impact
  * Competitive salary, along with equity
  * Mental wellness and fitness stipend
  * Shape the culture as an early employee and make impactful contributions from day one
  * Flat organization

### Salary and benefits

Minimum full-time salary of $200,000. (**This is not a guarantee of compensation or salary; a final offer amount may vary based on factors including but not limited to experience, domain expertise, and geographic location.)

Monad Labsâ€™ benefits include unlimited and encouraged paid time off; insurance coverage; home office equipment stipend; monthly wellness/fitness stipend; and 10 company-observed holidays.
