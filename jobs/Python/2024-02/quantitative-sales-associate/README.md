# [Quantitative Sales Associate](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/quantitative-sales-associate)  
### Databento  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

The financial industry is growing at a record pace, but our data providers are still stuck in the past â€” with cumbersome onboarding processes, complicated APIs, slow infrastructure, and expensive licensing costs.

Databento is the next-generation market data provider â€” with the radical idea that you should only pay for the data that you use. We power the world's largest finance and fintech institutions _and_ lower the barrier of entry for small startups.

Since starting in 2019, we've raised over $27.8M in funding and have over 2,000 companies signed up pre-launch. Our team consists of former data users from firms like Two Sigma, Belvedere, Pico, Bloomberg, Pinterest, and Google.

We offer health, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as 401(k) matching and visa sponsorships. We accommodate 100% remote work, with teammates living around the globe and paid in their local currency.

### Responsibilities

As a quantitative sales associate you will oversee the full scope of sales at Databento. This includes the following:

  * Own the technical sales process, from answering technical customer inquiries and providing data samples, to solving data-related issues that our customers raise. 
  * Create common examples and use-cases with market data, with examples in Python, C++, and/or Rust. 
  * Gather customer feedback, testimonials, case studies, and more. 
  * Establish and maintain accurate, timely, and documented forecasting and record-keeping procedures, keeping our CRM up-to-date and organized.
  * Build a network of executive relationships across the industry and with key partners and customers.
  * Stay up-to-date with industry trends, market dynamics, and competitor activities to identify potential business opportunities and adapt sales strategies accordingly.
  * Collaborate across teams to align sales efforts with overall company objectives and ensure a seamless customer experience.

### Desired Qualifications

The ideal candidate has experienced the end-to-end sales pipeline, including top-of-funnel, upselling, channel sales, customer success, and forecasting. Below are other skills that we look for:

  * Understand and communicate with our user base of developers and quants.
  * Experience with quant trading and market microstructure.
  * Extreme attention to detail and record-keeping, as well as the ability to automate processes in Hubspot.
  * Professional communication skills that align with the tone of an institutional financial product.
  * White-glove management of the sales cycle with continual buy-in from the customer, discovering the user's pain points, signs of friction, being honest when our product isn't the best fit, not being too pushy or salesy, and knowing when to continue vs. back off.
  * Readiness to work within a startup environment with limited resources and personnel. 
  * As a bonus: Active usage of Github, knowledge of enough C++, Python, and/or Rust to help answer client inquiries.
