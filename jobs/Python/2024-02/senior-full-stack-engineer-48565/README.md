What we do

We are an exciting early-stage AI start-up creating the future of manufacturing! We believe that blue-collar workers are an essential part of this transformation. We are dedicated to empowering these workers by assisting them in their daily tasks and unlocking the full potential of manual labor through productivity and flexibility.  
  
We are utilizing cutting-edge technology, such as computer vision and artificial intelligence, to revolutionize manufacturing by providing workers with the tools they need to improve their productivity beyond current limitations. Our focus is initially on assembly processes, but we plan to expand to other areas, including material consignment and machine repair activities. By improving efficiency, we aim to make products more affordable and use resources more sustainably.  
  
Our team is led by experienced entrepreneurs Max and Silviu. Max has previously founded a company in manufacturing that digitized 40 factories, and Silviu holds a PhD in computer science and is a computer vision expert. He has previously led a team that developed a robot taxi service at Volkswagen and built a startup in the security industry. Our team includes members from top-tier universities such as ETH and MIT, as well as individuals with entrepreneurial experience in the fashion industry and at leading research institutions like Fraunhofer.  
  
At our company, we value hard work, creativity, and a willingness to learn and grow. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome candidates of all backgrounds. Additionally, we offer a comprehensive benefits package that includes medical insurance and a learning and development budget.

Your role

**Senior Full-Stack Engineer**  
  
This is a remote role, allowing you to work from anywhere within Europe while ensuring that we still donâ€™t lose the personal touch through frequent personal encounters in Berlin.

You will be one of the first engineers and will have the opportunity to apply artificial intelligence to the manufacturing industry. As an early engineer, youâ€™ll be a core part of our product.

You will not be bound by legacy technologies and slow processes. As our venture grows, you will also grow and have an opportunity to expand our engineering team and create an engineering culture. This role is for entrepreneurial-minded engineers who want to be an early part of a fast-growing startup. Our fast-growing nature also means you will receive increasingly more responsibilities.
