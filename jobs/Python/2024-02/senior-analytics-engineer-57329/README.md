### Job Description

### About **the Job/What will you do?**

At Hiflylabs, we are looking to extend our Analytics Engineering team. This team typically works with international clients in small squads, almost exclusively in agile.

 **We expect you to be a Analytics Engineer at heart: a data-oriented person with data/software engineering chops.**

You will be briefed on what the client wants on the business side (itâ€™s in plain English and not overly complex).

You then pick the technical components needed to fulfill those needs, mostly out of cloud services we routinely work with. Some of these are standard AWS or GCP platform services, some are even more modern ones, like Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, or Looker. You help to scope the sprints as well.

Sprint-by-sprint you take part in delivering a reliable, working solution that pleases the client and meets the business constraints as well.

Finally we celebrate with you, and help you move on to the next challenge that advances your personal and professional development.

You report to the CTO (who is managing the Analytics Engineering team). You usually touch bases a couple times per week â€“ but you are expected to be self-sufficient, and you will not be micro-managed for sure.

### Tasks

  * Design and implement Data Pipelines with platform services and serverless solutions
  * Develop, and test ingestion pipelines from various sources
  * Create data transformations with SQL, Python, PaaS and 3rd party tools (e.g. dbt)
  * Automate data ingestion and transformation (often with Airflow or similar tools)

### Qualifications

### Requirements

  * Data transformation background: sound conceptual understanding and practical experience of data modeling and ETL processing, including extensive knowledge of SQL. As an orientation, you are likely to have 4+ intensive years in the field.
  * Intermediate software development background, preferably in Python and/or focused on data transformation.
  * At least some experience in cloud data management, preferably in AWS or GCP data stack components (primarily batch data management, storage, loading, transformation of structured data structures, Data Lake storage and management tools)
  * Strong technical and business English (oral, reading and writing)

### Personal Traits

  * Team player, ability to lead the team and work with others
  * Willing to own the project delivery
  * Proactive in finding solutions
  * Eager to learn and improve
