About Snowplow:  
As the leader in Data Creation, Snowplow empowers more than 10,000 organisations, including Strava, Burberry, Condé Nast and Flickr to create first-party customer behavioral data to unlock transformative AI and advanced analytics directly from their warehouse, lakehouse or in a real-time stream.  
Snowplow was founded with the belief that data teams should spend their time innovating and driving competitive advantage, not extracting and wrangling behavioral data from CDP’s or digital analytics platforms.  
Following our $40 million in Series B funding led by global venture capital firm, NEA, whose prior investments include Databricks, MongoDB, and Elastic, we are on the lookout for more creative and innovative individuals to help us shape our next chapter.  
The Opportunity:  
We are looking for an Analytics Engineer (sometimes called a BI Engineer or Data Analyst) to join our Engineering team. The team you will be joining is focused on the technologies that our customers and community use to collect data (our trackers and webhook integrations) and prepare it for their various use cases (our SQL data models) and integration into our emerging suite of first-class Data Applications.  
You will be joining a wider team of 30+ remote engineers who work closely with our product, support, and customer teams. There is a huge opportunity to learn more about all aspects of engineering and data, from code to customers.

● Developing and maintaining a suite of production SQL data models used by our customer base and the community. Primarily focusing on dbt for packaging and execution.● Building out our offering around data modeling.

With the help of Python and different frameworks like Streamlit you will be building data apps that will leverage data models to directly impact our customers' experience.● Supporting our prospect/customer facing teams by showcasing the possibilities with Snowplow data, such as powering personalisation and recommendation systems, or developing advanced models (marketing attribution, lifetime value, etc.). ● Being an active part in decision making on what we
build to help our customers get more value out of Snowplow, and how we deliver it. You’ll bring a different perspective and we’ll want your input! ● Responsible for developing and productizing data models and data apps, focusing on scalability, performance and maintainability, and developing in-depth understanding of cloud data warehouses and common web and mobile analytics use cases. This is an area of growing focus at Snowplow; you will have the opportunity to work alongside our Product team on defining how our data modeling offering will evolve over time.  
We’d love to hear from you if:  
● SQL and DBT are your thing. You have expertise in SQL, including manipulation of large data sets, performance tuning, etc ● You’re familiar with cloud technologies. You have experience working with data in a cloud data warehouse (Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks, or BigQuery)● Experience with a modern data modeling technology (DBT) and BI tool (Looker, Tableau, etc.) would be a plus● You are not new to engineering.

Some experience with technical content writing would be a plus● You are excited to work autonomously.
