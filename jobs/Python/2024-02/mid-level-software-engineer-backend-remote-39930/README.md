At New Relic, we provide our customers real-time insights, so they can innovate faster. Our software delivers insightful observability tools across different technologies and distributed systems, enabling software engineering teams to quickly identify, understand and tackle issues, analyze performance and get the most of their software and infrastructure.

We work with data at a scale found at few companies using a diverse tech stack (Go, Java, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Kubernetes, many public cloud web services, and more). At New Relic, you will work with some of the best engineers and seek some of the most complex problems in the industry.

If you love scale and want to contribute to one of the largest and fastest growing observability platforms in the market, we want to hear from you: We're looking for mid-senior level software engineers to join our teams within the Product organization.

This role requires

  * 2+ years of hands-on professional experience with distributed systems, concurrency, and scaling in a production environment.
  * Strong experience in writing software in Java or other object oriented languages (C++, Python, etc) and you are not afraid of adapting, learning and working with different languages and frameworks.
  * Being comfortable in a fast-paced environment focused on delivering production code at a regular cadence using Agile techniques, tools and methodologies.
  * Having a collaborative work style that includes colleagues in important decisions and leads to shared code ownership
