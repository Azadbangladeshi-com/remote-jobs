 **Optional Application Task**

 **Question 1**

Imagine the following query being issued against a distributed analytics engine, such as Google Big Query or Redshift.

    
    
    SELECT sale_date, SUM(TotalAmount) / COUNT(DISTINCT salesperson_id) AS SalesPerPerson
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY sale_date
    

[sales] table has one row for each product item sale transaction.

What part of the query would cause the most data movement between the compute nodes?

How would you optimize the query or data model to answer the same question with less data movement between compute nodes without loss of precision?

 **Question 2**

Given the following Entity Relationship diagram describing a generic Shop selling products, please write a SQL query that answers the following question:

‚ÄúWhich two Shops have the highest and the lowest productivity respectively in the last 28 days?‚Äù

Shop productivity is measured by monetary value of sales divided by total salesperson work-hours in the same time period.
