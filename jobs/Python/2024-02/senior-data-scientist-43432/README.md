 **JOB TITLE: Senior Data Scientist** **  
** **LOCATION:** _REMOTE_

_  
_**THE ROLE:** ** __**

We are looking for a driven and creative Sr. Data Scientist to work in an analytics-focused role supporting product development for our Creator Tools. In this role, you will define metrics that track engagement and user-centric outcomes within our suite of innovative creative tools for music-makers. You will sit squarely between the realms of deep creativity and analytical rigor, drawing connections between the creative workflows of musicians and the metrics necessary rigorously and accurately measure their success. Working in close partnership with Product, Design, and User Research, you will use analytics to discover new patterns of user behavior and leverage these discoveries to build more relevant and impactful experiences for our users.

All of this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that the necessary data is accessible and easy to use; aiding in the design of Product roadmaps and experimentation plans to support our products; and developing algorithms that drive in-product experiencesâ€”e.g., personalization.

**WHAT YOUâ€™LL DO:**

_Data manipulation_

We expect our Data Scientists to have expert analytical SQL skills. This means fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so _this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries_.

_Analysis_

Nearly every problem starts with models that can be interpreted to drive action. Weâ€™re seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysisâ€”someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful suggestions. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.

_Modeling_

You should have hands-on experience building machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised) and know how to incorporate your models into production workflows and product experiences.

**JOB REQUIREMENTS:**

  * Regular usage of a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (ideally Python).
  * Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, AWS Athena, or similar).
  * Hands-on experience with self-service product-analytics tools ( _e.g._ , Looker, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap).
  * Training in statistics, econometrics, or machine learning, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.
  * Exposure to a variety of data sets used by Product teams. Chiefly, large-scale event data ( _e.g._ , Mixpanel, Segment, Snowplow, server logs) and normalized transactional databases ( _e.g._ , e-commerce and subscription datasets).
  * Exposure to large-scale model training in a platform like Spark is helpful but not required.

**NICE TO HAVES:**

There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, weâ€™ll flesh out what youâ€™ve built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.

As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset. If this topic is new to you, thatâ€™s okayâ€”you should be open to learning about it.

The national pay range for this role is $150,000 - $175,000. Individual compensation will be commensurate with the candidate's experience.
