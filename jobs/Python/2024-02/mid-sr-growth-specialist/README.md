# [Mid/Sr Growth Specialist](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/mid-sr-growth-specialist)  
### Zipdev  
#### `üåé Argentina`  

Zipdev is looking for a Growth Specialist to join our team. Our client is small but brilliant team, looking to add one more. Company management is closely involved and ensures that our tight development team handles only the most vital and strategic development projects.

Do you have a ‚Äúgrowth hacking‚Äù mindset? Do you like the idea of rigorously testing marketing, promotional, advertising, content and other ideas using cold, hard metrics - so you and everyone else too can learn what‚Äôs really working and what isn‚Äôt?

Do you like the idea of helping a startup in the Amazon advertising space grow into something awesome through a systematic process of carefully testing ideas to find the best ways to grow?

The more experience you have as a ‚Äúgrowth hacker‚Äù or ‚Äúgrowth marketer‚Äù, the better. But we also realize that the right mindset and being willing and able to just dive in and solve problems related to growth is a huge asset and can be more important than the number of years spent on the job.

If you think you have what it takes, and can come up with awesome ideas for acquiring, activating and retaining customers, and systematically help set up, organize and run tests for these ideas, find the winning ones based on specific actionable metrics, not opinions - if this is you, we should talk.
