# Senior DevOps Engineer

REMOTE - USA

  
FreeWill is an award-winning, social-good startup that has partnered with **1450+** nonprofits who support our mission while raising more than $9B in bequests to charities since we were founded in 2017. We‚Äôve been featured in the New York Times, Forbes, Oprah‚Äôs magazine, and our co-CEOs have even been named to Town & Country‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop 50 Philanthropists‚Äù list.  
  

  
All of this is because we‚Äôve figured out how to make some powerful (but complicated!) ways to donate much easier and more accessible. Our products make things easier for the donors who want to change the world and for nonprofits doing heroic work around the planet.  
  

  
In the last 6 years, we‚Äôve grown from 5 people to 175+ (all smart, tenacious, and kind), and continue to grow. We‚Äôd love to have you be a part of this adventure. Check us out on Glassdoor!

About the role  
**  

  
We are looking for a compassionate and experienced DevOps engineer who wants to make an impact at a mission-driven company. You are excited to work with a low-ego, highly collaborative team and take on a high level of responsibility across many projects. You solve problems through continual experimentation, risk-taking, and learning from experience.  
  

  
FreeWill has set compensation and a non-negotiation policy for fairness reasons (we don't think that an individual's pay should be determined by how comfortable they are negotiating). As a result, we like to be transparent and up front about the compensation. When we make an offer, we provide multiple options so that employees can choose between compensation packages that prioritize salary or stock options. The offers for this role will be between $160,000 and $170,000.  
  

  
This role reports to our Platform Engineering Manager, Katrina Walker.
