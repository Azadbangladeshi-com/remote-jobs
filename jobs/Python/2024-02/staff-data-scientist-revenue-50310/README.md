# [Staff Data Scientist - Revenue](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/staff-data-scientist-revenue-50310)  
### Shopify  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### Company Description

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. Since 2006, weâ€™ve grown to over 10,000 employees and generated over $496 billion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts peopleâ€™s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.  
  
Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, ambiguityâ€”and a little bit of chaos. We thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

### Before you apply, consider if you:

  * Care deeply about what you do
  * Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
  * Are resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
  * Bring critical thought and opinion
  * Embrace differences and disagreement to get s**t done and move forward
  * Work digital-first for your daily work

### Job Description

In the dynamic world of e-commerce, the role of a Data Scientist in our Revenue organization is pivotal. As a Tech Lead, you'll be at the forefront of Shopify's growth, driving our mission to not only bring new merchants onto our platform but also to connect existing merchants with new products and features, fueling their business growth. This role demands a blend of technical expertise, leadership skills, and a knack for unlocking the potential of data to propel our commercial efforts.

### Key Responsibilities

  * Leadership in Data Science: Lead and mentor a team of data scientists, overseeing their technical work and ensuring alignment with our commercial and revenue goals.
  * Revenue-Driven Data Science: Focus on uplift modeling, experimentation, machine learning (including propensity models), and attribution to identify and test growth levers. Your work will directly impact our ability to attract new merchants and expand our relationship with existing ones.
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with Operations, Engineering, Analytics, and Leadership teams to integrate data science into the core of our revenue strategies.
  * Innovation in Data Products: Lead the development of internal products that leverage advanced AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they are tailored to support our Sales, Merchant Success (Account Management), Partner, and Marketing efforts.
  * Strategic Communication: Translate complex technical concepts into understandable insights for non-technical audiences, including senior and executive leadership, to facilitate data-informed decision-making.
  * Technical Mastery: Showcase extensive experience in Python, including a strong grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), advanced SQL techniques, data modeling, and Business Intelligence platforms and tools. Experience on the Google Cloud Platform is a plus. 

### Qualifications

  * Proven experience as a Technical Lead in a data science team, guiding the technical work of individual contributors.
  * Demonstrable expertise in deploying scalable data products, with a particular focus on revenue and commercial applications.
  * Masterful ability in data storytelling, strategic thinking, and fostering a data-driven culture within the team.
  * Experience with productionized machine learning models at scale is highly desirable.
  * Extensive domain experience in e-commerce, sales & marketing, and/or SaaS is advantageous.
