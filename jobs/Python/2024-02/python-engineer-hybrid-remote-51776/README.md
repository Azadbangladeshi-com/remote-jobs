# [Python Engineer - Hybrid Remote](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/python-engineer-hybrid-remote-51776)  
### Kunai  
#### `ðŸ’° 315000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Kunai is a fast-growing digital consultancy focused on banking, payments, and fintech powered by a global network that attracts the best and brightest people from all backgrounds and cultures, driven by innovation and experimentation, spread across almost every single continent. Over the past decade, we've shipped over 150 products for clients that include Visa, American Express, Capital One, WEX, Wells Fargo, Ernst & Young, and TOMS Shoes. Our founders built a previous agency (Monsoon) that was acquired by Capital One in 2015.

We are seeking a prolific backend engineer who has built production-ready products in serverless environments, enjoys automating with Python, and celebrates a tight development environment in respects to AWS, CICD, and Test Driven Development. This small team will be executing on a list of requirements for a streaming platform that will orchestrate multiple API calls at scale and publishing new stream events. The day-to-day will also involve writing Lambda functions in AWS and solutions architecting. This is a great opportunity to work cross-functionally with users that are not developers, transferring your knowledge of TDD to Behavior Driven Development, and thinking in the language of business rather than the language of code.

 **Hybrid remote, 3 days/week on-prem in either Richmond, McLean, VA, or Manhattan.**

### Requirements:

  * 5 yrs of Python in a production environment
  * 2 yrs Go, Java, or Typescript
  * AWS services: Lambda, SQS, S3
  * DynamoDB, MongoDB, or other NoSQL
  * unit testing and integration testing, preferably in a TDD environment

### Nice to haves:

  * automated testing frameworks
  * experience with Behavioral Driven Development
  * AWS solutions architect certification

Salary range is 145 - 170k, depending on YOE, with a competitive benefits package. A higher range will be considered for residents of NYC.

At Kunai, we have built deep relationships with our clients. Our bar is high, and our mission is to always exceed our clientâ€™s expectations. If you are fanatical about customer success and driven to work on and solve tough technical challenges, we would love to chat with you!
