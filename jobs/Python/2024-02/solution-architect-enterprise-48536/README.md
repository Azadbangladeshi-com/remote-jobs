From Fivetranâ€™s founding until now, our mission has remained the same: to make access to data as simple and reliable as electricity. With Fivetran, customer data arrives in their warehouses, canonical and ready to query, with no engineering or maintenance required. Weâ€™re proud that more organizations continue to leverage our technology every day to become truly data-driven.

### About the Role

Fivetran is building data pipelines to power the modern data stack for thousands of companies.

Fivetran data replication connectors have been implemented across many of the world's largest enterprises.

Along the way, you will facilitate the optimisation of the implementation through performance tuning, offer best-practice advice on source and target setup & use your analytical skills to technically troubleshoot issues.
