### Block  
#### `ðŸ’° 419700.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### Company Description

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldnâ€™t work together.  
  
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions â€“ to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, weâ€™ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.  
  
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes â€“ large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. Weâ€™re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

### Job Description

Square Messages is a messaging platform for merchants to manage conversations with their customers across multiple channels (SMS, email, etc.). Situated within the Square ecosystem, Square Messages has integrations with various Square products that enrich messages with appointment bookings, receipts, invoices, coupons, marketing, and more.

Messages is also home to Square Assistant â€“ an AI-powered virtual assistant to help merchants serve their customers 24/7. Square Assistant responds to customers asking for help with their appointments, including cancellations, confirmations, and conversational rescheduling of appointments. For more nuanced customer requests, Square Assistant saves merchants time by utilizing an in-house large language model to suggest responses, as well as actions that integrate with the rest of the Square Ecosystem. In the year ahead, we plan to expand Square Assistantâ€™s capabilities in many ways, like personalizing responses for each merchant or deploying larger language models in production.

We are looking for senior AI engineers with interests in language modeling, conversational AI, and production machine learning at scale.

  * Work cross-functionally with other Square teams to enhance the Messages platform integrations.
  * Ship cutting-edge AI to businesses that traditionally havenâ€™t had access to it.

### Qualifications

### You haveâ€¦

  * 6+ years of experience with Machine Learning.
  * Experience with Large Language Models OR comparable Deep Learning experience.
  * Experience with PyTorch is strongly recommended.
  * Experience with Python. Openness to programming in Java.
  * A track record of designing and maintaining production-level machine learning systems.
  * A commitment to writing clean and maintainable code.
  * Interest in helping to shape the mission and roadmap of the team, and rallying others to join you.
