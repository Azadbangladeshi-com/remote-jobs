## **Who we are**

### **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### **About the team**

The Payments organization owns some of Stripeâ€™s most critical payment flows and a platform that processes hundreds of billions of dollars in payments a year. Our team builds and scales the infrastructure and financial partner integrations that enables Stripe to accept, manage, and payout money across many countries, currencies, and payment methods.

Our work is core to Stripeâ€™s business, and thousands of developers use our platform and infrastructure to create valuable products and services that billions of people use. Our goal is to increase the GDP of the internet by making it easy to build global products, services, and platforms that handle money.

Technical Operations roles in Payments are a dynamic and key component of Stripe's success. Focused on financial partner integrations and funds flow expansion, we sit at the intersection of product/platform engineers and financial partners, connecting them to ensure that everyone thrives and nothing is lost in translation.

## **What youâ€™ll do**

### **Responsibilities**

  * Build, maintain and scale tools for observability and interventions
  * Report generation and delivery to financial partners and merchants 
  * Introduce data and process efficiencies to meet the scale and speed of Stripe.
  * Interface with Stripeâ€™s financial partners across the world to drive alignment between their products and how Stripe uses them, and hold Stripeâ€™s partners accountable to resolve day-to-day operational breakages, often requiring detailed investigation and sometimes code changes
  * Scale our payments performance and risk recon operations by investing anomalous behavior, working with financial partnerships, etc.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * Have at least 5+ years experience of writing high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby and Java. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general coding skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework
  * Comfort using Python and SQL to navigate Stripe's data and diagnose the scope and urgency of issues
  * Have strong analytical skills to investigate, prioritize, and identify the root cause of issue
  * Have experience managing communications and workflows with technical and non-technical teams across internal and external stakeholders (including external financial partners and vendors)

These include (but aren't limited to): reading/writing code, reading documentation or partner specifications, running debugging programs, reading logs, asking well-formed questions to domain experts, or digging into the raw data through various interfaces
