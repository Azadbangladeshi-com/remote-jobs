### Job Description

We are looking for a Staff Engineer to join our Engineering Support Group and help our so-called Support Funnel and LiveOps teams to succeed. World-class customer service is one of the cornerstones of Wolt. Over the years we have invested a lot in our in-house built support tooling as we believe that it‚Äôs the only way we can ensure satisfaction for all of our customers and partners in each of the 25 countries in which we operate.

One of the primary features of the Support Funnel team is building a so-called ‚ÄúSupport Layer‚Äù, which is a no-code workflow engine that allows people from the operations and support department to build self-service customer flows using UI, without coding.

On the other side, the LiveOps Team owns the ‚ÄúSupport Inbox‚Äù. This is a platform that based on heuristics detects potential problems with orders even before those became obvious to a customer.

As a Staff Engineer at Wolt, you‚Äôd own your technological competence with a passion, sharing best practices, mentoring developers, and facilitating their expertise relentlessly. You‚Äôll make sure we scale while maintaining engineering quality and producing uncompromising results from the product vision.

A concrete challenge that will require your attention as a Staff engineer would be to help the LiveOps team to migrate Support Inbox to an event-driven architecture and optimize the persistence layer. Doing so will lay a foundation for years to come as well as allow us to deploy Support Inbox to new business verticals. Given that the system is operating on a large dataset and has demanding requirements on data consistency, that‚Äôs certainly a challenge that will require a holistic look and high engineering skills.

üìçThis role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland, Germany or Sweden.

### Qualifications

We are looking for someone with a professional background in building complex systems and who has strong experience with **Python or Node.js with Typescript**. A solid understanding of architectural skills, e.g.building distributed applications, will be needed to succeed in this role as well as the ability and interest to share that knowledge with other engineers. Ideally you have already mentored other engineers and facilitated knowledge sharing sessions before.  
  
Our services are up and running in AWS and we use k8s to run our operation workloads so previous experience with these pieces of technology would be a plus.

Aside from technology, we expect you to be a product-oriented problem solver, a good communicator, willing to share knowledge and collaborate with people in and outside of your own team, and keen to bring up issues in a constructive manner to the team and to Wolt at large.

### Additional Information

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.
