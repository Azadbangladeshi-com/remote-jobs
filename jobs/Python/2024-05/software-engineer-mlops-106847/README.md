### **Job Description**

*Hiring will be into all Renesas EMEA and APAC offices, either for hybrid work or remotely*

In this role, you will be part of the AI & Cloud Engineering (ACE) Division and MLOps team. We are developing a comprehensive AI strategy that delivers a highly flexible platform to explore new Deep Learning / Machine Learning model architectures, combined with auto-tuned high performance for production environments across a wide range of hardware architectures. The platform can improve performance, developer efficiency & deployment velocity of both AI training and inference.

As an MLOps team member, you will develop the best-in-class software toolchain for AI software & hardware to support internal and external customers, which serves as the backbone of all products in our division. You will work closely with AI engineers to build innovative software tools to power the entire AI development lifecycle from developing and analyzing AI models to testing and loading the models on the hardware. You will then integrate the tools into a software platform delivered to our customers. You will apply software development best practices to design features, improve performance and deliver software. You will gain valuable experience in developing commercial grade MLOps products and will help in driving next generation hardware software co-design for AI domain specific problems.

Our division’s mission is to use the latest AI and cloud technologies to develop the best AI inference for advanced driver safety engineers building self-driving vehicles and other high performance compute products. Renesas is the leading automotive electronics supplier globally, and this is a rare opportunity to deploy your AI software to the billions of devices we ship to customers every year. You will join our newly formed AI & Cloud Engineering organization of around 100 software engineers. Due to strong demand for our AI-related products we are planning to triple in size in the next three years, so there is lots of room for you to help us grow the team together while remaining small.
