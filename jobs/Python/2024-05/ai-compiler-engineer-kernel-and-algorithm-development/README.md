###  **Job Description**

We are seeking a talented and motivated AI Kernel and Algorithm Engineer to join our team. In this role, you will be part of the AI & Cloud Engineering (ACE) Division and Hybrid Compiler team.

The team has been developing a comprehensive AI Compiler strategy that delivers a highly flexible platform to explore new DL/ML model architectures, combined with auto-tuned high performance for production environments across a wide range of hardware architectures. The compiler framework, ML graph optimizations and kernel authoring specific to the hardware impacts performance, developer efficiency & deployment velocity of both AI training and inference platforms. You will be developing AI compiler frameworks to accelerate machine learning workloads on the next generation of AI hardware. You will work closely with AI researchers to analyze deep learning models and how to lower them efficiently on AI platforms. You will also partner with hardware design teams to develop compiler optimizations for high performance. You will apply software development best practices to design features, optimization, and performance tuning techniques. You will gain valuable experience in developing machine
learning compiler frameworks and will help in driving next generation hardware software co-design for AI domain specific problems.

Our divisionâ€™s mission is to use the latest AI and cloud technologies to develop the best AI inference for advanced driver safety engineers building self-driving vehicles and other high performance compute products. Renesas is the leading automotive electronics supplier globally, and this is a rare opportunity to develop the infrastructure required to deploy our AI software to the billions of devices we ship to customers every year. You will join our newly formed AI & Cloud Engineering organization of around 100 software engineers. Due to strong demand for our AI-related products we are planning to triple in size in the next three years, so there is lots of room for you to help us grow the team together while remaining small. We are focusing on our hiring into our Tokyo, Beijing and Singapore sites. If you are successful and living outside of these cities, we can support your relocation to one of the three sites based on team needs.
