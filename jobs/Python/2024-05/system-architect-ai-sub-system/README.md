###  **Job Description**

Overview

We are seeking a talented and motivated System Architect (AI Sub-system) to join our R&D team to own, define, and drive exploration and design of our next generation AI sub-system involving multi heterogeneous devices in high performance computing (HPC) SoCs

Our divisionâ€™s mission is to use the latest AI and cloud technologies to develop the best AI inference for advanced driver safety engineers building self-driving vehicles and other high performance compute products. Renesas is the leading automotive electronics supplier globally, and this is a rare opportunity to develop the infrastructure required to deploy our AI software to the billions of devices we ship to customers every year. You will join our newly formed AI & Cloud Engineering organization of around 100 software engineers.
