### Locus Robotics  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Wilmington, MA`  

Locus Robotics is a leader in the rapidly growing eCommerce order fulfillment optimization space. Our solution helps warehouse owners attain 2-3X efficiency improvement over cart-picking operations, by empowering pickers to work collaboratively with our robots. All this is accomplished while integrating with the operatorâ€™s Warehouse Management System, utilizing and optimizing existing facility infrastructure.

Are you experienced in software development, robotics simulation, or game development? The Simulation Team is seeking a talented Senior Robotics Simulation Engineer to join our team to architect high-fidelity simulations that push the very limits of what's possible.

The Simulation Team pioneers the testing development process by creating intricate virtual environments for testing and refining robots. They design and construct simulations that accurately mirror real-world conditions and sensor data, leveraging simulation to streamline development, enhance safety, and ensure flawless robot performance across diverse environments and scenarios. In this role, you'll design, develop, and maintain robust simulations of large robot fleets navigating various environments and handling complex scenarios. Working closely with our Robotics Software Team, you'll integrate simulations throughout the development lifecycle, creating realistic simulations that mirror real-world robot behavior, sensor data, and environmental interactions.

This remote position can be based in US, Canada, or EMEA or hybrid in our Wilmington MA or Nashua NH offices.

**Responsibilities:**

  * Broaden custom simulators to support new robots, sensors, and behaviors.
  * Advance development creating Digital Twins between the real warehouse and simulated one.
  * Develop testing metrics for evaluation and tracking of simulation and robot performance.
  * Improve testing performance and efficiency to scale to large real-world type simulations.
  * Collaborate with other Robot Software teams to enable development of new cutting edge features.

**Qualifications:**

  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science or similar engineering degree. 
  * 5+ years of commercial experience working with C++ or other system languages.
  * 5+ years experience with creating simulations, games, or game engines (ideally Bevy).
  * 5 + years extensive experience with C++, Python, and Rust.
  * 5+ years experience with Entity-Component-System game engines.
  * Proficient English written and verbal communications skills required to collaborate effectively with internal and external teams.
  * Demonstrated ability to manage multiple, critical projects with shifting deadlines and requirements.
