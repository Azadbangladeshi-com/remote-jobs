As an engineering leader on the Experimentation Platform Team, you will have Reddit-wide impact supporting our mission to bring community, belonging, and empowerment to everyone in the world. We are excited about empowering innovation at Reddit through actionable and trustworthy experimentation at scale. If youâ€™re passionate about building products that change people's lives for the better, developing strategies for improving huge-scale products, building-testing-shipping in weeks (not months), and maintaining high-quality work-life balance, then Reddit will be the perfect home for you.

We are hiring a Staff Engineer, who will play a critical role in making Redditâ€™s experimentation platform world-class.

### Preferred Qualifications:

  * Technical leadership experience with a data analysis platform. Understanding of the basics of A/B testing, experimentation, feature rollout, and dynamic configuration.
  * Proficiency in back-end technologies, including Python and SQL.
  * Experience building or using A/B testing infrastructure as well as building analytics tools or data products.
