**About Tide**

At Tide, we are building a finance & admin platform designed to save small businesses time and money. We provide our members with business accounts and related banking services, but also a comprehensive set of connected administrative solutions from invoicing to accounting. Launched in 2017, Tide is now the leading business financial platform in the UK with 575,000 SME members (10% market share) and more than 250,000 SMEs in India. Headquartered in London, Tide has over 1,600 Tideans across the UK, Bulgaria, India, Serbia, Romania, Ukraine and Germany.

Tide is rapidly growing, expanding into new markets and always looking for passionate and driven people. Join us in our mission to empower small businesses and help them save time and money.

**About the Team:**

The Cloud Engineering team is designing and building the core infrastructure platform that supports Tideâ€™s global businesses, by evolving our new Kubernetes based deployment platform, rolling it out to our new markets and migrating our existing UK business to this new platform.

The Cloud Engineers work closely with our engineering teams to make sure our platform meets their needs and with our Information Security team to ensure we meet and exceed our regulatory obligations.

We are committed to a 100% Infrastructure-as-Code approach to infrastructure builds using Terraform and currently deploy to AWS. We also follow the GitOps model of application deployment and use tools such as ArgoCD, Helm and Crossplane to facilitate this approach. You will work closely with our Developer Experience team to make this model for deploying and managing services usable for our engineers.

**About the role:**

  * Working as part of a larger Cloud Engineering team, comprising Cloud Infrastructure (your team), Developer Experience, Cloud Operations and Cloud Data Engineering.
  * Working with stakeholders to understand the characteristics they require from our platform.
  * Writing Terraform and Helm charts to define our infrastructure and configure the middleware/shared services that support the platform.
  * Working collaboratively alongside other Senior Cloud Engineers to define and implement best practices.
  * Directly supporting engineers to understand what tools and access they need to effectively use the platform (and then working with Developer Experience to make sure those tools get built).
  * Helping to identify, research and implement new technologies that will improve the platform.
  * Promoting understanding of the capabilities of the platform throughout Tideâ€™s engineering department.
  * Mentoring and teaching (and being open to learning from your peers)

**What we are looking for:**

  * Having over 2 years of experience and most of that should be in a DevOps Engineering type role.
  * Having spent the majority of your career working in Cloud hosted environments.
  * You have hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Terraform and ideally a scripting language like Python.
  * Have a basic understanding of GitOps
  * Good understanding of the Kubernetes ecosystem 
  * Having a â€˜platformâ€™ mentality where you understand that weâ€™re building on behalf of our engineers who will rely on our services to build and innovate
  * Enjoy an environment where everyoneâ€™s ideas are heard and considered.
  * Happy to work in a highly regulated and security-conscious industry

**Our Tech Stack** _(You donâ€™t have to excel in all, but willing to learn them):_

  * AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Git and GitHub Actions, Python
