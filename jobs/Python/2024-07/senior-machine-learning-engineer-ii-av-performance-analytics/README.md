# Who are we

The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) software stack is a sophisticated workload that includes compute and data intensive functions within perception, prediction, planning and control. Maturity of the software not only depends on feature development but also meticulous and well defined analysis to provide feedback to feature engineering and testing teams. The Performance analytics is such a team bridging feature optimization and various testing platforms. Closely collaborating with Data science and Autonomy teams, we discover and define performance metrics enabling trend & insights for performance and reliability; we develop quantitative analysis and applications to facilitate development; and we continuously monitor on-road and testing status and derive release projection, feeding to leadership decisions.

In this role, youâ€™ll closely work with Data scientists, System Engineering and Autonomy teams to build up infrastructures to speed up various feature minings & learnings, build ML models to evaluate simulation performance across multiple platforms and continuously improve models for usability, scalability and adoption. You will have the opportunity of influencing how the test and data platform is designed, built and evaluated, work with product/project management defining the roadmap.

# What youâ€™ll be doing

  * Work on feature development for autonomous vehicle reliability dataset.

  * Collaborate with autonomy engineers to improve the quality and composition of our dataset.

  * Build machine learning models to scale up faulty segment and test cases management

  * Build end-to-end ML workflow, with usability, scalability adoption well taken into consideration

  * Resolving issues in a timely manner and providing support for customer teams

  * Work with project/product management for project planning and roadmap 

#

# What you must have

  * BA or Master in CS, EE or relevant software engineering field

  * Past delivery of end to end machine learning model powered applications

  * Proficient in python/sql/c++

  * Strong statistical learning background

  * Experience of data storage and management system(e.g SQL, Big Query, DBT, etc)

  * Experience of working in a cloud environment(e.g, AWS, GCP, etc) 

  * Knowledge and experience in at least one of perception, computational geometry, robotics path finding & motion planning, mapping.

# Bonus Points

  * Experience working with autonomous vehicle software ROS

  * Pytorch and GPU programing and training

  * Transfer learning through pre-trained modern deep learning network models.

 _The salary range for this po_ _sition is $161,200 - $237,000. Compensation will vary depending on location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. You m_ _ay also be offered a bonus, long-term incentives, and benefits. These ranges are subject to change._
