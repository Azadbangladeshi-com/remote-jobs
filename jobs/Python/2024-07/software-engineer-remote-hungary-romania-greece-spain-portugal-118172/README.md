What you'll do:

Arista today is one of the fastest-growing companies in the industry. Arista has disrupted the market with two significant innovations:

1\. Aristaâ€™s principle invention is an advanced network operating system, Arista EOSÂ® (Extensible Operating System). Based on open standards, delivering high reliability and unique programmability at all system levels and offering a data-driven network platform that automates IT workflows, provides network-wide visibility, and enables rapid problem resolution.

2\. Aristaâ€™s other key innovation is the exclusive use of best-in-class merchant silicon that enables open standards-based networking with rapid time-to-market. Notably, Aristaâ€™s merchant silicon strategy delivers state-of-the-art platforms at a faster time to market enabled by technology advances associated with Mooreâ€™s Law. In contrast, legacy approaches are built on custom ASICs coupled with monolithic software resulting in proprietary platforms and increased costs.

Aristaâ€™s engineering team started from a blank sheet of paper to architect an entirely new networking operating system. Aristaâ€™s unique architecture is based on three guiding principles:

1\. State orientation

2\. Open standards-based approach

3\. Single software image consistency
