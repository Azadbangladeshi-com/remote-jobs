Our focus is on improving both the local IDE and CI experience when working within our massive and modularized monorepo codebase. We're betting heavily on the future of Bazel. We've already made a 4x improvement on compilation speed and 2x improvement in CI turnaround, but there is still a lot more room for improvement. We do our work in the open, on GitHub, and progress can be seen in the bazel-ios project on GitHub.

  * Oversee the success of our team's projects, and achieve quantifiable results.

###  **Qualifications**

You have:

  * A passion for accelerating the development velocity of other engineers and improving their developer experience.
  * Experience leading projects that increase developer velocity.
  * Experience working with build and CI tools (Jenkins, BuildKite, fastlane, etc).
  * Excellent software engineering knowledge and the ability to provide technical mentorship and guidance.

Even better if you have experience with the following:

  * Bazel/Blaze/Buck build systems.
  * Reverse engineering Xcode, macOS, or iOS software.
  * iOS/Mac development languages (Swift, Objective-C) and tooling (xcodebuild, clang, swift, ld, actool, ibtool, and codesign).
