# [Director of Developer Relations ](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/director-of-developer-relations)  
### Airbyte  
#### `üí∞ $217,000 - $250,000` `üåé Remote`  

Airbyte is the open-source standard for EL(T). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt pre-built connectors to their needs.

So far, we've built over 350 connectors and have had 35,000+ companies replicating data with us. We've raised $181M from some of the world's top investors (Benchmark, Accel, Altimeter, Coatue, Y Combinator, etc.) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.
