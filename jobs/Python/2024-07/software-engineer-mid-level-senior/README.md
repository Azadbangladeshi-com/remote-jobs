The Person:

 _If you..._

  * love to program
  * enjoy building things and shipping them, truly making them work
  * find satisfaction in creating a really well-written piece of code
  * care about keeping the code maintainable and preserving its integrity
  * look for a better way, and strive to make it real
  * care about the business too
  * enjoy working with others who feel the same
  * learn how things work, just for fun or out of curiosity

... then this job is for you.
