The Simulation group delivers products that accelerate our autonomous vehicle development, testing, and deployment through specialized frameworks and tools. As a Senior Software Engineer on the Simulation Fidelity team, you will contribute to complex efforts aimed at identifying and addressing gaps within our simulation frameworks. These improvements are essential in facilitating our customers' ability to innovate and develop new AV features.

Your responsibilities will extend to building tools to evaluate and report on the fidelity of Cruiseâ€™s Simulation frameworks. You will be responsible for contributing to the full lifecycle of investigating and understanding our platforms: developing appropriate metrics and methodologies, building data pipelines to measure the accuracy and precision of different simulation frameworks, tracking the evolution of the AVs performance within Simulation, and deploying tools for clear and accurate reporting to stakeholders and customers.

This role requires an individual contributor with an entrepreneurial mindset and a willingness to take on a multifaceted role, embracing diverse responsibilities such as data analysis, software development, technical documentation writing, and more.

**What youâ€™ll be doing:**

  * Partner with stakeholders to define metrics which measure key performance indicators for simulation frameworks
  * Define and implement pipelines and tools which measure and continuously monitor metrics which evaluate simulated behaviors against real world observation data
  * Work closely with partner teams to enable rapid development and feedback, providing incremental value
  * Communicate progress and results clearly and concisely with leadership
  * Aid the organization in the identification and resolution of targeted areas for improvement
  * Maintain a high technical standard for code quality on the team, participating in architectural design and code reviews

**What you must have:**

  * 3+ years of experience writing Python in a production environment (unit testing, code review, algorithm performance and tradeoffs, etc.). Demonstrated experience with C++.
  * Familiarity with data analysis, e.g. statistics
  * Familiarity with SQL, ROS, numpy & scipy, Python bindings for C++, and plotting/visualization libraries
  * Excellent communication skills
  * BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, or Aerospace Engineering

**Bonus points!**

  * Experience building algorithms central to data analysis of engineering domains 
  * Experience developing software solutions that are used across engineering teams
  * Experience with computational geometry, linear algebra, or Machine Learning
  * Experience with time-series data analysis and online performance monitoring tools
  * Experience developing automation scripts (Python and Bash scripts)

The salary range for this position is $122,400 - $180,000. Compensation will vary depending on location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. You may also be offered a bonus, long-term incentives, and benefits. These ranges are subject to change.
