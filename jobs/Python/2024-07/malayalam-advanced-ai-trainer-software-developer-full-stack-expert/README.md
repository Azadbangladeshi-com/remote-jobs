**Malayalam Advanced AI Trainer Software Developer (Full-Stack Expert) - Fully Remote**

The Business Context

You already use AI in many ways‚Äîlike deciding what products and services to order‚Äîand it may be most familiar to you as a chatbot, as an avatar-maker, or as a way to unlock your screen. But here‚Äôs what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function.

But, like humans, algorithms are what they eat. They‚Äôre only as good as the rules they know and the data they‚Äôre trained on. We‚Äôre the team that helps model these behaviors.

The Role

As an Advanced AI Data Trainer you will be working closely with a team of other trainers, within protocols developed by the world‚Äôs leading AI researchers‚Äî training the AI to read, write, summarize knowledge, and interpret meaning. Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world‚Äôs most influential technology.

The goal of this AI is to be a safe, accurate, widely knowledgeable, and beneficial conversation partner to the world for a wide variety of purposes. Your job is to train, evaluate, and test the AI‚Äôs conversation skills, continuously equipping it to fulfill that purpose.

Day in and day out, you will:

**Train the AI**

You‚Äôll spend the bulk of your time generating examples of ideal conversations, acting as both the User and the AI for the AI to learn from, collecting sources helping it read large swaths of humanity‚Äôs documented knowledge and distinguish between what is presented as fact vs. context vs. patterns of behavior.

**Evaluate the AI**

Our partner‚Äôs mission is to develop AI models that are safe, accurate, and beneficial to humanity. You will continuously evaluate the AI according to those criteria and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they _interpret them._

**Test the AI**

How is testing different from evaluation? As the project grows over time, you‚Äôll spend time actively trying to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the AI by ‚Äúforcing‚Äù mistakes and improving the way these AI models recover. This is absolutely critical to its safety, accuracy, and use. You‚Äôll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client.

The Person

This is a technology job that accommodates humanities people and relies more fully on your _competencies_ than your formal experience‚Äì‚Äìmaking it a rare opportunity that‚Äôs perfect for new grads, career transitioners, and those seeking an exciting encore career.

You‚Äôre the sort of person who is exceptional at generating copy intuitively. You‚Äôve also got the metacognitive awareness to ‚Äúshow your work.‚Äù In addition, you‚Äôre the sort of person with a deep interest in linguistics. If you didn‚Äôt get a Ph.D., you probably wanted one. You instinctively document learnings and continuously refine methods.
