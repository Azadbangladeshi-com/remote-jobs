### Cruise  
#### `ðŸ’° $202,300 - $297,500` `ðŸŒŽ US Remote`  

The Behaviors Teams at Cruise are responsible for developing machine learning models to enable our AV to drive smoothly and safely around an urban environment. This includes working on a variety of really exciting problems such as:

Building a globally consistent prediction of what all different nearby agents (like other cars, buses, animals, pedestrians) are going to in the next few seconds Generating safe, comfortable and feasible trajectories to navigate dynamic urban environments Scoring and selecting the optimal trajectory, optimizing across many dimensions such as safety, comfort and customer experience.

The Behaviors teams work closely with our Perception partners to get data from a variety of sensors, with rich attributes, simulation data, high-fidelity maps, etc, all of which is necessary to build the above technologies. We also collaborate with Robotics and Controls partners to enable the car to follow the planned path accurately.

The Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer is a versatile role in Behaviors that drives a wide spectrum of applied ML research and development to overcome challenges on urban roads.
