## Description

At Scribd (pronounced ‚Äúscribbed‚Äù), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

  

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

  

Our flexible work benefit - Scribd Flex - enables employees, in partnership with their manager, to choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. As an organization, we prioritize collaboration and intentional in-person moments to build culture and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

Millions of active users discover our family of products (Scribd, Everand, and Slideshare) every day in order to learn, grow, and enjoy the latest premium books, audiobooks, podcasts, and more. This team is responsible for these core customer experiences on the web, including browsing, consumption, library management, and SEO. If you‚Äôre interested in a high-visibility role where your work will be seen and enjoyed by millions of engaged readers, this is the team for you!

  

  

 **As a Senior Frontend Web Applications Engineer**

  

We‚Äôre looking for highly experienced, communicative engineers to help empower our readers to indulge their curiosities and expand their knowledge by building exceptional products and user experiences. In this senior role, you will not only be responsible for delivering high-quality frontend solutions but also for leading technical discussions, setting standards, and mentoring other engineers. Our cross-functional squad involves deep collaboration with other engineering teams, designers, and product managers, so confidence, accountability, and excellent communication skills are paramount.

You will be expected to lead full-cycle frontend software development, advising on technical design, reviewing code, and driving best practices across the team. As a senior engineer, you'll be proactive in identifying areas for
improvement, proposing innovative solutions, and ensuring the maintainability and scalability of the codebase. You'll consider testability, upgradeability, scalability, and observability throughout the development process.
