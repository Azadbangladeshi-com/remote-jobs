**About Dune**

Dune is on a mission to make crypto data accessible. We’re a collaborative multi-chain analytics platform used by thousands of developers, analysts, & investors to understand the on-chain world and the frontiers of finance. We’re a team of ~50 employees, working together across Europe and eastern US timezones 🌍️. We believe in our mission, and in building a powerful, open product that allows individuals and communities to do deep research into important ecosystems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and many more.

 **About the role**

Dune is a small team building large things. We are generalist engineers who pick up any challenges together. We like to think and design before jumping into coding. We mainly use Typescript and Go (among other languages) to build scalable systems that are easy to build upon.  

As a software engineer in Dune focused on our applications, you will play a key role in ensuring a world-class experience for our users and customers on dune.com. Our application is written in Typescript, uses Next.js on the client and NodeJS on the server via GraphQL, and is hosted on Vercel and AWS, respectively.

 **In this role, you will:**

  * Work on both the front-end and back-end of our platform, implementing new features and improving existing ones.

  * Work closely with Product Managers, Designers, and other Engineers to deliver high-quality features that enhance the user experience on Dune.

  * Help ensure our applications are fast, reliable, and scalable.

  * Improve the content browsing experience and support users in creating and consuming queries and dashboards.

  * Produce clean, efficient, and maintainable TypeScript code focusing on best practices and long-term scalability.

  * Engage in continuous learning and collaborate with more senior engineers to enhance your skills and contribute effectively to the team.  

 **You might be a great fit for this role if:**

  * Have 4+ years of experience with React/Next.js for front-end development and Node.js with TypeScript for back-end development.

  * Are comfortable working with GraphQL and have a basic understanding of cloud-based infrastructure, particularly AWS and Kubernetes.

  * Are eager to develop your skills in scalable system design and contribute to the team’s technical goals.

  * Work well in a team environment and are comfortable communicating ideas and feedback in a distributed team.

  * Enjoy tackling challenges and finding solutions to enhance the user experience and overall performance of applications.

  * Take pride in writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

  * An entrepreneurial spirit, paired with strong problem-solving skills and a hands-on approach to software development.

  * Enjoy going fast!

 **Perks and Benefits**

  * A competitive salary and equity package 🚀. Both salary and equity is top 25% of companies in the space

  * Our employee equity scheme has world-class employee-friendly terms with a heavily discounted strike price (~90%) and a 10-year exercise window

  * 🏖 5 weeks PTO + local public holidays (that can be swapped to suit you)

  * 🧑‍💻 A fully remote-first approach within a distributed team with flexible working hours; you structure your own day 

  * Say goodbye to meeting overload! We believe in a healthy mix of async and sync work, so you can focus on what truly matters—no more wasted time on endless meetings!

  * Good health is important, so we offer private medical insurance, dental & vision as standard __ 🩺

  * We believe in paid parental leave 👶 to help you celebrate this important milestone, transition to your new life, and bond with your new baby. We offer 16 weeks to primary caregivers and 6 weeks to secondary caregivers, fully paid. Plus a 2-week part-time phased return at full pay to help you get used to your new (and slightly more complex!) schedule

  * Quarterly offsites in various exciting locations as a company or team to connect, work together and have fun (so far in Tuscany 🇮🇹 Berlin 🇩🇪 Austria 🇦🇹and Athens 🇬🇷).

  * On top of this 👆each person gets a yearly travel allowance to connect and co-work with someone or a team of people for a few days.

  * An allowance for your at-home setup, to ensure you are happy, comfortable and productive. If you prefer a local co-working space, we’ll pay for your desk.

  * Work with some of the best people you’ll ever get to meet!

  * And of course, you get some awesome Dune swag! ✌️😎
