### AtoB

## Description

Our mission

The trucking and logistics industry provides the backbone of the economy. But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.

  

**We're changing that.** AtoB is building Stripe for Transportation â€” modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics. Supply chains rely on the timely movement of capital to function efficiently. Our end game is a world in which that capital movement occurs fairly, smoothly, and without delay. As we pursue that end game, we aim to center our customers in every way â€” offering them world-class customer experience and building products that work with and around the unique constraints of their daily lives. We build for fleet managers in the office and drivers on the road. We strive for products that are efficient, satisfying, and useful. **Our customers enable our modern economy â€”** _ **they deserve it**_ **.**

  

Our history and background

Our founding team has backgrounds in payments, working on autonomous vehicles at Cruise Automation, leading ops and growth for Uber, and building apps that were featured on the Apple app store. We have staff and senior engineers from Google, Uber, Meta, Shopify, Stripe, Chime, and other leading technology companies.

  

We have raised $125 million+ from investors such as General Catalyst, Elad Gil, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, XYZ; founders and CEOs of companies such as Google (Eric Schmidt), Salesforce (Marc Benioff), Coinbase (Brian Armstrong), DoorDash (Tony Xu), Instacart, Gusto; strategic investors like Mastercard, Flexport and Samsara.

  

We were named to Forbes annual Next Billion-Dollar Startup List, and have just recently been selected to join the World Economic Forum as a Global Innovator.
