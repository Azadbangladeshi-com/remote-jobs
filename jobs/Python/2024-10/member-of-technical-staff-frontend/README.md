### **About the role**

Weâ€™re looking for a Staff Software Engineer for our Frontend team to help us build cutting-edge, AI-powered video creation and collaboration tools. Rather than specialists, weâ€™re seeking curiosity-driven engineers who are determined problem solvers and thrive in fast-paced, high-ownership environments. Our engineering team is highly collaborative and works on a wide variety of exciting challenges, including developing new interfaces for AI content creation and deploying cutting-edge computer vision and generative models to production.

### A peek at our technical stack

The rich UI of our generative AI tools is powered by **Typescript** and **React,** while the real time compositing and graphics engine behind our interactive preview runs on **WebGL2** and **WebAssembly.** Our API endpoints for real-time collaboration and media asset management are written in **Typescript** and **node.js**.

### What youâ€™ll do

  * Create rich multimedia interfaces using the latest, cutting-edge AI video generation models like Gen-3 Alpha.
  * Work with a world-class engineering team pushing the boundaries of creativity and content creation on the browser
  * Take on new challenges across the Frontend stack to implement new product features for Runwayâ€™s machine learning based generative AI tools
  * Improve the performance, reliability, and code quality of our codebases

### What youâ€™ll need

  * 3-6 years of industry experience in a software engineering role, ideally frontend focused
  * Demonstrated fluency of one or more programming languages, including but not limited to Javascript/Typescript
  * Experience in architecting production-ready systems and familiarity with debugging and profiling tools
  * Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines
  * Humility and open mindedness; at Runway we love to learn from one another

Runway strives to recruit and retain exceptional talent from diverse backgrounds while ensuring pay equity for our team. Our salary ranges are based on competitive market rates for our size, stage and industry, and salary is just one part of the overall compensation package we provide.

The range shared below is a general expectation for the function as posted, but we are also open to considering candidates who may be more or less experienced than outlined in the job description.
