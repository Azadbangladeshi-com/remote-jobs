To succeed in this position, it is important to have a proven track record of integrations across multiple complex systems at scale and to provide guidance for future integrations and implementations.

  * Assist in the development of integration processes for new products as they are developed and released
  * Collaborate with the Customer Experience Lead to understand customer requirements and provide tailored solutions that meet their needs
  * Develop and maintain a deep understanding of our products, including their technical architecture, APIs, and integration capabilities

**What you should bring:**

  * 5+ years of experience in technical implementation or integration roles (in the HR technology industry a plus)
  * Strong understanding and experience in APIs and webhook integrations (ideally in an event-driven architecture)
  * Advanced understanding and ability to explain system-to-system integrations
  * Ability to manage time and work effectively within a fast paced, dynamic environment
  * Proven track record of successfully managing complex technical projects under tight deadlines

**Nice to have:**

  * Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field
  * Workato or similar integration middleware experience
  * Experience in fast paced startup environments and remote international settings is strongly preferred
  * Proficiency in a high-level programming language for scripting needs, such as Javascript, Typescript or Python
  * Familiarity with APIs, OAuth and SSO authentication methods, MongoDB, web security and scale, and generally good practices and tooling for web development and access

**Salary Range:** $101,000 - $132,000 USD
