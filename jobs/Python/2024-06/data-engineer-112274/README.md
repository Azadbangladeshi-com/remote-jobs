Not something youâ€™d expect from one of the countryâ€™s biggest tech companies, is it?

And one of the best parts? We give you the autonomy to choose the working location that best suits your lifestyle â€“ Office, Hybrid or Anywhere.

  * Weâ€™re proud to be recognised as one of Australiaâ€™s Best Workplacesâ„¢ by Great Place to WorkÂ®, a Family Friendly Workplace, a WORK180 endorsed employer for women and WGEA Employer of Choice for Gender Equality.
  * The support of a highly engaged, high-performing team including a leadership team thatâ€™s youâ€™ll actually have face time with.
  * 22 weeks paid parental leave for primary caregivers, four weeks paid secondary caregivers leave, six weeks paid gender affirming care leave.

  * An all-of-business ownership mindset over siloed success, with high levels of personal integrity and accountability
  * Ability to understand well-defined engineering problems, and distil and solve them in robust ways
