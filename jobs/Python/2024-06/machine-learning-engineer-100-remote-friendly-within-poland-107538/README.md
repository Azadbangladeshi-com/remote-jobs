### **Company Description**

 **Welcome to the good side of tech üëã**

You might have heard about us, but with a different name: **ZnanyLekarz / Doctoralia.** It all started 10 years ago, when we asked ourselves: is anyone in healthcare thinking about patients? We jumped in and we empowered patients by giving them access to leave and read reviews about their visit. We then provided doctors with the technology to manage bookings easily and save time, so they could devote themselves to what they always wanted: treating patients. And today is the day in which we ask you: wanna join us in the next step of making the healthcare experience more human?

**Docplanner at scale**

We are leaders in 13 countries so far, and more than 90 million patients trust us every month. 300.000 specialists believe in us and our product, and so do leading venture capital funds such as Point Nine Capital, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and One Peak Partners. And yet, employing over 2.500 people all over the globe, we managed to keep the startup-mindset we started with over 10 years ago.

 **How does Docplanner Tech fit here?**

At Docplanner Tech we are a diverse group of over 400 people working in Engineering, Data, and Product teams. We are responsible for building the product for all locations. Many of us have been here for over 5 years, yet we still welcome each new person with great joy and excitement.

We could tell you about us, but we will let our reviews on Glassdoor speak for themselves. In case you‚Äôd like to see how it feels to be 100% yourself at work, here‚Äôs a video of us.

**And why should you join us?**

We work on projects that deliver extraordinary value to doctors and patients - we save doctors‚Äô time, allow them focus on patients and their case. Patients receive better care. So you go to bed knowing that what you do matters,

We want to make the healthcare experience more human, and that starts with you being you. We believe that taking the diversity of human experience into account makes a better healthcare experience for all . We‚Äôre not just different: we embrace diversity. We will encourage you to come to work your whole self, and that includes not coming to the office at all if you prefer not to, as we're 100% remote friendly.
