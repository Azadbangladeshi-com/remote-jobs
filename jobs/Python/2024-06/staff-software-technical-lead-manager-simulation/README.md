### Cruise  
#### `ðŸŒŽ US Remote`  

Simulation at Cruise is responsible for constructing virtual environments to guarantee safety, comfort and efficiency of our autonomous vehicles. Our products accelerate autonomous vehicle development, testing, and deployment by efficiently simulating and testing our autonomous vehicle software against billions of miles of driving - a task that would otherwise require years of on-road testing. Simulation develops end-to-end frameworks, test pipelines, assets, and tools to enable our fleets to scale in the real world.

As a Staff Software TLM on the Simulation team, you will lead a team of high-caliber software engineers driving development and integration of our automated simulation test pipelines to solve mission-critical testing and evaluation problems. These pipelines will automatically gather road data, create new tests, validate existing tests, and actively power rapid developer iteration for model training and performance evaluation. You will own a rapidly scaling user-facing test product designed to enhance engineering development speed across the entirety of Cruise.

As a technical leader within Cruise, your role will involve fostering the growth of strong, content and engaged teams, enabling them to deliver exceptional work. Your team will collaborate closely with a diverse team across AV Engineering, Systems Engineering, Product Management, Product Operations, as well as SWEs within the Simulation framework and tooling teams, to deliver impactful simulation software solutions.

## What you'll be doing:

  * Lead a team of exceptional software engineers, sculpting automated test tools and pipelines for simulation test creation, maintenance and execution
  * Drive and influence strategic decisions on simulation tooling architecture, implementation and delivery of large-scale software solutions for testing and performance evaluation of autonomous vehicle software stack
  * Steer product vision and execution of user-efficient tools from ideation to production for multiple simulation authorship and management workflows
  * Develop and oversee top-tier software engineers within a dynamic, fast-paced, and inclusive setting
  * Partner with engineering and product leadership across simulation and cross functional teams on intricate simulation test challenges and roadmaps for immediate and future needs

## What you must have:

  * BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, or equivalent experience  

    * Equivalent experience includes technical leadership in a complex space, driving technical design and execution cross-collaboratively across multiple teams and organizations
  * 8+ years relevant industry experience, including 3+ years of experience leading and managing high-caliber software engineers
  * Strong programming skills in Python
  * Experience building developer productivity tools that scale effectively with a high degree of product excellence
  * Passion for building tools, frameworks and libraries that simplify complex workflows

**Bonus points!**

  * Experience with C++
  * Experience with SQL programming
  * Experience with driving customer adoption up and scale product
  * Familiarity with dashboarding systems for displaying and exploring metrics over time (i.e. Looker, Tableau, Kibana)
  * Experience with verification and validation of complex and/or safety critical systems

_The salary range for this position_ _is $171,400 - $252,000. Compensation will vary depending on location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. You may also be offered a bonus, long-term incentives, and benefits. These ranges are subject to change._
