# [Senior Software Engineer II, Simulation](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-ii-simulation-107841)  
### Cruise  
#### `ðŸŒŽ US Remote`  

Simulation at Cruise is responsible for constructing virtual environments to guarantee safety, comfort and efficiency of our autonomous vehicles. Our products accelerate autonomous vehicle development, testing, and deployment by efficiently simulating and testing our autonomous vehicle software against billions of miles of driving - a task that would otherwise require years of on-road testing. Simulation develops end-to-end frameworks, test pipelines, assets, and tools to enable our fleets to scale in the real world.

As a software engineer on the Simulation team, you will be in the driver seat of our mission to revolutionize autonomous vehicle testing and evaluation in simulation. Your primary focus will be to drive development and integration of our automated simulation test pipelines to solve mission-critical testing and evaluation problems. These pipelines will automatically gather road data, create new tests, validate existing tests, and actively power rapid developer iteration for model training and performance evaluation. You will also develop user-efficiency tools for simulation management and authoring workflows to help test creators generate millions of simulations.

You will collaborate closely with a diverse team across AV Engineering, Systems Engineering, Product Management, Product Operations, as well as SWEs within the Simulation framework and tooling teams, to deliver impactful simulation software solutions.

## What you'll be doing:

  * Build automated tools and pipelines for simulation test creation, maintenance and execution to accelerate training of ML models and end-to-end performance evaluation
  * Develop and integrate test productivity and debugging scripts to enable efficient customer workflows
  * Design and implement engineering solutions to tackle complex simulation testing problems, focused towards performance and scale
  * Collaborate across teams, with AV Engineers, Product Managers, Product Operations, Systems Engineers, and Simulation to enhance the user experience of simulation tools and improve the development speed of Cruise engineers and Offshore teams

## What you must have:

  * BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, or equivalent experience
    * Equivalent experience includes technical leadership in a complex space, driving technical design and execution cross-collaboratively across multiple teams and organizations
  * 5+ years relevant industry experience
  * Strong programming skills in Python
  * Passion for building tools, frameworks and libraries that simplify complex workflows
  * Proven track record of effective collaboration with customers and continuous delivery of quality results

**Bonus points!**

  * Experience with C++
  * Experience with SQL programming
  * Experience with BigQuery, GCP
  * Experience with verification and validation of complex and/or safety critical systems within robotics, autonomous driving or related field

_The salary range for this_ _position is $142,800 - $210,000. Compensation will vary depending on location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. You may also be offered a bonus, long-term incentives, and benefits. These ranges are subject to change._
