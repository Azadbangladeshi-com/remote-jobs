### Nillion  
#### `üåé New York, New York, United States`  

### **Description**

Nillion is humanity‚Äôs first Blind Computer. It is powered by a decentralized network of nodes that enables ‚ÄúBlind Computation‚Äù through the coordination and orchestration of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) such as multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Nillion believes Blind Computation will become the internet‚Äôs base layer for all private data as PETs continue to mature. Nillion has attracted a notable initial cohort of Blind Computation builders across AI, DeFi, medical data, custody, wallets, global identity, messaging and much more.

As reported by TechCrunch, Nillion in the midst of the bear market of 2022 raised the highest valuation for a Seed Round reported in Q4-2022. The project has attracted some of the top talent in tech, including the Founder of Indiegogo (Slava Rubin), Associate General Counsel of Coinbase (Lindsay Danas Cohen), Co-Founder of Hedera Hashgraph (Andrew Masanto) and several other high profile team members.

As a Senior DevOps Engineer at Nillion, you will work on internally focused cloud infrastructure and externally focused deployment kits for node operators.This role at Nillion will play a critical role in bringing to life a new security, storage and computation model for sensitive data across a decentralized publicly accessible network. Expertise across all areas of computer science will thus be needed.

###  **About Nillion**

Nillion is a decentralized public network based on a novel cryptographic primitive we call Nil Message Compute (NMC). NMC allows for arbitrary computation constructions to be built on top of a proprietary decentralized data store in an efficient manner with no node-to-node communication during the computation step, which allows for the creation of a new type of decentralized network that greatly expands the possibilities of decentralized computing.
