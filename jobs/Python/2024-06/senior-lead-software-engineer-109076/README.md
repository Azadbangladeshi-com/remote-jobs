  * Write test plan specifications for small-sized features in EOS, and implement automated test programs to execute the cases described in the test plan.
  * Debug problems found by our automated test programs and fix the problems. 
  * Work on a team implementing, testing, and debugging solutions to larger routing protocol problems.
  * Worth with Customer Support Engineers to analyze problems in customer networks and provide fixes for those problems when needed in the form of new software releases or software patches.
  * Work with the System Test Engineers to analyze problems found in their tests and provide fixes for those problems.
  * Mentor new and junior engineers to bring them up to speed in Aristaâ€™s software development environment.
  * Review and contribute to the specifications and implementations written by other team members.
  * Help to create a schedule for the implementation and debugging tasks, update that schedule weekly, and report it to the project lead.

  * Layer 2 features such as 802.1d bridging, the 802.1d Spanning Tree Protocol, the 802.1ax Link Aggregation Control Protocol, the 802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol, or RFC 1812 IP routing.
  * Ability to utilize, test, and debug packet forwarding engine and a hardware componentâ€™s vendor provided software libraries in your solutions.
  * Infrastructure functions related to distributed systems such as messaging, signalling, databases, and command line interface techniques.
  * Hands on experience in the design and development of ethernet bridging or routing related software or distributed systems software is desirable.
  * Hands on experience with enterprise or service provider class Ethernet switch/router system software development, or significant PhD level research in the area of network routing and packet forwarding.
  * Applied understanding of software engineering principles.
