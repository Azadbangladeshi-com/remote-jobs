**SR. GNC ENGINEER - MISSION FORMULATION**

Based out of Rocket Labâ€™s global headquarters in Long Beach, CA, Littleton, CO or working remotely, the Sr. GNC Engineer - Mission Formulation is responsible for Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) design, modeling, analyses, and testing for Rocket Lab launches and missions. The Sr. GNC Engineer is an integral part of Rocket Labâ€™s Global Launch Services (GLS) Mission Formulation Team which works closely with other Engineering teams and Production to bring new launch and mission concepts to life.

As part of the Mission Formulation team, the Sr. GNC Engineer is responsible for conducting trades studies, preliminary and final mission analyses, and definition and implementation of detailed designs for Rocket Labâ€™s launch programs. This team is also primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of launches and missions for classified missions on HASTE and Electron launch vehicles.

Success in this position will be measured by the value of the knowledge and experience in launch vehicle design and mission experience that you bring into this role, your ability to contribute to projects without supervision, successful collaboration with other teams across Rocket Lab, and the skillful prioritization of competing engineering projects across the group.

**WHAT YOUâ€™LL GET TO DO:**

  * GNC contact to Business Development for proposals and mission definition 
  * Launch and mission operational concept development 
  * Orbital and suborbital trajectory design and analysis 
  * Work with external stakeholders and customers for mission-specific requirements engineering 
  * Document proposed GNC solutions and participate in design reviews with customers 
  * Support hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing to verify trajectories, GNC, and flight code performance 
  * Conduct Monte Carlo simulation analyses to define and verify launch and mission operations 
  * Develop and support release of flight code for pre-launch ground testing, launch, and mission operations 
  * Conduct flight safety analyses prior to launch and provide related day-of-launch support 
  * Verify readiness of AFTS (Automated Flight Termination System) hardware and software 
  * Develop tools and processes for automating common GNC modelling and analysis tasks 

**QUALIFICATIONS YOUâ€™LL BRING** _:_

  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering (Aerospace/Mechanical/Electrical Engineering) 
  * 5+ years working experience in an engineering or analytical role 
  * Proven experience developing real-time control and/or estimation algorithms in autonomous vehicles, preferably launch vehicles 

**THESE QUALIFICATIONS WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE:**

  * Experience with requirements assessments and interface control document generation 
  * Experience with git version control. 
  * 3+ yearsâ€™ experience in modelling, simulation and/or control of dynamics systems, particularly rigid bodies 
  * 3+ yearsâ€™ experience with Python development 
  * 3+ yearsâ€™ experience with data analysis using MATLAB and/or SciPy 
  * Experience developing in C/C++ 
  * Experience with ASTOS or similar mission analysis, trajectory optimization, vehicle design and simulation tools 
  * Strong communication skills, with the ability to build strong working relationships 
  * Creative, analytical, and good at problem solving 
  * Ability to work on own initiative and to plan daily workflow to meet higher level tasks
