# About One

One‚Äôs mission is simple - to help customers achieve financial progress. We‚Äôre doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, borrow, and grow their money ‚Äì all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can‚Äôt access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world‚Äôs largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There‚Äôs never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!

# The Role

Software Engineers on One‚Äôs Core App Team own the mobile and web codebase that drives our user experience. Besides writing, reviewing, and shipping code, engineers collaborate with others across the company, from Product, Design, and Data to, Customer Support, Ops, and Compliance. Software Engineers at One are highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent.  

  * Work closely with other engineers to ship code. We enjoy collaboration and partnering on hard problems. 

  * Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define and prioritize features and technical initiatives.

  * Lead the technical planning and architecture discussions for frontend systems.

  * Add to the overall user experience through surprise and delight.

  * Build and maintain documentation. As a growing and remote organization, having the necessary docs are key to our success. 

# You bring

  * 5 + years of professional experience building, shipping ‚Äî and growing ‚Äî with a User-centric approach

  * Proactively seek opportunities to improve user experience through backend optimizations and enhancements

  * Familiarity with message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) and caching solutions.

  * Experience leading, mentoring, and demonstrating excellence in execution. You need little oversight when given a problem to solve, and you have a track record of getting things done.

  * Passion for your craft and care for the people you work with. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.

  * Proven track record of making impactful improvements to user experience

  * A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hope you‚Äôll be here for a while, and there‚Äôs no better investment than in our people.

  * The Triple H Factor: Hungry, Humble, Honest

## Tools we use

We use the fp-ts library for functional programming with Node/TypeScript running on top of Kubernetes and AWS. We believe great engineers can learn any stack, so you **do not need experience** with these specific tools, but you‚Äôll ramp up more quickly if you are familiar with functional programming concepts.

## Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $135,000 to $220,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

## What it's like working @ One

  * Competitive cash

  * Benefits effective on day one

  * Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech

  * Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup

  * Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule

  * Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave

  * 401(k) plan with match

# Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we‚Äôve adopted a flat titling structure at One. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. ‚ÄúEngineer, Platform‚Äù, ‚ÄúSales, Business Development‚Äù or ‚ÄúManager, Talent‚Äù). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within One.

# Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us at talent@one.app.
