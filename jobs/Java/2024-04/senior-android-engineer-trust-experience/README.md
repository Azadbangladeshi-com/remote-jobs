Description

Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

 **The Community You Will Join:**

Airbnb is built on trust. Over two million people stay on Airbnb every night and the Trust Engineering team keeps our hosts and guests safe and supported throughout the entire Airbnb experience.

As part of the Trust Engineering team you will be in charge of designing and building scalable and robust systems to detect and mitigate fraud across our entire platform. You will be deeply involved in the technical details of building highly available and real-time risk detection services in close collaboration with product, data science and operations teams to understand ever evolving attack vectors and to keep Airbnb a safe and trusted community.

There are still many unsolved problems to tackle in both online and offline risk, and we're looking for talented engineers to solve these challenges with us.

  * Include insight to the working environment: 
    * About the team: Trust Experience provides front-end resources to a variety of trust and safety related projects, both inside and outside the greater Trust organization. We touch code all over the app, on both the guest and host sides and get exposed to company-wide initiatives at all scales. We are made up of web, iOS and Android engineers and occasionally do full stack work as well.
