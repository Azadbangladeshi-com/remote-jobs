Argyle is a fast-growing, remote-first Series B startup solving a systemic data problem.

Underneath the consumer finance industryâ€™s decisions and processes is static, analog documentationâ€”things like credit reports and paystubsâ€”designed decades ago for a world that no longer exists. Meanwhile, credit bureaus buy, move, store, and sell consumersâ€™ data without their knowledge or consent.

The result? A labyrinth of manual workflows and shortsighted underwriting models that obstruct financial access, compound operational costs, and impede innovation.

The solution is Argyle. Weâ€™re a real-time income data platform that lets our end-users instantly connect their employment records to apps and websites, so they can access and qualify for the financial resources they need to get ahead. Providers benefit from streamlined workflows and enhanced visibility that reduce costs and risk across the user journey.

Our mission is to give consumers the means to exercise ownership over their income, employment, and identity data in order to create a more equal, efficient, and effective financial system for everybody.

If youâ€™re looking to join a fun and ambitious group of people working remotely across dozens of countries, apply today.
