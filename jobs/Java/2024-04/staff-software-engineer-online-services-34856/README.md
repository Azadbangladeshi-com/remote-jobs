Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.

Affirmâ€™s engineering team is building a large-scale, fault-tolerant, and global infrastructure that is shared across multiple financial products. Ensuring that our infrastructure is available to all engineers is critical to the success of the business. We pride ourselves on our culture across engineering of writing blameless postmortems as well as writing detailed tech specs and gathering feedback before large changes to systems.

As a team, Online Services is responsible for building and exposing simple interfaces of online infrastructure components. Our customers are not only Affirm users, but also other engineering teams at Affirm. These components are ultimately used in the application development lifecycle. The Online Services team owns two infrastructure areas of Affirmâ€™s core product: Traffic Engineering and Cloud Services - we are looking for a technical lead for either or both of these areas. The Traffic Engineering area owns the end-to-end lifecycle of online requests, including our edge Content Delivery Network (CDN), load balancers, API gateway, and service mesh. The Cloud Services area oversees critical security and platform services like secrets management, encryption APIs, caching, and config management.

### What you'll do

  * Lead technical decisions, projects, and roadmaps within the Online Services team. 
  * Be an expert in the Traffic Engineering area, the Cloud Services area, or both areas.
  * Collaborate with other technical leads, management, and stakeholders across the platform engineering and product engineering organizations.
  * Design and build frameworks, services, and tools to handle new Affirm products and business requirements that securely scale over millions of users and their transactions.
  * Educate, mentor and grow junior and senior engineers in the team, and drive best practices around design, coding, and testing.

### What we look for

  * 7+ years of software development experience
  * Experience designing and owning fault-tolerant, multi-region online backend infrastructure systems.
  * Proven CS fundamentals and hands on coding and debugging experience using modern software delivery methods to develop services using Python, Go, or JVM-based languages (Java, Kotlin, Scala)
  * Experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and/or other cloud providers like Azure or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
  * Experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools such as Terraform, Cloudformation, Pulumi, etc
  * You value keeping costs low while building your products. You prefer using, enhancing, and contributing to open source solutions rather than building solutions from ground up.
  * Familiarity with Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) is a plus. We use technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, gRPC, Istio, Envoy, and NGINX, but we are always looking for new technologies to adopt.
  * Familiarity with cloud networking, request routing, or traffic management is a plus. 
  * Familiarity with online security services is a plus. These include Web Application Firewalls (WAF), Authentication and Authorization systems, secrets management, certificate management, encryption services, etc
  * Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, related technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience.
