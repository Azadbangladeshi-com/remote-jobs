The Modern Billpay initiative is an exciting opportunity to solve complex challenges and to build a novel Platform that is going to power the next generation of Amex financial products. We are a team of entrepreneurial disruptors with a great FinTech Engineering culture at the forefront of innovation in the industry. We are building Billpay services ‚Äì that allow scheduling and executing payments for our Amex customer, AI/ML driven data pipelines, and fluid integrators with Global Payment Infrastructure and the banking system.

Our team is responsible for mission critical customer journeys, including ‚ÄúPay your Amex Bill,‚Äù ‚ÄúPlan your Bill Payments‚Äù and ‚ÄúReceive & reconcile Bank Transfers‚Äù. Our goal is to decouple our assets, such as our clearing engine and bank validation, and make it easy for others in the company to build world class Bill payment experiences.

We are looking for Engineers that are open-minded, willing to learn, and are passionate about building great software. As we decide if an Engineer is a fit for our Team, we will not focus solely on experience or languages used, but the ability to think out of the box and approach problems with a clever mindset. We are influenced by The Twelve-Factor App principles, and we have picked modern ergonomic languages that maximize productivity and readability, i.e., modern JVM: Quarkus/Micronaut with Kotlin and lightweight Go command tools. Architecture is event driven microservices leveraging Kafka and Webhooks, and our polyglot-persistence includes Oracle, Postgres, and Cassandra.
