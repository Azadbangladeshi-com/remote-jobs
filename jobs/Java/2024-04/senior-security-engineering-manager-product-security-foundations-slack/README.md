 ** **About Salesforce****

Weâ€™re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too â€” driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good â€“ youâ€™ve come to the right place.

Slack's Product Security Team supports the following tenet of Slackâ€™s mission: make peopleâ€™s working lives more secure. Weâ€™re serious about building a simple-to-use yet secure product, and most importantly, protecting our customersâ€™ data. We take a systematic approach to security and strive to ensure we provide low friction, and high-impact security across everything we do. As a member of the Product Security team, you care about shipping secure products and ensuring the way in for the bad actors is never through the front door (or the back)! You are passionate about enabling our developers to ship secure products. You think about your team as not fixing bugs but developing effective ways to prevent them. Your work will directly impact the way millions of people, teams, and businesses get things done using Slack.

Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive cultureâ€”we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking, and above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?

## Overview

The Product Security Foundations (PSF) group is a dedicated software engineering team within Product Security focused on streamlining the process of secure development, ensuring it is user-friendly for all engineers. A critical aspect of this is creating standardized methods, libraries, tools, and services for engineers across Slack. Join an existing, high-performance, thoughtful team and help make the secure choice the easy one for all of the engineers at Slack! Examples of work this team owns include authorization frameworks that support Slack APIs, core authentication libraries, safe image, and attachment processing, in addition to other secure by default libraries.

  * Lead multiple concurrent projects while effectively solving problems that cross product boundaries.

  * Establish strong partnerships and champion quality throughout a cross-functional organization to support the best possible security and engineering outcomes.

  * Work closely with other Slack Security Sister teams to identify, track and remediate risk.
