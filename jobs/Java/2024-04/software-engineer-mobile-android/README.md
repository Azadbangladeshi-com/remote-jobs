Sprout Social is looking to hire an Android Engineer to the Engineering team.

**Why join Sprout‚Äôs Engineering team?**

With collaborative cross-functional teams that span mobile, front-end, back-end, QA and site reliability engineering‚Äîthe Sprout Engineering team is a place to sharpen your craft and solve hard problems with the smartest people in the industry. You‚Äôll get to work on a ‚Äútech-giant‚Äù scale with smaller, supportive teams where every engineer has the chance to make an impact on our company, and our customers. The best part? In our industry, you often have to switch jobs or even companies to learn a new part of a tech stack or business. But at Sprout, our product is a suite, so you just need to move teams. You‚Äôre able to diversify your skills, which not only benefits your team‚Äîbut also your career.

**How you‚Äôll grow**

Within 1 month, you‚Äôll plant your roots, including:

  * Attending and completing Sprout Social‚Äôs two-week new hire training and onboarding program alongside other new Sprout team members. In these sessions, you will gain a broad understanding of our products and how your role directly impacts the product, overall organization, and our customers.
  * Making a plan with your manager to set initial priorities, align on expectations for your role, plant goalposts for your career, and learn about Sprout‚Äôs approach to mobile engineering.
