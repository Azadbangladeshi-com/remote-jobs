The business experience teamâ€™s mission is to empower brands, organizations and professionals to create engaging content for our communities while growing their presence on Reddit. This is a high impact role where you will be involved in technical & product strategy on a zero to one product. Youâ€™ll have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a new product space with a 100M+ revenue opportunity.

**What Youâ€™ll Do:**

  * Work cross-functionally with product, design, and other engineering counterparts to execute on product and business strategy and build novel products and features that our users will love.
  * Contribute to the full development cycle: technical design, development, test, experimentation, analysis, and launch. Youâ€™ll be reviewing code and design docs, giving feedback on product specs and mocks.
  * Participate with a team of thoughtful, fast-moving, and motivated engineers. Contribute to standards that improve developer workflows, recommend best practices, and help mentor junior engineers on the team to grow their technical expertise.
  * Continuously learn and improve your technical and non-technical abilities.

**Role Requirements:**

  * BS degree in Computer Science, a similar technical field of study or equivalent practical experience
  * 4+ years of hands-on, professional software development experience developing user-facing Android mobile native applications at scale, using Java or Kotlin 
  * Experience in one or more general purpose programming languages (Java, C++, Python, Kotlin)
  * Experience with GraphQL, REST, HTTP basics, and the ability to design and implement maintainable APIs is a plus
  * Familiarity with software engineering best practices such as unit/integration/end-to-end testing, design documents, CI/CD, A/B testing, code reviews, and documentation
  * A track record of leading sized projects that require cross-team and cross-functional collaborations
  * Strong organizational skills, the ability to prioritize tasks and to deliver projects on schedule
  * Entrepreneurial spirit. You are self-directed, innovative, and biased towards action in fast-paced environments. You love to build new things and thrive in ambiguity and even failure.
  * Excellent communication skills. You partner effectively with teams in a fully remote environment and discuss complex topics with technical and non-technical audiences.
