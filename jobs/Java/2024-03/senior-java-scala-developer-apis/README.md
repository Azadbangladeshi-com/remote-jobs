The Opportunity

The Software Developer will work as part of Unacastâ€™s API team, assisting in the development of customer-facing and internal APIs with an emphasis on fast querying of large data sets. Successful candidates will demonstrate an ability to translate business problems into technology solutions and products while overseeing the full application life cycle. You have a strong grasp of the Java and/or Scala programming languages. As a member of the API team, the developer will work closely with both engineering and product-development to deliver creative and effective solutions. As a result, candidates should have both the ability to work as part of a team while also demonstrating personal initiative. In summary, a successful candidate will be able to demonstrate technical expertise, be teamwork-oriented, and be committed to developing high-quality code.

  
This position requires significant prior work experience developing in Java and/or Scala and should have prior experience with the Java Spring Framework. Experience with database management and SQL querying is also beneficial as well as working in Amazon Web Services. The ideal candidate will be team and customer service oriented, innovative, open-minded to the solution set, and driven to deliver solutions that meet or exceed requirements.

  * Collaborating with the engineering team on the optimal design and maintenance of the large Snowflake data lake that powers the APIs. This includes database table design and efficient SQL querying to produce short API response times.
  * Create quality internal and external documentation for your work. Internal documentation is critical during the development and maintenance of a project and comprehensive external documentation is essential for customer onboarding. 
  * Create data, metrics and visualizations, as needed, for complex algorithm verification and optimization.

  * Experience with data analytics and data visualization.
  * You are both a team player and a self-starter. You have demonstrated the ability to work independently with only basic guidance, as well as work well within the larger team.
  * You have demonstrated experience understanding and meeting customer and partner needs, and deploying the right tool for the job including Scala, Java, and third party web services.
  * You are capable of taking a basic description of what is needed, analyzing it and asking the right questions to generate a detailed specification of the software requirements.
  * You can demonstrate to us that you have developed multiple applications from conception, through initial requirements gathering and design, to product release and revisions.
