Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time-consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have a choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Working closely with other engineers, you'll play a critical part in the entire software development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
  * You'll collaborate with cross-functional team members to align on project goals and milestones, ensuring smooth and efficient project execution.
  * Your technical expertise will be vital in contributing to the success of our projects and in supporting the continuous improvement of our processes and products.

### You're probably a match if

  * You are a Software Engineer (Java) who will actively contribute to the development and optimization of our Core Media team's microservices, focusing on images and fonts, by writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
  * You are comfortable with computer science and engineering fundamentals: concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems
  * You will collaborate with other teams and stakeholders, such as Creators, Editing, Search & Recommendation, and Export, to contribute to the development and implementation of product initiatives.

### About the team

The Media Platform group is on a mission to build a platform that can process, store and distribute billions of images, videos, and audio efficiently.

The Core Media team within the Media Platform group is responsible for the ingredients that are at the core of Canva experiences: images and fonts. We also manage the licensing of these ingredients in the Canva library to ensure users and contributors benefit from our growing ecosystem. Our team owns and operates some of the biggest scale services at Canva, dealing with billions of content, and unlocking other teams to ship their best features.

This is also an exciting time to join Media Platform because we are building the next generation of the platform, including a unified interface for other services to access ingredients.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and support you personally
