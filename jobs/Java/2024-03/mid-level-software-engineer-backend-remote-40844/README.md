**Mid-Level Software Engineer - Backend - (Remote)**

Software Engineer

Your opportunity

As the group responsible for telemetry data ingest, storage and query functionality, the Data Platform group at New Relic is the foundation of all of the company's products. Engineers working on the New Relic Database (NRDB) contribute directly to the proprietary database technology at the heart of it all.

  

The NRDB Core Architecture team, which is part of the Data Platform group, is responsible for innovating and building the state-of-the-art, highly-scalable, and high-performance distributed database system. As a member of the team, you will work alongside some of our most knowledgeable and collaborative engineers to address challenging problems in the domain.

We're looking for mid-level software engineers to join our team. If the idea of working on a system that ingests billions of data points per minute, serves billions of web requests per day, and processes millions of messages per second at exabyte scale sounds appealing, please be in touch.

  

What you'll do

  * Build and maintain scalable distributed Java services and Infrastructure.
  * Participate in architectural definition meetings with a high degree of innovation and creativity.
  * Investigate and resolve critical performance, availability, and resiliency issues and risks in a multi-region, multi-cloud, multi-tenant distributed database.
  * Working in an agile environment with a DevOps approach â€” the team builds and maintains their own software, including taking turns with being on-call.

  

This role requires

  * 3+ years of professional experience in distributed SaaS software development.
  * Strong experience in writing software in Java and high-throughput software development best-practices.
  * Experience using the command line to manage, investigate, and fix things when theyâ€™re broken.
  * Experience with databases like MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Redis, MongoDB, etc.
  * Familiarity with the public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  * Familiarity with Kubernetes or Docker.
  * A collaborative work style that includes colleagues in important decisions and leads to shared code ownership

  

Bonus points if you have

  * Familiarity with networks and load-balancing and how to use them well in low-latency, high-throughput distributed systems.
  * Familiarity with modern observability and alerting patterns.
  * Ability to work well asynchronously and effectively communicate your thoughts in writing.
