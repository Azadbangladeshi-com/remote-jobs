Why This Role MattersOur customers are software developers, security officers, and DevOps managers. We offer them subscriptions to valuable software that works. As long as our customers value their investment, they will continue to renew and expand their deployments. Fortunately, our customers trust Sonatype and value their investments. This is proven by our 90%+ renewal rate -- one of the highest renewal rates in the software subscription business. We are also proud of receiving a coveted 2021 Gainsight GameChanger award for our outstanding customer services. But we choose not to rest on our laurels. If our customers are not optimized, adequately deployed, or have compromised rollouts due to their lack of time, technical know-how/resources, or understanding of best practices - it will inhibit our mutual ability to achieve success. That is why this role is so meaningful.

  * Develop custom scripts integrating core product functionality with related tooling

  * Modern build tools (e.g., Jenkins)
  * Package managers (e.g., Maven, Gradle, Nuget, NPM, etc.)
  * Artifact repositories (e.g., Nexus Repository Manager)
  * Continuous Delivery technologies (e.g., Puppet, Chef, Udeploy, XL Deploy, etc.)
  * Container technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Openshift, etc.)
  * Experience initiating and driving technical projects to completion
  * Fluency in the English language - spoken and written
