### Recidiviz  
#### `üí∞ 252000.0` `üåé United States`  

Recidiviz is thrilled to be hiring a Product Growth Lead to join our product team! We‚Äôre a small, fast-moving reform group that builds tools for users responsible for decision making within corrections and sentencing, from parole officers to people who‚Äôve been impacted by the system. This is where you come in. We‚Äôre looking for someone to develop the go-to-market strategy and work closely with our product and state engagement managers to increase engagement and impact of Recidiviz tools.

 _ **  
This role is being promoted under the following titles: Go-To-Market Lead, Sales Enablement Lead, and Product Growth Lead. Please only apply to one.**_

###  
About us

Recidiviz is creating safer, healthier communities by improving outcomes for justice-involved people. We build tech that reduces the number of people in prison and helps criminal justice leaders embrace data-driven decision-making.

Using modern data infrastructure and thoughtful product design, we‚Äôve been able to safely and permanently reduce incarceration and improve outcomes. We work side-by-side with leaders of the criminal justice system, people impacted by the system, and ecosystem partners to build a better path forward. In addition to the revenue we earn from state partners, some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations support our work.

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them.

### About the role

For this role, we‚Äôre looking for a strategic, analytical, and empathetic person who is able to quickly develop a deep understanding of our users and tools. You‚Äôll not just help launch, but ‚Äúland‚Äù our tools with a diverse set of users, including:

  * Develop the go-to-market strategy for our tools across multiple states and users
  * Test, experiment, and iterate on that strategy to maximize user adoption across states, agencies, and roles in the system
  * Build the organizational capacity to scale and sustain the go-to-market strategy
  * Manage our current go-to-market manager, as well as any future go-to-market team members. The GTM team is responsible for both managing support requests from users, as well as developing roll-out approaches and training / proactively engaging users.
  * Travel domestically within the United States to partner states, where you and your team will help train and engage corrections line staff on using our tools. 

**Please note: This role requires 10-25% travel, about 1-3 trips per quarter.**

You‚Äôre a great fit for the role if you‚Äôve previously held Sales Enablement, Marketing, Partnerships, or GTM leadership positions for technology where you‚Äôve needed to build and iterate on adoption and go-to-market strategy‚Äîespecially if it‚Äôs involved government / enterprise adoption or ground game.

### Core responsibilities

  * You‚Äôll increase the impact that our tools have, whether that‚Äôs helping more people complete parole and probation sooner or reducing admissions to prison
  * You‚Äôll increase adoption of our tools so more users are engaging with the tools weekly and monthly
  * You‚Äôll provide feedback to our product and partnerships teams, to help improve both our tools and our outreach to better effect change,
  * Your team, which you will grow and manage, will be the face of Recidiviz that thousands of criminal justice actors know and trust

### Wild success

  * Within one year in the role, you‚Äôll have achieved wild success if we see:
    * Sustained increases in user engagement of Recidiviz tools
    * Increased rate at which justice-impacted people are getting closer to liberty
    * Clarity on which go-to-market strategies are most effective, for which tools, in which places, plus a plan to scale and sustain these strategies across all Recidiviz partner states 

### Qualifications

  * You have at least 5 years of experience with adoption and/or go-to-market strategy, including working with technical teams and representing software products to users
  * You thrive in ambiguity
    * You enjoy building external strategies from the ground up. You think big picture, outside the box and proactively identify ways to make ambiguous problems clear. You have demonstrated experience growing a dedicated function and scaling its impact.
  * You are analytical
    * You are data-driven in your approach to developing a go-to-market strategy. You can build the structure and processes to evaluate and scale GTM strategies.
  * You are an empathetic communicator and collaborator
    * You are able to quickly build rapport and trust with a diverse array of external and internal stakeholders. You advise leadership and the broader organization on specific go-to-market decisions and can communicate long term strategic plans clearly and convincingly. You work well with cross-functional teams and are able to handle organizational decisions professionally and kindly.
  * You have strong people management skills
    * You‚Äôre an experienced manager with a track record for building high-functioning, cohesive teams. You can recruit and mentor individual contributors across the go-to-market team.

### More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we‚Äôve built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator‚Äôs 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) 11 state partners ‚Äì big and small, red and blue ‚Äì and covers 25% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners ‚Äì from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.
