### Meet Upside:

We created Upside to transform brick-and-mortar commerce. Our technology uses the sophistication of online retailâ€”profit measurement, attribution, and incrementalityâ€”to provide users with more value on their everyday purchases and brick-and-mortar businesses with new, profitable customers. Weâ€™ve helped millions of users earn 2 to 3 times more cashback than any other product, and hundreds of thousands of brick-and-mortar businesses earn measurable profit. Billions of dollars in commerce run through the Upside platform every year, and that value goes directly back to our retailer partners, the consumers they serve, and important sustainability initiatives.
