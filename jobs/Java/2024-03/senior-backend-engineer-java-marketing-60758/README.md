Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time-consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have a choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### Job Description

  * As a Senior Software Engineer within this team, your responsibilities will encompass the design and implementation of new features, as well as the enhancement of existing ones for B2B Marketing campaigns and initiatives.

  * You will initiate the Backend Speciality within Digital Marketing. Your influence on the design and architecture of backend decisions will be significant, collaborating with senior engineering leaders and team leadership to shape the speciality.

### You're probably a match if

  * Comfortable with computer science and engineering fundamentals: concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems

  * You are a self-starter, keen to dig in, learn from others and ask questions.
