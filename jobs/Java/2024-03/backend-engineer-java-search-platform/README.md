### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

**Where and how you can work**

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

**What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

Almost 100% of our users will interact with the Discovery Group of Groups features every time they come to Canva. We are responsible for the AI, Machine Learning, Infrastructure, & User Experience that powers many parts of Canvaâ€™s core product experience.

Our work is the key discovery mechanism to promote and expose Canvaâ€™s content to current and potential users. Without good discovery, users will never know we even have content!

Once youâ€™ve settled in and have a comfortable grasp of the product, environment, and processes, youâ€™ll get to tackle more responsibility and start leveraging your previous experience â€” bringing new insights to the table concerning everything from feature development, process improvement, and product suggestions. Your day to day activities will consist of solution design and hands-on software development â€“ working closely with leads, designers, and product managers to deliver features and functionality to our customers all over the world.

 **Some of the key capabilities we own/contribute include:**

  * Running & deploying our core search & recommender indexes & services
  * Improving our ML rankers across search & recommendations
  * Integrating AI technologies into our ranking & content understanding capabilities
  * Building the amazing search & recommendations experience in the editor & marketplace
  * Building the private search experience - similar to Google Drive
  * Iterating on our generative design product - Magic Design

 **Required Experience & Skills**

  * Commercial experience developing sophisticated web applications
  * Most of our code is in Java, so ideally you will be comfortable using Java.
  * Firmly grounded computer science and engineering fundamentals including concurrency, multithreading, data structures, solution design, architecture, and design patterns
  * Working collaboratively with team members and communicating effectively
  * Good writing and verbal communication skills
  * Previous experience in search is a bonus

 **What's in it for you?**

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally

Please note that interviews are conducted virtually.
