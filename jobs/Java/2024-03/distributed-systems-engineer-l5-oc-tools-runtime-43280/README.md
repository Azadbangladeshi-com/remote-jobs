How do you spark joy in hundreds of millions of people? It starts with a vision - that technology can give voice to stories around the world. In delivering those much-loved stories, Netflix is responsible for a significant portion of global internet traffic.

To steward that responsibility, we work collaboratively with ISPs to deploy Open Connect, Netflixâ€™s Content Delivery Network (CDN), which delivers 100% of Netflix's video traffic. Our teamâ€™s mission is to support that delivery by providing an automation and tooling platform that supports the internal operations and external partnerships needed to provide a fantastic viewing experience for all Netflix members. We are looking for a talented software engineer specializing in infrastructure to join us on that mission.

### The Role

You will be charged with handling impactful availability, scalability, and usability challenges and must self-define optimal ways to configure, manage, and observe our growing Open Connect platform. Our platform is a fundamental building block to our streaming initiatives - providing critical solutions for one of the worldâ€™s largest CDNs and empowering stakeholders to operate the CDN more efficiently and reliably.

### In this position, you will have the opportunity to work in a wide variety of areas, such as:

  * Implementing microservices to enable analytics, insights, discovery, and visualizations.
  * Designing orchestration to manage many thousands of globally distributed appliances and devices
  * Building data models and APIs to help manage and maintain our fleet
  * Understanding the breadth of our multi-tenant platform, creating generalized solutions which can be leveraged across multiple domains - including networking, video, and gaming

### You Are

  * Someone who likes to work hands-on and self-direct in a fast-paced environment that gives you great freedom and responsibility
  * Able to see beyond immediate specifications, can summarize requirements, and architect forward-looking solutions that cross multiple applications
  * Capable of working in a highly-collaborative environment alongside your teammates, engineers, Partner Engagement Managers, project managers, and operations teams
  * Articulate in communicating opportunities for continuous improvements to existing systems with a clear understanding of the impact on the business.
  * Always striving to develop and deploy in measured increments while taking responsibility for the quality of your work.

### Required Skills

  * 5+ years of expertise in Java, or similar object-oriented language, with confidence and experience in debugging and problem-solving skills
  * Deep understanding of cloud architecture and application deployment
  * Ability to build and support highly scalable, robust, and fault-tolerant services
  * Comprehensive knowledge of architecting and maintaining large-scale distributed systems while handling high concurrency
  * Experience designing, implementing, and debugging systems that interact with large-sized data sets
  * Excellent verbal and written communication skills

### Bonus Skills

  * Knowledge of CDN architectures and networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, BGP DNS)
  * Experience with multiple data stores and streaming services such as MySQL, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Kafka, or Redis
  * Familiarity with GraphQL or related graph modeling and querying concepts
  * Hands-on Big Data experience using Hive, Pig, Hadoop, or similar
