### About the role

As komootâ€™s next backend engineer, youâ€™ll be joining a highly-motivated team of tech enthusiasts. Weâ€™re focused on impact, thatâ€™s why we love to find simple and smart solutions to complex problems, and embrace modern technologies to face tough challenges.

As backend engineers, we enable users to explore the outdoors by rapidly creating and operating high quality APIs that serve as a gateway to our features, used by our client apps (Web, Android, iOS, GPS devices, ... ) as well as many third parties such as Garmin, Wahoo, and Bosch.

Join us for an opportunity to collaborate closely with Client Developers, QA, Design, and Data Analytics experts in a cross-functional squad to create innovative features and enhance existing ones.

 **Ready for your next adventure?**

### What you will do

You will work inside one of the cross-functional squads, supporting them on their mission to create impact for our users.

In order to do that you will:

  * Actively contribute to finding technical solutions
  * Proactively give feedback on planning road maps
  * Iterate fast on feedback and changes
  * Design and build our systems in a way so that they run with reasonable costs

We build and operate the APIs to enable our clients (Web, Android, iOS, â€¦) & partners to build the features our users need.

 **You will:**

  * Develop end-to-end solutions including concept, road maps, implementation, testing, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
  * Leverage kotlin and a lot of AWS services in order to efficiently build the solution
  * Collaborate with the clients and your backend partner in the squad to define and build APIs that are performant, as well as easy to understand and integrate
  * Ensure the reliability and availability of the systems through robust testing, monitoring, and maintenance
  * Be part of the on-call rotation we share in the backend team in order to provide our users with available systems

###

### Why you will love it

  * Your work will contribute to helping millions of people enjoy lovely outdoor experiences.
  * Weâ€™ve been a remote-working company since 2017, meaning: We are remote by default, have frameworks and systems in place, and know how to do it well.
  * You can work from wherever you want, be it a beach, the mountains, your house, or anywhere else that lies in any time zone between UTC-1 and UTC+3.
  * We have your costs covered for your co-working space membership or your work-from-home office setup and the latest devices and equipment to do your best work.
  * Youâ€™ll become an essential part of our diverse and international team with colleagues based in 20+ countries across Europe.
  * 38 paid days off (inclusive public holidays) â€“ you are free to take those days whenever it suits you, including a well-deserved winter holiday break.
  * We love seeing people grow. That's why each team member gets â‚¬2,000 and 3 additional days to spend on professional development each year. Classes, conferences, books â€“ your choice!

### Youâ€™ll be successful in this role if you

  * Are highly self-driven, responsible, and keen to learn and improve
  * Are a strong team player and a strong communicator
  * Have 2+ years of professional experience in developing backend systems
  * Have 2+ years of professional experience with managed cloud services, ideally using AWS
  * Have 2+ years of professional experience in a JVM language, ideally kotlin
  * Have 1+ years of professional experience in Python
  * Appreciate the outdoors, nature, and being active
  * Bonus: Have knowledge of GIS

Not sure if you meet all requirements above? Don't sweat it â€“ if you think you're the right person anyway, we'd love to hear from you!
