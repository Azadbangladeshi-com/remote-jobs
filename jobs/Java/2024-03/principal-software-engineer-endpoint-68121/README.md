# [Principal Software Engineer, Endpoint](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/principal-software-engineer-endpoint-68121)  
### ThousandEyes, Inc.  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

### **Who We Are**

The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organisations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered view of the Internet, cloud and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers work together to identify problems before it impacts revenue, damages brand reputation, or halts employee productivity.

In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Ciscoâ€™s Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Ciscoâ€™s growing Observability business.

###  **What Youâ€™ll Do**

This is a rare opportunity to work with one eye on the future, while staying closely rooted in delivering exciting new innovations. You will partner with leaders across ThousandEyes to determine how best to map technology solutions to new market opportunities, and be a role model for the Engineering team in delivery and teamwork. Read on if you like the idea of rolling up your sleeves and shipping code as well as thinking through the more strategic side of product development.

###  **What Weâ€™re Looking For**

We are looking for a product-focused engineering leader to help accelerate our market-leading End User Monitoring business. We are shipping new features and scaling rapidly as we look to dominate this emerging segment. This is an opportunity for you to join a team and product in an early stage of development and help lead it to greater things.

Here are some of the main things we are looking for:

  *  **Deep knowledge of Internet technology**. Youâ€™ll be happy talking TCP, IP, ICMP, UDP and HTTP, and be able to understand deeply how these play together with our technology. Youâ€™ll have a strong sense of how customers configure their networks, and of the challenges and opportunities this brings.
  *  **Strong technical vision**. You can collaborate with and beyond the team to formulate a compelling vision for the product and technology. You have the communication skills to sell it internally and to customers, and to make sure it is represented in the teamâ€™s strategy and roadmap.
  *  **Expert in software development**. This is a hands-on role, so you will be excited by the opportunity to build new things. You will have many examples of successfully delivering complex enterprise software projects. We use technologies such as C++, Java, Kubernetes, Kafka, ElasticSearch and AWS.
  *  **Natural collaborator**. It takes a village to do anything worthwhile, and youâ€™re happy working across Product Management, Product Marketing and Engineering to help shape the future direction of the product line.
  *  **Effective mentor**. You have a passion to up-level the team and those around you. You are open to learning as wellâ€¦nobody is an expert at everything.

Cisco values the perspectives and skills that emerge from employees with diverse backgrounds. That's why Cisco is expanding the boundaries of discovering top talent by not only focusing on candidates with educational degrees and experience but also placing more emphasis on unlocking potential. We believe that everyone has something to offer and that diverse teams are better equipped to solve problems, innovate, and create a positive impact.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification. Research shows that people from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy. We urge you not to prematurely exclude yourself and to apply if you're interested in this work.
