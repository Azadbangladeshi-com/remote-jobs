 **Why Mimecast?**

Weâ€™re fast thinking. We go big to reach our cyberattack-disrupting goals. And we do what we need to protect the world of business from getting important (and potentially compromising) data stolen. We never leave anyone behind. We deliver quickly â€“ and outstandingly. Weâ€™re big on honesty because it makes us better. Weâ€™re empowered by our mission. And if cybercriminals have a good day, we work twice as hard to make the rest of their days a nightmare. Thatâ€™s The Mimecast Way.

And the Mimecast way is also a hybrid-working way. We empower our people to balance their time between home and the office in a way that works best for them, their team, and our stakeholders.

Become a Mimecaster and put corporate data under your protection. Fill our teams with respect. And bring cybercrime-obstructing energy to your work. Be passionate. Be powerful. Be alive with purpose.

 **DEI Statement**

Cybersecurity is a community effort. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re committed to building an inclusive, diverse community that celebrates and welcomes everyone â€“ unless theyâ€™re a cybercriminal, of course.

Weâ€™re proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer, and weâ€™d encourage you to join us whatever your background. We particularly welcome applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups.

We consider everyone equally: your race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, marital status, nationality, or any other protected characteristic wonâ€™t affect your application.

 _Due to certain obligations to our customers, an offer of employment will be subject to your successful completion of applicable background checks, conducted in accordance with local law._
