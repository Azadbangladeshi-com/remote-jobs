We want to redefine the worldâ€™s relationship with money to make it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible.  
  
Today, Cash App has thousands of employees working globally across office and remote locations, with a culture geared toward innovation, collaboration and impact. Weâ€™ve been a distributed team since day one, and many of our roles can be done remotely from the countries where Cash App operates. No matter the location, we tailor our experience to ensure our employees are creative, productive, and happy.
