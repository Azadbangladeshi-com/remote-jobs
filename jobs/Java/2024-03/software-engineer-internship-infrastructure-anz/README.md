 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Weâ€™re looking for the next generation of Canvanauts!

Our Canva internship is a 12-week remote friendly program that runs from the last week of November to the last week of February. There will also be an opportunity to meet your team in person at our flagship campus in Sydney to experience all the magic of Canva in real life. So your summer time is sorted.

As an Intern, you'll have the opportunity to work on real-life projects from start to finish. Along with this, we'll pair you with a Host and assign you a Buddy who will ensure your success every step of the intern journey. Think of them as your own personal intern tour guides.

Youâ€™ll be part of a welcoming and inclusive Early Talent community of peers that take pride in Canvaâ€™s culture of being good humans and empowering each other to achieve our big goals.

  
**Where and how you can work**

Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. If you call New Zealand home, we have our Auckland co-working space too.

But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

 **What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

 **At the moment, this role is focused on:**

  *     * Collaborating with your assigned team to design, develop, test and maintain your intern project
    * Developing and maintaining documentation for software development processes, procedures, and guidelines
    * Developing your craft with some of the most talented engineers
    * Interacting with a wide variety of stakeholders from both inside and outside your team to deliver high-quality work in a fast-paced environment.

 **You're probably a match if**

  * You are currently enrolled and completing your studies between 2025 and mid-2026.
  * You are based in Australia or New Zealand and have working rights. Please note, Canva will not be able to sponsor visas and relocate for Early Talent roles.
  * You are comfortable coding in Python, Go or Java
  * You have knowledge of cloud architecture concepts and/or Infrastructure-as-Code
  * You are familiar with version control concepts (we're using Git!)
  * You are familiar with different testing principles
  * You have excellent Computer Science and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals
  * You have exceptional verbal and written communication skills
  * You have the desire to learn and grow as a technologist in the infrastructure space
  * You are able to commit to the 12-week, full-time summer program from early December 2024 to late February 2025.
