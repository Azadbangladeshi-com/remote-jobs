### Job Description

 _ **Welcome to the coolest job in town!**_

As a software engineer on our dynamic Payments product team, you'll be building innovative solutions that deliver direct value to our customers. We're looking for a Senior Software Engineer who is open to learning new stacks and languages - because we're always on the cutting edge of technology! Java is the language we code on, but we‚Äôre above all polyglot engineers.

You'll be joining us in architecting a brand-new Java solution using the event sourcing pattern and the Axon framework. You understand the importance of building robust, maintainable solutions, and you're not afraid to share your knowledge with your peers. Plus, you'll get to continuously improve our systems - because that's just how we roll.

As an integral part of our team, you'll own our systems with your peers. This means you'll prevent issues (testability), detect issues quickly (observability), act swiftly to mitigate and fix problems in production, and learn from what happened (post mortems). But that's not all! You'll also get to come up with scalable solutions to customer or business problems, maintain and improve systems, and introduce observability in all systems, new and existing.

We value teamwork and collaboration, so you'll be helping to align our team with other teams and stakeholders. And if that's not enough, you'll also get to coach more junior developers, share knowledge within the team, and participate in cross-department tech sessions.

We're looking for someone who isn't afraid to share candid feedback with their team members and other people they interact with - because we believe in constant growth and improvement.

If you're ready to join an exciting, innovative team and make your mark in one of the largest and most historical retailers of the Netherlands, then we want to hear from you!
