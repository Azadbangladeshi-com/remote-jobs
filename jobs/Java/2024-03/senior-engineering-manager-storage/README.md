### About the role:

As a first-class accelerated compute cloud provider, CoreWeave needs first-class cloud storage solutions. The Storage Engineering department is responsible for ensuring that CoreWeaveâ€™s customers and engineering teams have access to the right storage solutions for their needs. Hosted within CoreWeaveâ€™s on-prem data center infrastructure, this departmentâ€™s products span multiple storage protocols (S3, file, block) and storage classes. With some of the biggest names in AI/ML as our customers, CoreWeaveâ€™s pace of innovation and scale represent an engaging set of problems for our engineering teams.

We are seeking a Senior Manager for the Storage Engineering department to help drive the organizational and engineering strategy for CoreWeaveâ€™s cloud storage products and teams. This individual will serve a distributed department of 12-24 individual contributors and engineering managers by minimizing sources of engineer friction, developing and executing a long-term strategy, and fostering a culture of transparency, congruency, and communication. Critically, this individual will need to be adaptable to the pace and maturity of their teams while adding incremental value and maturity through time.

Supported by the Director of Infrastructure Engineering, the selected candidate will have the opportunity to:

  * Identify and minimize sources of friction that impede your teamâ€™s ability to be the best engineering team they can be.
  * Develop and execute a long-term organizational strategy to anticipate both our needs of scale and critical business opportunities.
  * Implement an operational model that drives increasing reliability and performance while scaling at a breakneck pace.
  * Partner with product and engineering leadership to develop product strategy, create roadmaps, and make critical resourcing decisions.
  * Foster a culture of transparency, empathy, blamelessness, accountability, iteration, and data-based decision making.
  * Set the tone for how your teams measure success both in how they support each other and how they enable the rest of CoreWeave.
  * Coordinate with multiple teams to resolve dependencies and achieve project goals.
  * Work with your team to develop and implement processes enabling a reliable, mature practice of platform delivery and development.

**Wondering if youâ€™re a good fit?** **We believe in investing in our people, and value candidates who can bring their own diversified experiences to our teams â€“ even if you aren't a 100% skill or experience match.** **Here are some qualities weâ€™ve found compatible with our team. If a portion of this resonates with you, weâ€™d love to talk.**

  * You have ten or more years of experience in a software or infrastructure engineering industry with six or more years as a dedicated engineering people leader.
  * You have prior experience in the field of cloud storage products and distributed systems engineering and have fluency with the top-three protocols of cloud storage S3 (object), block, and networked filesystem.
  * You love helping people on their journeys to become their best selves and have practice with fostering the development of people leaders.
  * You have experience with marrying product strategy to organizational strategy and have guided a team through a major growth phase such as setting up new teams from scratch.
  * You have experience supporting teams with blended operational and development responsibilities and can drive your domainâ€™s reliability engineering practice.
  * You believe in a bottoms-up style of leadership that focuses on enablement, communication, organization, and inspiration over task management.
  * You have a flexible approach to your leadership practice and can be impactful at differentiated levels of organizational maturity.
