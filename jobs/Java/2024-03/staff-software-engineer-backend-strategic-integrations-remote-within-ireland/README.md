Description

**POS-23605**  

* * *

The Strategic Integrations group at HubSpot provides a first-class integration experience for our customers. There are 12 teams in the SI group and the small but mighty SI Platform team plays a key role in opening up HubSpotâ€™s Developer Ecosystem and empowering HubSpot Partners through the app marketplace.  
  
Staff Software Engineers are highly productive, impactful, and trusted engineers who leverage their skills and knowledge to work autonomously on the most complex projects and set technical direction. Very complex problems can include those that are very broad, very deep, or problems that require spanning across many teams.

As a Staff Software Engineer on SI Platform, you will:

  * Write and ship production code that has meaningful user and business impact
  * Envision, build and analyze new features and tools, each contributing to company growth and revenue
  * Work with a small cross-functional team of engineers, PMs, designers, content designers, and researchers
  * Collaborate with HubSpotters all over the company, whether in engineering, product, design, research, marketing, sales, etc
  * Help HubSpot users meet their goals, via changes youâ€™ve made
  * Implement experiments that give us valuable insights into user behavior and how to improve their experience
  * Get exposure to how HubSpot works as a business

Weâ€™re not just looking for engineers with many years of experience. Instead weâ€™re looking for engineers who also have a track record of unique excellence, leadership, and leveling up those around them.

We are looking for someone to be hands-on. We are not necessarily looking for the typical Architect role, which tends to be less hands-on. That being said, we would be also interested in someone coming from an architectural background as long as they are looking to be more hands-on.

We are looking for someone with demonstrated leadership capability. Good candidates will often have had some time as managers, but their passion is more in technology.

Our product teams are split stack and can build whatever is needed without external dependencies or approval. This process is informed by many feedback loops: usability testing, direct customer interactions, usage tracking, customer support and other stakeholders, so the team decides what ideas to build, how best to implement them and own their ongoing operation.

We work with Java primarily, but experience with specific technologies is secondary to strong programming fundamentals. Check out our engineering blog here to see why HubSpot is different.

What weâ€™d like to see:

  * A passion for clean, scalable code and for product feature development and product innovation.
  * Experience building, releasing, or maintaining public APIs or building developer frameworks would be an advantage
  * Experience working closely with, and contributing ideas and feedback to, product management and designers to help create a solution to exceed our customer's needs.
  * The ability to work collaboratively with the team to solve problems, transfer knowledge, and develop overall product architecture.
  * Coaching and mentorship experience.
