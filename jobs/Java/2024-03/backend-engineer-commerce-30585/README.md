# [Backend Engineer, Commerce](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/backend-engineer-commerce-30585)  
### Whatnot  
#### `üåé CA Los Angeles, California, United States`  

#### üöÄ Whatnot

Whatnot is a livestream shopping platform and marketplace backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator, and CapitalG. We‚Äôre building the future of ecommerce, bringing together community, shopping and entertainment. We are committed to our values, and as a remote-first team, we operate out of hubs within the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, and Germany today.

We‚Äôre innovating in the fast-paced world of live auctions in categories including sports, fashion, video games, and streetwear. The platform couples rigorous seller vetting with a focus on community to create a welcoming space for buyers and sellers to share their passions with others.

And, we‚Äôre growing. Whatnot has been the fastest growing marketplace in the US over the past two years and we‚Äôre hiring forward-thinking problem solvers across all functional areas.

#### üíª Role

  * The Commerce teams work on different aspects of buying and selling on Whatnot. From our auctions and product experience to our seller experience and fulfillment processes, these teams are deeply connected with the foundations of our business and unlock tremendous growth while creating exciting new ways for our users to transact.
  * We are fullstack teams and work across a wide surface of our product to create full-featured end to end user experiences. We rely on all of our team members to have a strong product sense and to deeply understand our users in the work they do.
  * We‚Äôre looking for backend engineers with both a strong systems background and the ability to ship high quality code quickly. You should excel at making the right tradeoffs between building it fast and building it right. We‚Äôll often prototype new ideas quickly and then need to build them for extreme scale while coordinating closely with other teams - the ideal person for this role is an expert at both of these approaches.

  * Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience.
  * Expert at designing and building scalable and maintainable backend systems.
  * Knowledge of multiple programming languages (we primarily use Python, Elixir, JavaScript - knowledge of these in particular not required).
  * Ability to pick up on new technologies very quickly.
  * Excellent product instincts. You first think about users rather than the best technical solution.
  * You are known for shipping products and features lightning-fast.
  * You‚Äôre an excellent problem solver and don‚Äôt need to be told exactly what to do.
  * You can mentor others and prioritize building inclusive, supportive teams.
