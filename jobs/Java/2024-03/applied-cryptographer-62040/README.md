# [Applied Cryptographer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/applied-cryptographer-62040)  
### Quantstamp  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

Quantstamp is looking for an applied cryptographer. Quantstamp often deals with a wide range of cryptographic problems, including reviewing implementations and tackling new theoretical problems using cryptography. For example, Quantstamp regularly receives requests to review code bases which either invoke or implement (custom) cryptography, as part of an audit.

Zero knowledge applications are becoming more common across all ecosystems, and this kind of math will also soon be the basis of several scaling solutions - in particular, zero knowledge rollups. These applications often use a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) proof system, or a zero-knowledge Succinct Transparent Argument of Knowledge (zk-STARK) proof system.

Your day-to-day work will involve doing research about various cryptographic protocols. Some protocols of interest will be those found in the code of our audit clients, others will be protocols of interest for future audits. In particular, in anticipation of audits of, or for, zero-knowledge rollup systems, youâ€™ll be asked to understand various zero-knowledge proof systems. There are a lot of those - we donâ€™t expect mastery in all of them, but mastery of at least one would be ideal.

You may be asked to compare and understand systems youâ€™re not familiar with, and you should be comfortable doing this. Ideally you have a strong theoretical background but can also read and write code (the specific language is not too important). You will talk to other researchers within the company and may be asked to talk to clients directly, in a technical capacity.

**Required**

  * Mastery of at least one zk-SNARK/zk-STARK proof system, or a strong enough technical background to understand one (and this should have some direct connection to cryptography)
  * Ability to code and develop software. You should have experience with at least one major language, like Python, Java, or C; the exact language is not too important. You should be familiar with versioning software (specifically, GitHub), testing, and a familiarity with algorithms and data structures. 
  * Ability to read and interpret academic papers
  * Ability to communicate ideas
  * Partial availability (2-6h) during EST work hours to allow for communication with the team.

**Nice to Have**

  * Familiarity with existing ZK Rollup designs
  * Familiarity with multiple ZK proof systems
  * Strong coding ability
  * Knowledge of software development in Solidity, including testing and various development frameworks like Hardhat.
  * Familiarity with blockchain ecosystems, particularly Ethereum
  * Familiarity with Circom for writing zero knowledge circuits

**Compensation & Perks**

  * Competitive compensation package (commensurate to experience) + performance and referral bonuses.
  * 100% remote and flexible working hours.
  * Work from anywhere in the world.
  * Generous paid time off, including maternity/paternity leave.
  * Retirement/pension plan.
  * Equity.
  * Rent your own desk in a co-working space or work from anywhere at any time.
  * Free gym membership or any virtual alternative of your choice.
  * Learn about the hottest and newest products and trends in the crypto space before they appear on any news outlets.
  * Join all-expenses-paid retreats in exotic/exclusive locations with the team.
