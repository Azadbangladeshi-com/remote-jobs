Everyone has a story to tell. Medium is the place for stories to take shape and take flight. We believe that what you read and write matters, and weâ€™re building a place that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent over clicks and sensationalism. Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month â€” and weâ€™re growing! Our mission is to deepen our collective understanding of the world through the power of writing.

We (like our users) measure the value of Medium not by the number of clicks and views but by the quality of stories being discovered and read every day. Medium is not a pacifier where we hope people kill a couple of free minutes but where they come to deepen their understanding of the topics they care about. We have chosen to explicitly fight back against the attention economy by marrying the best of expert human curators and machine learning to match the very best content with each individual user.
