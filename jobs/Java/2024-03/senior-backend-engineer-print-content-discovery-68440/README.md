### Company Description

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time-consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have a choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### Job Description

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### About this team

At Canva Print, we bring Canva designs into the real world. Weâ€™re an essential part of the Canva user experience with "Publish Anywhere" as our core mission pillar. Print is already a multi-million dollar department within Canva, and offers an incredible opportunity to work at a global scale, whilst still early enough to solve data model complexity with a very talented team of cross-functional specialists. Print is a pivotal part of Canvaâ€™s overall success and revenue. Weâ€™re on a mission to scale up rapidly with your help.

The Canva Print vision is to have a global Marketplace that enables all Canva users to Design and Print anything, anywhere. Anything, anywhere. Our ambition is thousands of products starting with Mugs, Posters, business cards, and menus, that, over time, will include whatever you can imagine, from 3D printing of architectural models or large-scale billboards, or a haute couture fashion line. Print is accessible no matter where you are, with a strong focus on ethical and environmentally friendly practices, such as the One Print One Tree initiative.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Building scalable features for our customers

  * Building tools and frameworks that help us rapidly and reliably conduct experiments across different parts of the Canva app

  * Design, develop and deploy solutions and hands-on software development â€“ working closely with leads, designers, and product managers to deliver features and experiments to our customers worldwide

  * Work collaboratively and consult with leads, product managers, and engineers across teams at Canva to unblock front-end works that help your group deliver features and experiments to our customers worldwide

  * Communicate effectively with Product Managers and Engineers across Canva when developing a solution; seek and incorporate diverse perspectives to address complex issues.

### You're probably a match if

  * You are at home working in our core technology environment - our core stack is Java backed by both relational and NoSQL databases as appropriate

  * You are firmly grounded in computer science and engineering fundamentals including concurrency, multithreading, data structures, solution design, architecture, and design patterns

  * You enjoy working collaboratively with team members and communicating effectively

  * You can write performant, scalable reusable components, including appropriate testing

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and support you personally
