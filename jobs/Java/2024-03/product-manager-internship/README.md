### About CourseCareers

Do you want to leave your mark on the world?

The college system has lied to us and cheated us. We've gone to war with the system and are on the front line fighting back.

No more will students be forced into debt just to be able to have access to a decent career that doesn't even utilize their education. Weâ€™re the modern way people start careers. We help everyone ranging from 18-year-olds using our program as a college alternative to people switching their careers later in life.

Within 10 years, we're going to bankrupt nearly every college in the US, saving millions from debt. More importantly, we're unlocking all of human potential in our economy.

Become a vigilante, and be a part of history!
