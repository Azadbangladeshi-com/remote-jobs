### About CourseCareers

Do you want to leave your mark on the world?

The college system has become corrupt, tricking millions of people into debt by selling false promises. We've gone to war with the system and are on the front line fighting back.

No more will students be forced into debt just to have access to a decent career that doesn't even utilize their education. Weâ€™re the modern way people start careers. We help everyone ranging from 18-year-olds using our program as a college alternative to people switching careers later in life.

Within 10 years, we will bankrupt nearly every college in the US, saving millions from debt. More importantly, we're unlocking the world's potential and changing the pace of human progress.

### About the Role

The mission of this Chief of Staff role is to help CourseCareers grow faster by increasing the CEO's leverage.

This includes everything from team retreat planning to complex problem-solving, research, data analysis, cross-functional communication, leading new initiatives, assisting in decision-making, and anything else needed to scale a business at a breakneck pace. This would be a 70% chief operating officer and 30% executive assistant type of role.

This Chief of Staff role will be the CEO's shadow, working extremely closely with him to increase his effectiveness however possible. By being in this role, you'll be the CEO's right hand as we scale the company revenue 10x in 2024. Kind of like a mini-me, you'll learn and touch every part of building a profitable, fast-growing technology company.

This is the ideal role for someone who wants to be pushed to their limits and put their career in the fast lane.

  * Act as a connector, fostering collaboration and communication among the executive team.

  * Support the CEO in evaluating and achieving key performance indicators.

  * Do anything and everything to make the CEO more effective, allowing CourseCareers to more quickly replace the college system. 

### What You'll Need

  * Learning and figuring things out very quickly is the most important qualification for success.

### Compensation
