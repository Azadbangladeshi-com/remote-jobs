Now, with more than 225 million people around the world using our products each month, weâ€™re shaping the next 25 years of technology and helping to reclaim an internet built for people, not companies.

Along with 60,000+ volunteer contributors and collaborators all over the world, Mozillians design, build and distribute open-source software that enables people to enjoy the internet on their terms.

**What is a Staff Engineer at Mozilla?**

A Staff Engineer is the next level from a Senior Engineer. At Mozilla this role can vary but typically a Staff Engineer is a domain expert who leads others within a single team to tackle multi-month projects. Tasks that may be initially ambiguous or require significant planning and require them to influence or direct the work of several engineers. They sequence deliverables and manage risks in their team's projects, provide feedback on our strategy and goals affecting the team, and turn our strategy into action for their team members. Staff Engineers mentor others by stewarding some responsibilities to more junior and senior engineers so they can take on new ones. They collaborate with management on building team consensus and providing direction. Staff Engineers identify gaps and opportunities for improvement to enable a culture of inclusion and allyship, at all levels of the organization.
