##  
**Company:**

Qualcomm International, Inc. Australia Branch Office

##  **Job Area:**

Engineering Group, Engineering Group > Software Engineering

 _ **General Summary:**_

Qualcomm is looking for talented and enthusiastic engineers with strong interests in OS, kernel and computer architecture. The Qualcomm Sydney Hypervisor team is world-leading, enabling virtualisation across multiple chipset products for mobile, automotive and IoT. The team is responsible for the hypervisor software layer that plays a key role in platform security and performance.

Qualcomm is industry leading in its adoption of virtualisation technology in its Snapdragon mobile products. The team has built the open-source Gunyah hypervisor and continues to develop innovative features, enhancements, and use-cases.

As a software engineer at Qualcomm, you will help develop hypervisor, SMMU and related software for the latest cutting-edge ARM processors, which is embedded in a wide range of chipset products and used by many OEMs in millions of devices. The role will include interfacing with large software stacks such as Bootloaders, Linux and TrustZone â€“ which provides the opportunity to interact with teams around the world.

Gunyah is an open-source Type-1 hypervisor, it is independent of any high-level OS kernel and runs in a higher CPU privilege level. It does not depend on any lower-privileged OS kernel/code for its core functionality. This increases its security and can support a much smaller trusted computing base.
