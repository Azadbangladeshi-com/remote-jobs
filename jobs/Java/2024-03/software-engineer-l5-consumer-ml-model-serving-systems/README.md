Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service, with over 230 million paid members in over 190 countries, enjoying TV series, feature films, and games across numerous genres and languages. Members can watch or play as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internet-connected screen.

  

Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence powers the majority of the consumer experience, including content discovery and personalization, identifying and attracting new members to our product, optimizing our payment processing, and many more.

  

**The Opportunity**

  

The Consumer ML Model Serving team provides the platform for computation, inference, and serving on which nearly all our consumer-facing ML/AI applications are built. If youâ€™ve seen it, we probably served it. We provide all the building blocks required to serve ML at scale, including a real-time model serving platform, an event-driven model and feature compute framework, a compute orchestration engine, and many more.

  

We are looking for a strong technical lead to own and develop our long-term vision. Our systems power some of the most business-critical models at Netflix, and we need you to take our ML/AI initiatives to the next level. You will play a highly cross-functional role, partnering with other engineers, product managers, machine learning engineers, and data/research scientists.

  

If you have a passion for building scalable, robust systems, are interested in pushing the envelope in applied ML algorithms, and enjoy seeing a direct line between your work and what our customers see on their screens, then we want to talk to you.

  

### You may enjoy working with us if you are:

  * Eager to learn about new domains and ship high-quality, well-tested code.
  * Able to produce generic and optimal solutions while balancing near-term needs.
  * Excited to work in a multidisciplinary environment (engineering, algorithms, data engineering/science, product experimentation).
  * Comfortable working in a majority-remote team with partners distributed across (US) geographies & time zones.
  * Willing to take broad ownership of team responsibilities (building roadmaps, scoping, task breakdowns, etc.) 

### We would especially love to work with you if have experience with:

  * Building high-traffic, real-time distributed systems and ML infrastructure. 
  * Supporting large-scale ML models with a direct impact on what customers see. 
  * Translating the requirements of research scientists into generic platform offerings. 
  * Delivering systems requiring high availability, throughput, and performance.
  * Navigating highly ambiguous environments. 
  * Taking on and executing zero-to-one projects.
  * Leading projects with 3-4 other engineers.
  * Building applications in an object-oriented programming language. (We work primarily with Java, and while prior Java experience is not required to interview, you will be expected to become proficient on the job.) 
  * DevOps for large applications, including performance tuning, optimization, deployment management, and capacity planning. 
  * Public cloud like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

### â€¦and if:

  * You are a proactive, effective communicator and have a strong bias towards action.
  * You have a BS/MS in Computer Science, Applied Math, Engineering, or a related field.
