Principal Software Engineer

Your opportunity

At New Relic, we provide our customers real-time insights, so they can innovate faster. Our software delivers insightful observability tools across different technologies and distributed systems, enabling software engineering teams to identify, understand, and tackle issues, analyze performance, and optimize their software and infrastructure.

  

The Streaming Ingest Platform group at New Relic is looking for an experienced Principal Software Architect to join our teams. We seek someone who is passionate about delivering software solutions that involve CDN edge, secure endpoints, high throughput streaming data ingest, highly available and reliability of 99.95% in a multi cloud environment which is designed to be secure, modular and fault-tolerant.

  

The role involves being highly engaged, leading the vision and strategy for the Streaming Ingest Platform, solving for the short term while planning for our next best platform, focusing on performance, security, global expansion, regional resilience, reliability, scalability, and cost efficiency.

  

We encourage asynchronous communication and independence, but highly value knowing what is more appropriate for synchronous communications and striking a balance between the two. We value building strong human relationships between team members during our ceremonies and value in person meet ups when possible.

What you'll do

  * Architect, design, and implement a scalable and highly available Streaming Ingest Platform based on Kubernetes, mostly Java with some java script, Go, Rust, React, PostgreSQL and Redis. Kafka is a big part of how our systems communicate. Chronicle Queue keeps our ingest engine performant and reliable. 
  * Own, drive vision and strategy for the Cloud Platform and provide architectural guidance for security, reliability, scalability, resilience, performance, and cost optimization.
  * Partner closely with your engineering leader and product manager to help drive the technical roadmaps, balancing new features, service reliability, and technical debt reduction.
  * Collaborate with leadership, product management, and engineering to align priorities and plans. 
  * Facilitate technical communication across teams, organizations, and leadership. Concise communications with the ability to explain technically deep concepts very clearly through diagrams and technical documentation is a must.
  * Do run-ahead research and build prototypes for new features or to optimize existing systems for performance or cost.
  * Identify and lead resolution for any cross-team and cross-org technical issues, working with other architects and engineering leaders as needed.
  * Coach and mentor the teams you collaborate with and develop balanced architecture, and maintainable solutions that leave teams healthier than before and follow industry trends.
  * Serve as the connective tissue between teams and organizations for technical matters.
  * Promote an inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives.

This role requires

  * 10+ years experience in building and managing distributed systems in the cloud with a passion for solving complex distributed system challenges.
  * 10+ years in Java and familiarity with languages like Go, Rust, JavaScript, React. 
  * BS/BA degree required in Computer Science or Engineering or equivalent work experience.
  * Strong experience in developing, maintaining and migrating workloads on major public cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
  * Deep understanding of security, reliability, scalability, availability, performance and cost-effectiveness of distributed systems on public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
  * Strong experience with event-driven architecture and stream processing applications.
  * Ability to do run-ahead research and build prototypes for new features or to optimize existing systems for performance or costs.
  * Understanding of edge workers functionality with CDN providers such as Cloudflare, Fastly and CloudFront.
  * Understanding of Network Architecture
  * Effective at driving transformational projects, and unifying technical teams around a common architecture.
  * Proven track record of setting and achieving ambitious goals, guided by metrics.
  * Excellent communication skills, capable of engaging both technical and executive audiences.
  * Comfortable working across time zones(IN\US\EU time zones) in a fast-paced setting.
  * Knowledgeable in Agile and other software development methodologies.

Bonus points if you have

  * Hands-on experience with Kafka, Flink, Spark, or Pulsar
  * Experience designing systems that integrate 3rd party code and components
  * Experience with Kafka and streaming data processing
