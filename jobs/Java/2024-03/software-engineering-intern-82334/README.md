**About Us**

Ada is a rapidly growing company in a thriving AI ecosystem. We optimize our communication, collaboration, and work ethic for the digital world instead of in-person. We are building the workplace of the future to build the customer experience of the future. With flexible working hours, together we'll determine a schedule that fits your style and the requirements of your role. We are backed by world-class investors, including Spark, Accel, FirstMark, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Version One. We provide our employees with competitive compensation, great health benefits, and ownership in our company.

We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in societyâ€”including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities, even if you donâ€™t meet every qualification we listed, because members of marginalized communities are less likely to apply if they donâ€™t meet every qualification. We believe that without you, we cannot progress. At Ada, we donâ€™t stand for tokenism. We stand for representation.

Our values are our fundamental driving forces for decision-making. They are the heart of what we stand for and are critical to our next phase of growth. You can learn more about our values and Adaâ€™s founding story on our Careers page.

Everyone has their own unique talents. Even if you donâ€™t meet 100% of the above qualifications, tell us why youâ€™d be a great fit for this role in your application.
