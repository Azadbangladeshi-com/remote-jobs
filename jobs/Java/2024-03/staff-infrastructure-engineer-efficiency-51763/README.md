### **Who we are**

###  **About Stripe**

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

###  **About the team**

Stripeâ€™s infrastructure powers businesses all over the world. We process payments, run marketplaces, detect fraud, help entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, build world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more.

As an engineer on the Efficiency team, youâ€™ll be a part of a high performing team to optimize our cloud utilization and overall performance of our systems and services. Youâ€™ll work cross functionally to analyze, attribute, understand and forecast our long term cloud infrastructure usage and develop cost optimization strategies. This team will help optimize the systems that power our products; and identify bottlenecks in our product design that lead to inefficiencies.

### What youâ€™ll do

We are seeking an experienced technical leader who will join our team to devise, drive and practice a culture of efficiency across Stripe. In this role, you will work closely with engineering managers, senior engineers, and cross-functional partners to design the technical architecture of the product to enable scale, interoperability and an amazing user experience. Weâ€™re looking for people with strong passion for performance, and efficiency with an inquisitive mindset. You should be comfortable to delve into, investigate, and discover opportunities for improving resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk) across the fleet, and identify architectural improvements to drive systemic efficiency.

Our work has an immediate and measurable impact on the effectiveness and happiness of Stripe engineers. There is a lot of work to do to make Stripeâ€™s platforms more efficient without sacrificing performance, latency, or reliability and weâ€™d love for you to be part of it.

### Responsibilities

  * Design, build, and maintain instrumentation, data pipelines to support data driven decision making
  * Plan for and optimize the growth of Stripe infrastructure
  * Work across teams at Stripe to help define and implement efficiency projects
  * Conduct deep-dives on product design and architecture, in collaboration with various Engineering teams, driving cost optimization initiatives and having a direct impact on product development
  * Optimize code, configuration, and systems to achieve improved utilization and performance
  * Manage the technical leadership, execution, and roadmap for the Efficiency tools and solutions. 
  * Lead by example by designing and implementing critical platforms that enable seamless interoperability across the Efficiency suite of products.
  * Partner closely with engineering, product, and design leadership to define our product strategy and user experience.
  * Establish best practices, frameworks, and repeatable processes that enable the team to execute effectively.
  * Foster a culture of learning and data-driven decision making on the team and the broader organization.
  * Mentor and support the growth of engineers at different levels in their careers.

### **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### Minimum requirements

  *     * At least 15 years of engineering experience or equivalent combined work experience demonstrating relevant domain expertise
    * Hands-on experience with relevant programming languages and big data technologies (e.g., Python, Scala, Java, Airflow, Hadoop, Spark)
    * Experience working with cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
    * Experience developing, maintaining and debugging large-scale distributed systems (streaming, batch, compute, storage) built with open source tools
    * Experience with performance and resource utilization monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) in distributed environments
    * Comfortable breaking down large, complex systems and identifying optimization opportunities.
    * Experience building infrastructure as a product centered around usersâ€™ needs
    * Proven experience leading company-wide initiatives or influencing tech roadmap planning and execution.
    * You work very well cross-functionally, and are able to think rigorously and make hard decisions and tradeoffs.
    * You have great product taste and a track record of taking complex problems and solving them elegantly.
    * You are capable of working in ambiguous fast-moving environments and have a curiosity to learn the domain to a deep level.
