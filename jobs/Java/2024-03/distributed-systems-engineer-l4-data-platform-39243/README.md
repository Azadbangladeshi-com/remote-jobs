### Spotlight on Data Infrastructure Teams:

 **Data Platform Infrastructure |** Learn More

The Data Platform Infrastructure team acts as a platform for our own data platforms. Our shared infrastructure and tooling enable Netflix to quickly innovate on providing state-of-the-art data and analytics systems to the rest of the company without building bespoke scaffolding for each new system. To do this, we create high-leverage infrastructure, control, and deployment systems that are fine-tuned for the needs of running our data systems at scale; uniquely, many of our tools and systems are written in Python, so this is a great team to consider if you enjoy working in a variety of languages.

 **Data Discovery and Metadata Platform** **|** Learn More

This team is responsible for the broader data discovery and metadata strategy at Netflix. We aim to provide visibility to the taxonomy and business context of all Netflix datasets (including video assets, unstructured logs, etc). We have built a **Netflix-wide data catalog** to capture and infer business metadata across all datasets at Netflix. We own the **Distributed Search and Lineage Infrastructure** to efficiently discover data and track data movement across different data stores. We have built a customizable **data detection framework** that samples, detects, and reports violations across all datasets which gives us holistic insights into the risk profiles and quality of our data. We also provide an extensible **policy engine framework** that allows our stakeholders to customize data policy rules for all datasets.

 **Realtime Data Engines** **|** Learn More

Offers low-level building blocks for the transport and processing of realtime data. For data transport we offer Kafka; for data processing we offer Flink and Mantis. Responsibilities include development of the control plane, compute resource management, reliability and availability of the data. Realtime data is critical across many business units of Netflix including Streaming, Gaming, Finance and Machine Learning platforms.

 **Database Access Platform** **|** Learn More

The Database Access Platform team builds and operates a flexible query gateway that facilitates data abstractions to operate at sub-millisecond latencies while allowing Netflix microservices to more easily store, consume, and manage their data. This team holds a substantial responsibility in enabling Netflix microservices to satisfy their ever-growing and evolving data needs.

 **Data Analytics and AI Tools |** Learn More

The Data Analytics and AI Tools team offers a cloud-based infrastructure for crafting and sharing Notebooks and Python APIs that provide programmatic access to our Data Platform. Our work also involves the development and maintenance of abstractions that connect with advanced AI tools, including both in-house and third-party machine learning models.
