Description

**About the Company**

Gemini is a global crypto and Web3 platform founded by Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss in 2014. Gemini offers a wide range of crypto products and services for individuals and institutions in over 70 countries.

Crypto is about giving you greater choice, independence, and opportunity. We are here to help you on your journey. We build crypto products that are simple, elegant, and secure. Whether you are an individual or an institution, we help you buy, sell, and store your bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

At Gemini, our mission is to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.

_In the United States, we have a flexible hybrid work policy for employees who live within 30 miles of our office headquartered in New York City. Employees within the New York Metropolitan area are expected to work from the NYC office twice a week, unless there is a job-specific requirement to be in the office every workday. Employees outside of this area are considered part of our remote-first workforce. We believe our hybrid approach for those near our NYC office increases productivity through more in-person collaboration where possible._

  * The ability to adapt and handle multiple competing priorities in collaboration with peers.
