### Benefits

Salary: Up to Â£80,000 per annum, depending on experience.

Hours of work are 35 hours per week - including a 2pm finish on a Friday!

The position is a fully remote role, but we do enjoy social events a few times a year which you can attend (but aren't mandatory!).

Fruugo is a great place to work and we are proud of our friendly, supportive and dynamic culture which treats everyone with respect and embraces diversity. We have some excellent benefits, including Company pension, employee discount, Employee Referral Programme, and a fantastic Employee Assistance Programme, offering wellness benefits to employees and their immediate family.
