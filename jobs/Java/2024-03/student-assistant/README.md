Project Six:  
  
Title: Network Performance Prediction with Foundation Models  
  
Term: Summer 2024  
  
Required skills:  
  
Expert with foundation modeling  
Willing to learn about network performance prediction  
Proficient in written communication  
Proficient in Python programming  
  
Abstract:  
  
A research group led by Professor Arpit Gupta from UCSB has been interacting with ESnet management on exploring topics of automating some routine operations of ESnet. In particular, a summer project has been established to understand the possibility of applying the foundation model the UCSB team has developed for network traffic prediction. This task might provide helpful information for managing  
  
expected high volumes of traffic on some backbone links operated by ESnet. The advantage of the foundation models is that they could systematically reduce the dependency on labeled data that are hard to  
  
come by for use cases involving unusually large volumes of traffic on a link. The UCSB team has demonstrated successful use cases involving a campus network, we are interested in validating the approach for network backbone operated by ESnet.  
  
Project Seven  
  
Title: Machine Learning for Identification of REE-CM Hot Zones  
  
Term: Summer 2024  
  
Required skills:  
  
Expert with machine learning tools  
Willing to learn about classification problems involving gamma-ray detection data  
Proficient in written communication  
Proficient in Python programming  
  
Abstract:  
  
Characterization of Rare Earth Elements and Critical Minerals (REE-CM) in unconventional and secondary sources is a complex task that needs to overcome the challenges of detecting low and variable concentrations and the uniqueness of every source material deposit in terms of composition, host  
  
material, and disposal environment. Like in traditional mineral prospecting, delineation of the REE-CM ‚Äúhot zones‚Äù is critical for assessing the economic viability of these sources. Here, a hot zone is defined as a spatially delineated volume of high REE-CM concentrations within the tailing deposits.  
  
We propose a machine learning (ML)-aided multi-physics approach for rapid identification and characterization of REE-CM hot zones in mine tailings for efficient recovery with a focus on coal and sulfide mine tailings and other processing or utilization byproducts, such as fly ash and refuse deposits.  
  
This proposed multi-physics approach integrates a range of advanced and novel geophysical, radiological, and optical technologies deployed on aerial and surface platforms suitable for REE-CM prospecting. Aided by multiple existing and emerging core and lab analytical technologies, this integrated  
  
approach provides a cross-scale capability from whole tailing REE-CM hot zone identification down to mineralogical and REE-CM characterization and quantification. Advanced ML capabilities are key to integrating these multi-physics datasets for identifying hot zones and optimizing sensing technology deployment. Feature engineering ML joined with federated learning and transfer learning will be used for data organization, feature extraction, and privacy protection.
