### Whatâ€™s it all about?

As a Principal Engineer, you will occupy a key strategic role that requires extensive industry experience and a strong understanding of both business and technical architecture. Reporting directly into the VP of Principal Engineering (PE), you will provide support to the FinCrime & Onboarding domains while leading initiatives that shape the wider business and technical direction over multiple years. The role is guided by the PE mission to amplify business impact, steward our technology strategy, and cultivate a purpose-driven engineering culture. This is a leadership-first role where how you operate matters just as much as what you deliver.

### What we expect of you:

  * Steer complex technical and business programmes, maintaining a deep and holistic understanding of short term and strategic goals

  * Coach and mentor aspiring engineers and spearhead growth and development initiatives across the technology function

  * Ensure the domains you support have a clear and evolutionary architectural direction, bringing in wider context and ensuring cohesion with other teams

  * Contribute, embed and educate others on business and technical architecture excellence, alongside the rest of the PE team, empowering others to deliver better outcomes

  * Work closely with senior leadership to develop short- and long-term roadmaps, build scenario models and support investment cases for a wide range of stakeholders

  * Use critical thinking to lean into problems that others find daunting, questioning the status quo and over time, venture beyond your role to amplify impact

  * Proactively stay abreast of innovation opportunities within your domains, undertaking exploratory work alongside non-technical stakeholders in the compliance, regulatory and operations functions, and colleagues within the wider Visa group

  * Exemplify the Visa values and inspire others with a proactive, can-do attitude balanced with loosely held, strong opinions

### Principal Engineers are not:

  * Solution Architects â€“ PEs stay close to the engine room, guiding and empowering others to independently deliver better outcomes and make aligned decisions. PEs use data and guardrails to track progress and course correct as needed.

  * Enterprise Architects â€“ PEs are expected to ride the architectâ€™s elevator and work across our entire architecture framework, from strategic direction and business architecture through to technical architecture and supporting programme deliverables.

This is a remote position. A remote position does not require job duties be performed within proximity of a Visa office location. Remote positions may be required to be present at a Visa office with scheduled notice.

### Qualifications

### What weâ€™re after:

  * Proven experience in FinCrime which may encompass Fraud, AML, Risk Management, KYx or Regulatory Compliance, ideally within a global (multi-region) landscape
  * Outstanding leadership skills in particular communication, broad influence and operating with integrity, empathy and humility
  * Solid track record with working with third-party vendors to integrate new capabilities, run due diligence, establish integration patterns, and build long-term partnerships.
  * Demonstrable experience in designing and steering multi-year strategic initiatives across technical, product and business functions
  * Broad understanding of business (enterprise) architecture and distributed, cloud-based technical architectures, including how the 2 intersect
  * Proven expert in trading off ilities based on business/technical and short/long term drivers
  * Examples of driving of architectural excellence through influence not accountability
  * Keen interest in influencing the financial services, regulatory, and technology sectors beyond the immediate role such as conferences, meetings and working groups

### A bonus if you have experience with:

  * B2B products within banks, financial services or FinTech organisations
  * Environments requiring a very high bar for InfoSec and operational resiliency
  * Customer Experience & UI design in relation to Onboarding
  * Technical specifics such as event-driven, microservice architectures. Capability, business flow and event modelling. Kafka, Kubernetes, Java, AWS and APIs-as-a-Product
