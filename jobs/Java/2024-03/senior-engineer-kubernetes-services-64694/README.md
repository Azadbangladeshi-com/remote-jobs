### About the role:

The Kubernetes Services Team ensures the reliability, scalability, and usability of the core application management platform within CoreWeave. This team is responsible for the services, processes and tooling that enable internal consumers to install, upgrade, and manage the complete lifecycle of applications within CoreWeaveâ€™s Kubernetes-native infrastructure platform. Members of this team will be challenged to combine the tools and patterns of the modern Kubernetes ecosystem with learnings gained from experiences with CI/CD, distributed systems orchestration, traffic shaping, progressive rollouts, application packaging, channel management, and SRE fundamentals to develop CoreWeaveâ€™s next-generation solution for internal service delivery.

We are seeking a Senior Engineer to join the Kubernetes Services Team and help us develop and advance the tools and processes used to deliver internal services reliably, at-scale, and with minimal engineer friction. This individual will join a team of 6-8 mixed-skill engineers and have the opportunity to work on the full gamut of rewarding challenges that come with the business of building a cloud in a communicative, supportive, and high-performing environment. As a member of the Kubernetes Services Team, you would have the opportunity to:

  * Design and implement solutions to fascinating problems of scale for orchestrating the services that run one of the most exciting clouds in the world, today.
  * Integrate the right mix of innovative and battle-hardened tools and practices of the Kubernetes service delivery ecosystem into how CoreWeave deploys and manages services at scale.
  * Coordinate closely with other teams in the Kubernetes Engineering division and throughout CoreWeave to drive adoption of best practices.
  * Create custom Kubernetes interfaces, gateways, and orchestrators such as ArgoCD to enable declarative, reliable delivery of applications at scale.
  * Improve the performance, security, and reliability of our Kubernetes products and participate in the Kubernetes Services on-call rotation.
  * Develop dashboards, alerts, and insights into the customer experience using Grafana-ecosystem tools such as Mimir and Loki.
  * Grow, change, invest in your teammates, be invested-in, share your ideas, listen to others, be curious, have fun, and, above all, be yourself.

**Wondering if youâ€™re a good fit?** **We believe in investing in our people, and value candidates who can bring their own diversified experiences to our teams â€“ even if you aren't a 100% skill or experience match.** **Here are some qualities weâ€™ve found compatible with our team. If a portion of this resonates with you, weâ€™d love to talk.**

  * You have four or more years of experience in a software or infrastructure engineering industry
  * You have experience operating services in production and at scale.
  * Youâ€™re comfortable with the idea of using Go as your primary programming language.
  * You have some experience using Kubernetes with a conceptual understanding of its major components and/or have operated Kubernetes clusters with some form of automation.
  * You know your way around a Linux distro, shell scripting, and/or the Linux storage and networking stacks.
  * Youâ€™re interested in reliability engineering concepts such as the different types of testing, progressive deployments, error budgets, the role observability, and fault-tolerant design.
  * You can transform problems in elastic architectures, decompose them into achievable tasks, and socialize both to your teammates.
  * Youâ€™re excited about being part of a team of diverse perspectives and backgrounds that believe in tackling challenges, growing hand in hand, and winning together.
