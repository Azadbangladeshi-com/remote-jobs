As a Staff ML/AI Security Researcher, you will be responsible for security auditing of machine learning and AI, including large language models (LLMs), within the ServiceNow platform, and our products, including design and architecture review and implementation review and testing.

  * Performing tailored investigations to identify and report on areas and sources of risk 

  * Devising actionable, and potentially novel, tailored remediations and recommendations focused on reducing risk 

  * Work with engineering teams to support remediation efforts and platform security enhancements 

  * Proactively research attack vectors against ML and AI that may affect ServiceNow 

  * Publish research demonstrating technical security expertise, such as through academic papers, blog posts, and whitepapers 

### Qualifications

  * Experience in adversarial machine learning, including data poisoning, prompt injection, and model extraction 

  * 3-4 years of experience of application security auditing including code review and threat modeling 

  * Strong understanding of common application security vulnerability and mitigating controls 

  * Experience in security auditing and code review of Java and Python 

  * A passion for security, privacy, and problem solving 

  * Proven track record of delivering high-quality research outputs and publication of research in the field of security at top-tier venues 

  * Ability to deliver technical reports and communicate technical concepts to both non-technical business users, as well as technical stakeholders 

  * Strong verbal communication skills with an emphasis on application remediation processes 

  * Ability to generate working proof-of-concept exploits for theoretical attacks 

  * Fluency in reading academic papers on machine learning and AI 

  * Degree in computer science or engineering, artificial intelligence, mathematics, statistics, or informatics, or equivalent work experience 

**Preferred Qualifications:**

  * Demonstrated interest in ML/AI security and/or privacy such as evidenced by work in differential privacy or secure multiparty computation
