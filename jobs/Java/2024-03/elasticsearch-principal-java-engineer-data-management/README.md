Do you want to work on distributed search and analytics software which impacts the lives of millions of people? Weâ€™re not interested in your previous job title. Instead, we are looking for bright people with a deep knowledge of Java, algorithms, and concurrency and who love to take on new challenges.

Right now, we are on the lookout for a talented Java Engineer to join our Elasticsearch team. You will be working on areas of Elasticsearch that primarily deal with ingesting large volumes of data and the management of that data once indexed. For example, Index Lifecycle Management, Data Streams, and the Ingest Pipelines are all part of data management. You can work fully remote from your home or (almost) anywhere in the world.

### What you will be doing:

  * Evolving and creating new features in Elasticsearch
  * Designing and implementing new horizontally-scalable features and APIs in Elasticsearch
  * Understanding and contributing to surrounding layers such as replication and search
  * Optimizing internal data structures used within Elasticsearch 
  * Tackling difficult issues, including performance or concurrency issues, and proposing solutions
  * Collaborating in the open with the Elasticsearch team, Elastic Stack users, and other supporting open source projects
  * Partnering with our support engineers on the harder problems

### What you bring along:

  * You are highly proficient in Java, conversant in the standard library of data structures and concurrency constructs, as well as newer features like lambdas.
  * Experience troubleshooting complex issues. 
  * A high level of autonomy. The distributed nature of the company offers freedom to work when and how you see fit, but also requires team members to work independently, and reach out for help when stuck.
  * Experience working with large volumes of data in noSQL datastore(s). 

### Bonus points:

  * Experience running Elasticsearch at scale. 
  * Experience with systems administration or DevOps, with Kubernetes experience a definite bonus.
  * Experience with complex Gradle builds.
  * Maintaining open source libraries.

### Additional Information - We Take Care of Our People

As a distributed company, diversity drives our identity. Whether youâ€™re looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life. Your age is only a number. It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.

We strive to have parity of benefits across regions and while regulations differ from place to place, we believe taking care of our people is the right thing to do.

  * Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary
  * Health coverage for you and your family in many locations
  * Ability to craft your calendar with flexible locations and schedules for many roles
  * Generous number of vacation days each year
  * Double your charitable giving - We match up to $1500 (or local currency equivalent)
  * Up to 40 hours each year to use toward volunteer projects you love
  * Embracing parenthood with minimum of 16 weeks of parental leave
