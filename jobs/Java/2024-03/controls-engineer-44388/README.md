### About Better Origin

Our food chain is broken - the system that can barely feed 7 billion people will not feed 10 billion weâ€™re expected to reach by 2050. And while it's hard to imagine that things could be different, they have to be.

At Better Origin, our mission is to fix the broken food chain. We are inspired by nature and how it deals with waste, with nutrients always flowing in a circular system.

Our solution use insects - nature's best up cyclers - to transform food waste into a range of innovative products, from animal feed to pet food. With the help of AI and robotics the larvae find their place back into the food chain, reducing food waste and emissions, **making circular economy possible**.

### Why join us?

Weâ€™re backed by world-class investors at Balderton Capital, Fly Ventures and Metavallon VC. We're working with supermarkets and food producers to roll out our technology in the UK and the EU. In 2021, we signed a contract with Morrisons to convert their fruit and veg waste and create a carbon neutral egg line.

Following our $16m Series A round raised to support technology and team scaleup, we are looking to hire the best people that make Better Origin a great place to work.

We are very proud of our values and want to attract those who feel motivated by them as much as we are. Some of our key values include:

  1. Customer obsession
