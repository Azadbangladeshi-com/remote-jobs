### **What Youâ€™ll Do:**

As an Astrodynamics Engineer II, you will develop and build upon algorithms and prototypes and apply astrodynamics techniques to multi-source information, with an emphasis on orbit determination applications. You will integrate astrodynamics algorithms and libraries into Slingshot software capabilities and products and engage in astrodynamics analysis, research, and development. You will engage in problem solving as it relates to space systems applications, postulating candidate solutions, and testing hypotheses through simulation in software. You may also support customer discovery and engagement activities, and assist in shaping and advancing Slingshot products as required by your role within the team.

### Position Responsibilities:

  * Execute all position responsibilities in alignment with Slingshotâ€™s core values, mission, and purpose
  * Apply astrodynamics and statistical orbit determination capabilities to real-world onboard and ground-based sensor data, analyze results, commence studies, incorporate advanced astrodynamics and orbit determination techniques, and work with customers to mitigate data issues and deliver high-quality solutions.
  * Assist in the identification and subsequent execution of science initiatives in support of product and/or research and development
  * Present findings on assigned science initiatives to the team during regularly scheduled meetings
  * Develop and contribute, individually or in assigned teams, algorithms and related documentation as required to support team activities and product roadmap execution
  * Provide subject matter expertise to Engineering and Product Design teams in your assigned functional role
  * Participate as a subject matter expert during customer engagements and demonstrations, and provide regular updates to Science leadership on the outcome of those engagements
  * Architect candidate solutions based on customer feedback, identify required technical developments needed to meet customer requirements, and present findings to Science leadership for final selection and resourcing decisions
  * Assist Science leadership in the development of content in support of papers, proposals, and product documentation and data sheets
  * Perform other duties as assigned (to be less than 10% of the responsibilities listed above)

### **Pre-Requisites**

  * Must be a U.S. citizen eligible for government clearances

###  **Minimum Requirements**

  * Undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, or a related field and a record of academic excellence
  * 5+ years of relevant work experience (or 3+ years with an M.S. degree) in astrodynamics or aerospace engineering disciplines, with emphasis in orbit determination, spacecraft navigation, dynamic systems modeling and simulation, space weather/environment modeling, remote sensing, high-performance computing, or space operations
  * Demonstrated proficiency in algorithm development and implementation in a formal programming language (e.g. python, java/kotlin, C/C++) with experience developing in a Linux operating environment
  * Ability to work within multi-disciplinary teams in a fast-paced, evolving operational environment that spans military, government, and industry partners
  * Excellent verbal and written communications skills
  * Ability to travel up to 10% of the time

### **Preferred Skills**

  * Familiarity with, and development of, advanced orbit determination algorithms and techniques such as multi-target tracking, nonlinear estimation, fusion of multi-phenomenology sensor data, etc.
  * Orbit determination processing of GNSS navigation data
  * Understanding of AI applications to modern problems in space flight safety and space traffic management
  * Experience developing, implementing, and transitioning technology to production
  * Past development experience using and/or contributing to existing astrodynamics libraries.
  * Training or demonstrated experience in fields such as estimation theory, statistical estimation, orbit determination techniques, preferably utilizing real-world data sources

*These skills are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. You donâ€™t have to meet every qualification listed- if your skills are transferable and you meet the minimum requirements, we encourage you to apply.
