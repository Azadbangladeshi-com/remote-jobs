### About CourseCareers

Do you want to leave your mark on the world?

The college system has lied to us and cheated us. We've gone to war with the system and are on the front line fighting back.

No more will students be forced into debt just to be able to have access to a decent career that doesn't even utilize their education. Weâ€™re the modern way people start careers. We help everyone ranging from 18-year-olds using our program as a college alternative to people switching their careers later in life.

Within 10 years, we're going to bankrupt nearly every college in the US, saving millions from debt. More importantly, we're unlocking all of human potential in our economy.

Become a vigilante, and be a part of history!

### About the Role

Your mission is to replace the college system by creating the best online learning experience in the world and changing the way people start careers.

You will own the entire end-end education experience for multiple careers. Everything from identifying and doing in-depth market research to identifying which careers to support, finding the instructor for the course, managing the creation of the course, launching the course, and growing & optimizing the course.

Educational Experience Improvement: Recruit and onboard new coaches, enhance the coaching experience, and oversee general course operations. Ensure an exceptional learning experience for students in our Discord chat platform and foster an environment encouraging academic growth and support.

You'll be responsible for the metrics of the courses you own, such as enrollment %, refund %, average watch time, completion %, and job placement %.

_***This post is a joke representing the absurdity of what college is doing. With the average cost of college being around $25,000 per year, you're essentially paying $100 per day for outdated education since there are 251 working days in a year. Logically, you would be better off paying a company $100 per day for up-to-date education and relevant work experience.**_
