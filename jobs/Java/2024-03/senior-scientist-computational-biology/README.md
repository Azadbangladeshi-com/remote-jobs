### Sana Biotechnology  
#### `ðŸ’° 360000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### About the role

The Computational Biologist will work closely with scientists and other computational biologists to analyze NGS genomics data and develop bioinformatics methods to solve exciting and challenging problems in cell and gene therapy, immunology, and stem cell biology. You will develop workflows from raw sequencing data to variant calling and annotation to analyze somatic and germline variants in human genomes. You will evaluate and curate genomic data from various assays for clinical and research studies. You will partner with the Analytical Genomics team to develop genomic assays and work with the Computational Engineering team to refactor and automate analysis pipelines.

You will report to the lead of development team in Computational Biology. We prefer that you be a team player and fantastic at cross-functional communication. The ability to be flexible, to learn from and teach others genetics & genomics, and to work in a collaborative environment will be essential to success.

### What you'll do

  * Develop and optimize analysis workflows to analyze NGS data, including both whole genome sequencing (WGS/WES), targeted sequencing, and bulk/single cell RNA Seq
  * Develop novel Bioinformatics methods to answer platform and biological questions, and demonstrate validity of methods through prototypes and benchmarking using appropriate controls
  * Work with other computational biologists and computational engineers to deliver and optimize production-level pipelines
  * Proper documentation of code, workflows, and analyses including study reports for nonclinical and clinical studies and regulatory filings
  * Communicate to a broad audience with a range of technical, analytical, and biological expertise and present results on a regular basis at various group meetings

### What we're looking for

  * PhD in computational biology, bioinformatics, genetics, or related discipline with 5+ years of industry experience (or MSc with 8+ years of industry experience)
  * Strong scientific background including an understanding of molecular biology and genomics
  * Familiarity with NGS platforms and hands-on experience with all steps for analyzing NGS data
  * Demonstrated proficiency in script languages such as Python and familiarity with a compiled language such as C/C++ or Java
  * Routine use of version control such as git
  * Experience with high performance computing
  * Demonstrated strong analytical skills and problem-solving
  * Be detail oriented, self-motivated and able to prioritize multiple projects concurrently

### What will separate you from the crowd

  * Experience with variant calling, annotation, and interpretation for low frequency somatic mutations
  * Experience with transcriptome analysis
  * Experience with genomic data curation from both low-throughput and high-throughput assays
  * Experience with full cycle of assay development, including characterizing NGS artifacts, troubleshooting in collaboration with wet-lab biologists
  * Experience with AWS or similar cloud computing platforms
  * Familiarity with Docker and a workflow engine such as Nextflow or snakemake is a plus

### What you should know

  * The base pay range for this position at commencement of employment is expected to be between $160,000 and $200,000/year; however, base pay offered may vary depending on multiple individualized factors, including market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience
