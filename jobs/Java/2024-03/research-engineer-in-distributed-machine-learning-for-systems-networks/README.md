### TELEFONICA RESEARCH

Telefonica Research is a leading industrial research lab based in Barcelona (Spain). The aim of the lab is to carry out research studies on mid to long-term topics related to several technological areas of interest to the TelefoÃÅnica Group. The Research group follows an open research model in collaboration with universities and other research institutions, promoting the dissemination of their work both through publications and technology transfer. The board is constituted of a multi-disciplinary team with a variety of skills that includes systems, networks, HCI, Machine Learning and Privacy/Security. We are seeking candidates at all levels of seniority for research engineer positions to strengthen and complement our research efforts in the areas Telefonica Research is currently work on, relating to systems and networks, security and privacy of machine learning, networks, measurements, and beyond.

### MISSION

For this position, we are seeking talented and motivated candidates at all levels of seniority for a staff engineer position to strengthen and complement our efforts towards building robust Machine Learning (ML) models for telecommunication systems and networks. Special focus is given to the areas of distributed or federated ML, and how it can be applied to mobile systems and networks, and beyond. Knowledge or experience in the aspects of privacy and security in these areas will be highly valued. The ideal candidate will have strong experience in the entire ML lifecycle, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, optimization, and deployment, and will be passionate about building scalable and efficient ML systems based on their strong background in software engineering, machine learning, and distributed computing.

This role requires a deep understanding of ML engineering principles, strong analytical, programming and machine learning skills, and a drive to push the boundaries of technology in the research areas of interest of the Research Team. The ideal candidate will excel in a fast-paced, collaborative environment within our Team and beyond, and have a proven track record of delivering high-quality research outcomes. The Research Engineer will help the Team with potential dissemination of research results and prototype demonstrations to major industrial and academic venues worldwide, generation of intellectual property, and partnership with Telefonica business units to ensure the successful exploitation of research outputs. Finally, the Engineer will support the Team in pursuing available funding opportunities at the National, European and International level.
