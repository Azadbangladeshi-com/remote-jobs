### About Zowie:

At Zowie, we believe that buying online should feel like walking into your favorite local shop: personal, friendly, and easy. Our mission is to recreate offline shopping experiences online - but better. Zowie brings speed and empathy to customer interactions. Our platform automates responses to repetitive questions around return policy, order status, etc., and saves time for customer service agents, who can then proactively turn website visitors into paying customers. It can work as an add-on with existing tools (Zendesk, Shopify, Gorgias, etc.) or become a standalone customer service platform.

### We are:

🚀 Growing fast. We plan on keeping the Team growing! You’ll have a lot of autonomy and impact as we grow.

🏈 Like a sports team. We take ownership of our work and believe in personal accountability. At the same time, we work together, support each other, and focus on winning as a team.

🧑‍💻 Remote-first and hours are flexible. We allow everyone to figure out the best ways to collaborate with their team. At the end of the day, it's about delivering! Those in Poland can work from our offices in Cracow and Warsaw.

### We strive to be:

💪 Ambitious and innovative. We don’t settle on existing solutions and keep looking for better ways to tackle challenges.

👻 Bold and free-thinking. We trust our employees to find the best solutions.

🤸‍♀️ Agile and high-performing. We work smarter, not harder. We use our OKRs to keep ourselves focused.

🤠 Unafraid of change. Zowie is growing, and the market is changing. We thrive in an ever-evolving environment.

### What you'll do:

Do you like working on tooling and building things that help other developers? Keep reading!

You'll join our platform team as a first Backend Engineer. The team is led by Grzesiek (Zowie's Group Technical Lead) and currently have two Dev-Ops onboard. We want to expand this teams responsibility to focus even more on the mission of improving developers efficiency. You are going to play crucial role in it.

Don't be misled by our size! Despite being compact, we manage and enhance a sophisticated system comprising over 100 microservices, predominantly coded in Scala. These microservices communicate synchronously through gRPC, handle asynchronous calls via Kafka, expose GraphQL to the frontend, and leverage databases like PostgreSQL, Mongo, ElasticSearch, or Redis.

At Zowie, our engineering ethos is centered around the tangible impact our work has on our users. In this role, your direct customer will be people inside the company, but in the end we built it to more efficiently deliver the value to our customers.

We believe in the empowerment of our engineers to contribute not only to code but also to the strategic decisions that shape our product. This requires a holistic understanding of the business, the product, and the technology at play. Your expertise will enable you to connect the dots and provide valuable insights and guide the best course of action.

Autonomy and meritocracy are at the core of our values. We champion the idea that sound, arguments should prevail. As part of the team, you'll be instrumental in shaping end-to-end solutions, influencing architecture decisions, and proposing crucial enhancements to our engineering practices.

Since you are going to work with internal teams and improve their lives, your daily routing will require jumping into their shoes, understanding their needs and building platform solutions that can really bring a lasting difference. You will prioritise the work mainly together with Grzesiek and our two backend tech leads.

I know this is not really covering everything. I'm sure you have more questions. Let's have an open discussion during the interview process—I'm committed to transparency, and I hope for the same authenticity from you. Looking forward to our collaboration! 🚀
