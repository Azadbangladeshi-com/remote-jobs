About Netflix

At Netflix, we want to entertain the world and are constantly innovating on how entertainment is imagined, created, and delivered to a global audience. We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 220 million paid subscribers, and are expanding into new forms of entertainment, such as gaming.

Org Overview:

The data infrastructure teams at Netflix enable us to leverage data to bring joy to our members in many different ways. We provide centralized data platforms and tools for various business functions at Netflix, so they can utilize our data to make critical data-driven decisions. We do all the heavy lifting to make it easy for our business partners to work with data efficiently, securely, and responsibly. We aspire to lead the industry standard in building a world-class data infrastructure, as Netflix leads the way to be the most popular and pervasive destination for global internet entertainment.

About the Data Access Platform Team:

Our team champions advancements in data abstractions, building streamlined abstractions atop distributed data stores, like Apache Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Memcached, and S3. We cater to diverse Netflix use cases, including counters, flexible key-values, and time series. Beyond this, we're the custodians of Hollow, Netflix's robust memory co-located dataset library for efficient publishing and consumption. With Hollow, weâ€™re setting new standards in reducing the footprint of in-memory datasets while allowing rapid access to data, benefiting hundreds of Netflix applications across all business verticals. Our mandate is clear: empower Netflix's microservices to meet their increasing and dynamic data requirements.

  * Architecting robust, scalable, and efficient data serialization, dissemination, and access in a distributed infrastructure.

  * Collaborating with a diverse group of engineers, product managers, and TPMs.
  * Engaging with the open-source community and contributing to Netflix OSS.

### About You:

  * 7+ years experience in crafting complex, scalable distributed data infrastructure.
  * Proficiency in Java or C++, with a solid understanding of multi-threading, memory management, and RPC frameworks.
