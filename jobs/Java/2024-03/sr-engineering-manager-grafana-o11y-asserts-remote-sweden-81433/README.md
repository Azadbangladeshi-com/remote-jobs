### About the role:

This is a remote opportunity, and we would be interested in applications in Canada. The Engineering team is located in the US and India timezones.

We are looking for an Engineering Manager to help us grow and develop our engineering team. Our managers take an active role in creating a productive environment for our engineers, be it through removing blockers and impediments, facilitating cross-team collaboration and understanding, or by aiding the team in helping themselves by constantly improving and refining their working practices. Youâ€™ll be responsible for managing a team of distributed engineers working across a variety of systems and helping them to perform at their best.

The Asserts team joined Grafana Labs as part of an acquisition and is now growing. The team is responsible for building and operating a set of low-latency microservices built in Java. The services provide automated Root Cause Insights by actively scanning the Grafana Metrics, Traces, and Logs databases and integrating with the Dashboarding and Alerting components. The Asserts services are multi-tenant, highly available and process and store data in Graph and Timeseries DB. We will soon be rolling it out to thousands of self-service customers and it's critical that as we grow, we improve our performance, increase our reliability, and do it all more efficiently.

We want customers to have a faster time to value without needing to become experts in the data and underlying query languages.

  * Ideally, you will have a Computer Science degree or equivalent experience and have worked as a Software Engineer before moving into Management
  * Asserts services are built on Java. All our core databases are built on Go.
  * Familiarity with public Cloud and/or Kubernetes would be a strong advantage
  * Familiarity with Git, Linux, Prometheus, Graphite, Influxdb and/or Elasticsearch would all be an advantage

###  **Your day-to-day will include** :

  * Managing release schedule, assisting and participating in cross-functional collaboration inside and outside the team
