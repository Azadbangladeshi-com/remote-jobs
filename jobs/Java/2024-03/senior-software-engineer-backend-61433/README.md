Buying Experience Group is on a mission to empower teams to create world-class buying experiences. Within this group, weâ€™re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Rep Quoting Experience Backend team.

This team focuses on two main areas; Approvals and Quoting, with 85% of the company's revenue coming through the Quoting product alone. On this team youâ€™ll be continuing to improve a platform that is secure, reliable, scalable, and flexible

As a backend engineer on the Rep Quoting Experience Team, you will:

  * Write and ship production code that has meaningful user and business impact
  * Envision, build and analyze new features and tools, each contributing to company growth and revenue
  * Work with a small cross functional team of engineers, PMs, designers, content designers, and researchers
  * Collaborate with HubSpotters all over the company, whether in engineering, product, design, research, etc
  * Help HubSpot users meet their goals, via changes youâ€™ve made
  * Get exposure to how HubSpot works as a business

You may be a fit if:

  * You have backend development experience. We work with Java, MySQL, AWS, DropWizard, Kafka and Kubernetes primarily, but experience with specific technologies is secondary to understanding programming fundamentals.
  * You have a strong focus on the user. You can gain empathy for their challenges and understand how they may flow through our product.
  * You not only get excited about big, technical challenges, but also about being very close to the business and our go-to-market strategies
  * Take ownership, work collaboratively, and figure things out
  * Someone who has shown that they can solve complicated technical problems and analyze tradeoffs with empathy for the developers, yet build creative solutions.
