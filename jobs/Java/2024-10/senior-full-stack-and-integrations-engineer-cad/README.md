Dandy is transforming the massive ($200B) but antiquated dental industry. Backed by some of the world's leading venture capital investors, we are on an ambitious mission to integrate and simplify every function of the dental practice through technology. By building the operating system for every dental office in America, Dandy is empowering dentists with technology, innovation, and world-class support to achieve more for their practice, their people, and their patients.

 **About the Role**

Dandy is seeking a talented Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer to join our CAD and 3D team. As a senior software engineer, you will be supporting Dandyâ€™s web based 3D toolset across our internal supply chain. We are developing a suite of 3D design tools that accelerate, reduce the cost of, and increase the quality of our patient-matched restorations. Our in-house tools allow designers to create rich, efficient, and intuitive experiences for our internal end users. However their full impact cannot be realized until they are orchestrated, integrated and monitored across a complex operations process at scale.

 **Our stack:** TypeScript, NodeJS, NestJS, Graphql, PostgreSQL, React/Redux, Google Cloud, THREE.js, C++, WASM

 **What You'll Do**

  * Develop and maintain world-class web applications supporting a robust suite of 3D design interactions.

  * Orchestrate the availability of our 3D tools to our internal workforce based on supply chain event triggers while matching capability with capacity.

  * Coordinate the submission and storage of browser based CAD outputs to the cloud and subsequent distribution to our remote manufacturing centers.

  * Support and develop internal APIâ€™s, endpoints and microservices.

  * Instrument our tools to provide rich data insights that help plan, forecast, and improve capacity or throughput.

  * Build integrations with 3rd party APIâ€™s: Transmit 3D data payloads for processing and retrieve the resultant outputs.

  * Collaborate with and serve as our liaison to the Product Management or Manufacturing Operations engineering teams.

  * Solve technical problems of moderate scope and complexity.

  * Craft code that meets our internal standards for style, maintainability, and best practices. Maintain and advocate for these standards through code review.

  * Recognize impediments to our efficiency as a team ("technical debt"), propose and implement solutions.

  * Advocate for improvements to product quality, security, and performance.

 **What We're Looking For**

  * 6+ years of software engineering experience

  * Ability to understand how our business functions and how challenges and bottlenecks can be addressed through the Engineering team.

  * The ability to clearly and concisely communicate about complex technical, architectural, and/or organizational problems and propose thorough iterative solutions.

  * Comfort working in a highly agile, intensely iterative software development process.

  * Effective communication skills: Regularly achieve consensus with peers and clear status updates.

  * Experience owning a project from concept to production, including proposal, discussion, and execution, observation and maintenance.

  * Self-motivated and self-managing, with excellent organizational skills.

  * Ability to thrive in a remote-first organization.

  * High proficiency with back end systems (nest, next, node, graphql etc)

 **Bonus Points For**

  * Experience with TypeScript

  * Familiarity with 3D file formats, transmission, storage and interactions with cloud infrastructure

  * Time spent engineering in pursuit of operations or supply chain verticals

  * Relentlessly positive attitude, a strong sense of humor, and the ability to have fun at work
