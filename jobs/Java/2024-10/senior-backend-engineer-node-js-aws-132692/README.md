## **About Siena**

Siena is building enterprise empathic AI Agents powered by reasoning-adept LLMs. Siena is the first AI Agent of its kind, designed to integrate with existing systems and interact with customers across multiple channels from a single, unified platform.

If you're excited about the intersection of human-to-machine communication and want to be part of a team driving innovation and making a real impact in automating agentic workflows, join us on our mission to revolutionize customer experience through empathetic AI.

##  **Some of our values**

We're not big on corporate-speak, but here's what matters to us:

  *  **We put customers first** : We work hard to understand our customers. We try to put ourselves in their position and do more than they expect.

  *  **We're direct and honest** : We believe in straightforward, truthful communication. We say what we think, clearly and respectfully.

  *  **We try new things** : We're not afraid to do things differently if it means finding better solutions.

  *  **We step up** : When we see a chance to make a difference, we take it. We trust ourselves to decide and take responsibility for what happens.

  *  **We're quick on our feet** : We adapt to changes and challenges. We see them as chances to learn and grow.

  *  **We stay curious** : We ask questions and explore new ideas. What we learn helps us keep growing.

  *  **We own it** : We're all owners here. We take charge, make the call, and own the outcome. 

## **The role & what you'll be doing:**

In the role of senior backend engineer, you own projects end to end. Ownership is yours - take over new and existing product features.

  * You'll contribute with ideas and constructive feedback to the product's development from the roadmap all the way to architecture.

  * You'll develop and collaborate closely with the Product team to slice and dice scope and deliver piece by piece.

  * Building products: 80% of time by building new software products, or improve existing features.

  * Mentorship: you have the ability to mentor and lead other members about 20% of time if you have an appetence for it.

  * Problem-solving: you unblock yourself and other team members when they hit a roadblock.

##  **Join the team if you:**

  * Have previous experience working on the backend for **4+ years** \- ideally with **NodeJS, Typescript & Express**

  * Are familiar with the **AWS** cloud system. (EKS, ECS, Fargate)

  * Have experience working with **Postgres** (or similar)

  * Have experience with **CI/CD** (GitLab, Github, Jenkins or similar)

  * You are **product-focused** and have the ability to build microservices products by understanding the business and customers.

  * You have the **drive and focus** to get challenging projects over the finish line while meeting deadlines.

  * You love solving problems **and** writing elegant code.

  * You are proud of your **microservices architecture skills**. But don't like to brag.

  * You thrive in a **fast-paced** environment.

    
    
    We're not aiming for expert levels in Node.js, but rather cross-language minded engineers that view and use stacks as problem-solving tools, not the solution.

##  **Impress us even further:**

  * You have a high degree of technical knowledge around scaling systems.

  * You have been in a startup from Seed to exit.

  * You have experience working in remote teams.

##  **Why Joins Us**

We're a startup. We can't offer you fancy offices or extra perks. But here's what we can offer:

  * Real impact. Your work will directly shape our product and company.

  * A seat at the table. In a small team, every voice matters. Yours will be heard.

  * Freedom to work your way. Home, coffee shop, moon base - if you're productive, we're happy.

  * Top pay. Competitive salary and an opportunity for equity or stock grants. 

  * Time off when you need it. Take at least 15 days. More if you need it. 

  * Budget to keep learning. Because if you're not growing, we're not growing.

  * The chance to build something from the ground up. This is the time when what you do has the biggest impact.

  * Problems worth solving. We're reshaping how work gets done.

At Siena, weâ€™re not just looking for people who can do a job. Weâ€™re looking for people who want to break boundaries, create the future, and reshape industries. If thatâ€™s you, we look forward to your application.
