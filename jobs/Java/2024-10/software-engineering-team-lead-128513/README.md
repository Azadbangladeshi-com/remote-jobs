  * Technical Design and Architecture: Lead the team in designing and developing scalable, highly available, and complex systems. You will play a key role in evolving our architecture to ensure reliability and performance across microservices and micro front-ends. Youâ€™ll guide the team in making architectural decisions that are aligned with best practices and business objectives, ensuring the system remains adaptable to future needs.

  * Adherence to Standards: Lead by example, ensuring your team adheres to Geoforce's engineering & architectural standards and best practices. Youâ€™ll contribute to setting and improving these standards, driving technical excellence and innovation.
