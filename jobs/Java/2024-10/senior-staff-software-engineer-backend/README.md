At Eppo, we are building the future of experimentation, so that every company can have an entrepreneurial, customer oriented culture. We believe that AB experiments uniquely put customers at the center of product decisions instead of political processes.

Our next-gen platform allows companies to 10x their volume of AB experiments by embracing the full technical rigor of engineering and statistics while focusing intensely on the evangelism of results and accessibility to business users. We are built for the modern cloud infrastructure, with easy integrations and an emphasis on privacy and security.

Our team is made up of veteran product builders from Airbnb, Slack, and Snowflake, and our product is powering experimentation at some of top companies around the world. Weâ€™ve raised over $47M funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Innovation Endeavors, Icon Ventures, Menlo VC, and Amplify Partners. See our Series B announcement here.

# About the Role

We are looking for a senior backend developer who is interested in working with big data systems. You will play a lead role with our data engineering team to build out the (very) high scale systems that manage our customers experiments using Big Query, Snowflake, and RedShift. This is a role for a true polyglot, capable of solving hard engineering problems that work across different data architectures to make experiments work for our customers. You will write backend software using Nest.js (Typescript) to power AirFlow tasks and our front-end API.

At Eppo we work with data scientists and engineers at some of the worldâ€™s largest technology companies. You will become an expert in these systems and see first-hand what the bleeding edge of data technology looks like today.
