# Who we are

Socket's mission is to help developers and security teams to ship faster and spend less time on security busywork. Thousands of organizations use Socket to safely discover, audit, and manage their open source code. Our customers â€“ from OpenAI to Figma â€“ absolutely love Socket (just read their tweets to see for yourself!)

The company was founded by Feross Aboukhadijeh, who has worked in open source software for 10+ years and taught Stanford University's Web Security course since 2019. We have raised $25M in funding from the best angel investors, operators, and security leaders in the industry.

Our team is small and talent-dense. Our founding team has published open source code that is downloaded over 1 billion times per month, and includes leaders and builders who have worked at the cutting edge of open source and security.

# Role

  *  **Build product** : This role will require you to move fast, prioritize ruthlessly, and be focused on the end user. Your voice will be essential in shaping the product and the roadmap, and your decisions will have immediate and far-reaching impact. You will work in collaboration with the engineering and design teams.

  *  **Grow the team and culture** : As an early member of the team, you will form the defining DNA for the company's culture and our future team. Our ability to build a market-defining product is solely dependent on the culture we foster.

  *  **Set up foundational frameworks** : You'll join at the genesis of something totally new and come into a fast-paced environment. We value process-driven systems that enable us to work smarter as we scale, and you'll build out design systems that will serve as guide rails for the engineering team.

# What we are looking for

# At Socket, we

  1.  **Pursue Excellence:** We set ourselves apart by consistently delivering work of exceptional quality and distinction.

  3.  **Think rigorously:** We care about being right and it often takes reasoning from first principles to get there. We value alternative perspectives and have constructive discussions.

  4.  **Trust and amplify:** We overtrust, always assume good intent, and give specific feedback to help each other improve.

  5.  **Feel a strong sense of ownership:** We wear many hats and feel a strong sense of overall ownership of the company and we're non-territorial regarding our nominal domains.

  6.  **Are customer obsessed:** We relentlessly prioritize the needs of our customers, striving to exceed their expectations and delight them at every interaction.
