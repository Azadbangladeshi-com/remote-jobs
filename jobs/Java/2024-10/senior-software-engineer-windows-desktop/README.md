**What You'll Do**

  * Maintaining our scanning subsystems

    * Scanner integrations

    * Software bridges to support ordering from the various scanners, through our ordering systems

  * Building out new integrations for additional scanner types

  * Investigating root causes for native windows app issues

  * Profiling, establishing baselines and making progress on app performance

  * Utilizing Windows app registry and logging utilities to triage issues

  * Improving our windows development and build processes

  * Windows software development experience
