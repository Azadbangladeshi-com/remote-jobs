## **About the job**

Flex is a growth-stage, NYC headquartered FinTech company that is creating the best rent payment experience. Itâ€™s hard to believe that itâ€™s 2024 and paying rent on time is expensive, inflexible, and difficult. Weâ€™re here to change that! Flex enables our users to pay rent throughout the month on a schedule that better fits their finances and budget. Our mission is to empower as many renters as possible with flexibility over their most significant recurring expense. After deliberately keeping a stealth profile as we built up unprecedented investor support and an enthusiastic user base, we are looking for motivated individuals to help us keep our mission growing. Will you be a part of the team?

Flex is looking for a Senior Software Engineer who will be responsible for implementing the various backend systems that support all business features.

Youâ€™ll work closely with your product, design and engineering peers to solve our users' most pressing problems around rent payment. Youâ€™ll roll out changes to our customers in an agile manner with a delivery cadence that favors small, frequent iterations.

  * You have experience implementing and operating services in distributed services environments at scale
  * You have experience with observability and monitoring tools such as DataDog for maintaining high availability
  * You write high quality code that is testable, maintainable, scalable and secure
  * You have a good understanding of REST and mobile API best practices
  * You have great communication skills and are comfortable working with a distributed team  
  

Core competencies:

  * Prior experience working on cross-functional teams
  * Experience with leading the project in its entire lifecycle, from requirements gathering to delivery.
  * Proficient with Java and Spring (Bonus: AWS, Containers, Kubernetes, MySql)
  * Experience with CI/CD to improve code stability and code quality

_The national pay range for this role is $195000-210000 in base salary. Individual compensation will be commensurate with the candidate's experience aligned with Flex's internal leveling guidelines and benchmarks._
