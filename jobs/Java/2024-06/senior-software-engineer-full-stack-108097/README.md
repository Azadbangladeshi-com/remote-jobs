### Planet  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Slovenia, Remote`  

**About the Role:**

The front-end team within Sentinel Hub is looking for full-stack engineer who like challenging tasks on a combination of (mostly) front-end, (some) back-end and (occasional) DevOps work. Sentinel Hub (SH) is a world-renown service for distribution of satellite data, processing hundreds of millions of requests on 20PB+ archive every month.

Our front-end team develops applications on top of SH and Planet APIs such as EO Browser or Planet Explorer. In this role, you will be asked to extend existing features and set up new applications from scratch.

The SH back-end is proportionally complex, based on micro-services spawning over tens (sometimes thousands) of virtual machines running on AWS and four other clouds.

We are looking for someone who enjoys writing production-ready code that works at scale (our APIs are used by thousands of developers around the world).

The SH team is using React for the front-end, and Java for the back end. We take a modern software development approach and follow and evaluate new developments in the field.

**Impact Youâ€™ll Own:**

  * Design and develop RESTful APIs and other web services
  * Write technical documentation
  * Integrate SH and Planet APIs into reusable UI components for SH use cases
  * Maintain existing and develop new SH applications
  * Design, develop and help shape the web application for Planetâ€™s growing Earth Data Platform
  * Conduct code reviews

**What You Bring:**

  * Expertise with React (or similar JavaScript frameworks) & Material UI
  * Good knowledge of HTTP, REST, JSON, and HTML5/CSS3
  * Experience with Redux for state management
  * Experience with Jest for unit tests
  * Expertise with Java 11+ for the backend
    * JAX-RS, CDI, Jackson or micronaut
    * Junit, testcontainers
  * Experience with the Grafana ecosystem
  * Database experience:
    * PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Timescale
    * InfluxDB, prometheus
  * Experience with GCP and AWS hyperscale clouds, OpenStack
  * Experience with Nomad for container orchestration and consul for service networking
  * Experience with Gradle, gitlabCI, Jenkins for build and one-click deployment automation
  * Proven cross-functional collaboration skills (Product & Design)
  * Experience in improving team processes and developer velocity 
  * Experience in mentoring junior team members and knowledge sharing

**What Makes You Stand Out:**

  * Experience in building platforms
  * 5+ years of experience in software development
  * Experience with geospatial technologies and data (e.g. Leaflet/OpenLayer for interactive maps)

**Benefits While Working at Planet:**

  * Additional company winter holidays and regular global days off
  * Remote friendly work environment and flexible working hours
  * Contribution to our growth by offering equity options for employees
  * Giving back to the community - one day per quarter for charitable work
  * Learning and Tuition Reimbursement
  * Regular hack-weeks and meetup events to exchange knowledge
  * Home office budget
  * Employee Resource Groups providing empowering spaces for connection and mentorship
