###  **Job Description**

Running a restaurant or a store while fulfilling delivery orders is hard work that can be made easy with automation. This is where our integration platform comes in. We help our merchant partners automate the manual work with our API and integration offerings. Once a merchant has these integrations in place, their staff are free to do what they do best - service consumers without being bogged down by mundane, repetitive, and error prone manual processes.

Through our API platform, we ensure that the experience for our partners is best in class, making it a breeze to work with Wolt. Be it orders going to POS (Point of Sale) systems automatically, venue management, item & inventory control, menu & catalog automation, our teams have our merchants covered!  
  
As our new Kotlin Backend Engineer, you will be joining one of our Core API teams to make sure that we continue building integration products that delight our partners when managing their daily operations.

 **Cool stuff about the teams in Merchant Integrations:**

üèÜ **Ownership:** We handle the whole development process (business logic, testing, database & data streaming, CI/CD, analytics, cloud) ourselves in an autonomous manner. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre not alone: We have support from central teams when we need help.

üî¨ **Technology:** We use state of the art tools and technologies, and we‚Äôre open to new ones! Current stack in use: Kotlin, MongoDB, Kafka, GitHub Actions, AWS, Docker and Kubernetes.

üëä **Autonomy:** We make the decisions as a team and group of teams for our ways of working and we take architectural decisions together. Everyone plays a role in our future.

üìà **Growth:** There is a lot of room for learning, teaching and growing together. You will be getting personally tailored career growth opportunities to unleash your full potential, we know that everyone is unique.

üíª **Flexibility:** You can choose whether you want to work from home, from the office or hybrid. It‚Äôs up to you, we don‚Äôt monitor people.

ü§ù **Diversity:** We have different people with different backgrounds. Cultivating diversity and maintaining different opinions is the key to our success.

üî• **Impact:** Want to see the impact of your work? We provide our merchants with innovative tools and systems to become more and more efficient and successful, and with that our customers would also get a better experience when ordering with Wolt. We simply make it win-win for everyone!

üìçThis role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki, Berlin or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in these countries. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - please let us know your preferred location(s) with your application.

### **Qualifications**

 **Hands-on:** We are looking for people who have strong experience building high-quality software. This can include working with Apps, APIs and integrations, handling the whole development cycle all the way to production. Having said that, seniority at Wolt is measured by skills, not the number of years on your CV.

 **Skilled:** We want you to be proficient with JVM on the backend. We use Kotlin but find expertise in other JVM backend languages like Java and Scala genuinely relevant as a starting off point for learning Kotlin, which is our main backend programming language.  
  
**Communicator & collaborator: **We work closely with our teammates and having a good connection with team members is essential. We understand that everyone has their own unique way of communicating with others. We expect you to be yourself, express your opinions, and work together with the rest of the team.

###  **Additional Information**

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!

The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you‚Äôll own a piece of the pie.
