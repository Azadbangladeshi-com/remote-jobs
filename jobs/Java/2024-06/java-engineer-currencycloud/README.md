 **Partner with Visa: A Network Working for Everyone.**

###  **Job Description**

 **About the role**

Currencycloud was acquired by Visa in December 2021. Our **Java Engineers** are responsible for implementing an industry-leading API that has already processed over $50 billion of cross-border transactions for over 5 million end users, and is available to our clients 24/7. But we‚Äôre not stopping there, and our engineers are at the forefront of taking us forward to meet the demands of even greater scale.

We‚Äôve moved wholesale to AWS where our system runs as a set of distributed applications. We‚Äôre currently in the process of migrating those applications over to Kubernetes and Jenkins-X as we further embrace a microservice-led architecture. We are also utilising Kafka for our streaming and PACT for Contract testing.

 **What you'll get to do:**

  * As a **Java Engineer** you‚Äôll play a key role within your cross functional team; taking responsibility for your services and the technology within them.
  * These roles fit in to squads who are building out brand new parts to our payments platform, focusing on high availability, cloud native, microservice concepts

 **You'll get:**

  * Clear ownership of your domain
  * A clean modern codebase
  * An independent path to production
  * Strong platform and product support
  * The ability to make real changes with real business value. 

**Remote work:**  
VXBS Tech roles are Remote-First, either in the UK or Netherlands. You will need to be based in one of these countries and have the necessary work permissions.

###  **Qualifications**

  * 3+ years experience in Java Backend Development

  * Skills with functional Java (versions 8+) and Spring (ideally Springboot)

  * Agile ways of working such as Scrum or Kanban in cross-functional teams

  * Some knowledge of Docker, EKS, AWS (public cloud) or Kafka

 **Our Tech Stack includes:**

  * Object-oriented programming forms the bulk of our codebase, currently in Java, versions 11+, and ideally Springboot framework

  * Highly-scalable, highly-available, cloud-native applications on AWS are key to our next phase of growth, are written to 12-factor principles and fit into our microservices architecture

  * Cloud-related tools, services, and distributed system observability to support these applications, such as Docker, Kubernetes, ElasticSearch, log management systems, and Datadog APM, to name but a few

  * API specifications, conforming to the OpenAPI (Swagger) standard, provide a clean boundary both externally between our customers and our product, and internally between our microservices

  * SQL, and large SQL databases, provide the persistence layer for our applications. You‚Äôll be working with (and know the limitations of using) such large datastores

  * Infrastructure automation is primarily owned by the infrastructure team, but you will be a consumer of their work, familiarity with AWS, Terraform and Docker is beneficial

  * Testing approaches, including TDD, BDD and Contract Testing, all form an important part of our approach to quality assurance; ensuring that the code that we write forms products that are fit for use. We currently use a variety of frameworks including JUnit, RSpec and Cucumber

  * Agile development, with teams broadly aligned with the Spotify - Squads & Tribes - model, helps us deliver incremental improvements to our products in an iterative manner. Advocating this model, and joining us on a journey of continuous improvement, is a key attribute of members of our teams

  * Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines allow us to ‚Äúautomate all the things‚Äù, providing repeatable builds and consistent deployments

  * GitHub, and the GitHub PR review process, forms a core part of our developer workflow, and peer reviews help share knowledge and improve quality

  * Teamwork, and cross-team collaboration, is fundamental to the delivery of our applications. Whilst each application has an independent path to production, there will always be some activities and initiatives that span multiple teams and require cross-team collaboration. Within your team you‚Äôll need to collaborate with a number of stakeholders, including Product Owners and QA, as part of your product development

###  **Additional Information**

 **Think you have what it takes?**

If you are interested in a career that will challenge and inspire you ‚Äì we‚Äôd love to hear from you!

 **Diversity & Inclusion **

Universal acceptance for everyone, everywhere, is not only our brand promise, it‚Äôs the foundation of our company culture. We foster a feeling of connectedness in the workplace, support diversity of thought, culture and background, fight for important initiatives like Equal Pay and actively work to eliminate unconscious biases that hold us all back.

By leveraging the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of our worldwide teams, Visa is a better place to work and a better business partner to our clients.
