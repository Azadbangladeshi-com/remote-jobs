### Outer Labs  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### Company Description

We believe that now is the time to reevaluate the tools and methods we use to measure the impact of spaces where we live, work, and play. Building sustainably at a global scale requires better technology and processes for the people involved. We're attacking this at the core -- Outer Labs provides modern human-centric apps for stakeholders who can directly influence the way real estate, architecture, and construction decisions are made.

Some questions we find ourselves asking: â€‹How can technology help an Architect explore thousands of ideas in the time it currently takes to explore one? How can software optimize the quality of space for usability while reducing the cost and resources required to build?â€‹ How do we encourage adoption of reusable solutions that can be manufactured more sustainably and efficiently?

Answers to these questions require deep expertise in design and engineering that comes from every level of our company. This is why weâ€™ve invested deeply in building a culture that empowers its employees to do great work and directly shape the future of its products. We want smart, creative, and intentional individuals to be part of our core team. Are you in?  
  
Please note that while this position will start 100% remote, there is a possibility that you may need to transition to working in an office environment. Explicit details will be shared during the interview process.

### Job Description

We are actively seeking an experienced, creative, and pragmatic Senior Software Engineer to join our growing team. The engineering team is a mix of people from traditional CS backgrounds as well as non-traditional backgrounds such as architecture, mechanical engineering, music, and more. We value this diversity and pride ourselves on being a place that creates opportunities for motivated individuals to move into technology careers.

Our stack includes Java, Angular, Golang, React, Typescript, ThreeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud Platform. We strive to write clean, maintainable code that is tested, documented, and understood across the team. We are a small team, and you will work on a variety of problems across the stack. You will have a voice and influence on technical direction and decisions, and are expected to contribute to making our team the best it can be.

### What Youâ€™ll Do:

  * Design, develop, test, deploy, maintain, and improve Outer Labs software 
  * Manage both individual and team-wide project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables
  * Act as a pillar of the software engineering team, using your experience to help guide technical decisions and direction
  * Perform technical investigations on sometimes open-ended problems, form well-researched and defensible opinions on technical decisions

  * Collaborate with other disciplines on our team, including product management, design, and business development
  * Proactively communicate with other members of the team, and sometimes external clients
  * Teach what you know, acting as a mentor when appropriate, while staying open to a process of constant learning

### Qualifications

  * 8+ years software development experience in one or more general purpose programming languages.

  * Deep experience with Java or Angular. You will be expected to learn many new tools, but this will form the foundation of your role.

  * Experience working with development practices at scale, or in large organizations.

  * Ability to think abstractly about complex systems

  * Enthusiasm for collaborative work. Outer Labs values working on projects together, bouncing ideas off each other, and swapping responsibilities as necessary to work quickly and smoothly.

  * Strong communication skills. Outer Labs is a highly remote/distributed company. We communicate through written documents, Slack, Hangouts, phone, and email. You should be a good listener and reader as well as able to get your ideas across clearly and respectfully.

  * BS degree in Computer Science, similar technical field of study or equivalent practical experience.

  * Experience or interest in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, & Construction) is a huge plus.

Outer Labs is a great place to work, and we care deeply about our team! Beyond creating a place where people can do their best, we also believe in fairness, equity, and creating opportunities for people from all sorts of backgrounds.

### Some of the benefits we offer include:

  * Unlimited PTO
  * 11 paid company holidays
  * Computer and home office setup of your choice, or access to a co-working space if desired
  * Healthcare, dental, and vision insurance for employee & dependents. We cover 85% of the cost for employee, and 75% of the cost for dependents
