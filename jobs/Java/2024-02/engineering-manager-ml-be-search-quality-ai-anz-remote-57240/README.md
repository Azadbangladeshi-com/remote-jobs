### Canva  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Australia`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work:

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### What youâ€™d be doing in this role:

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

Coaching, mentoring, and growing a team that is a mix of machine learning engineers and backend engineers while developing your coaching capability to scale the team and meet the needs of the team vision. This will be achieved by:

  * Helping the team deliver scalable and robust product features to the core experience for Canva users around the world.
  * Encouraging machine learning excellence by helping your teamâ€™s MLEs grow their ability to do high-velocity, product-oriented, and novel machine learning projects.
  * Ensuring that your team maintains a high degree of operational readiness by contributing to operational planning, dashboard reviews, and post-incident-reviews.
  * Owning and driving the delivery of large, cross-team, and cross-group initiatives and projects from ideation to completion, with autonomy and independence of decision making.
  * Collaborating with the Product Manager to understand and contribute to the product roadmap.
  * Driving the planning and refinement of seasonal goals, ensuring there is alignment between the company, group, and teams.
  * Contributing to high-impact Canva Company goals like Magic Design when the opportunity presents itself.

Youâ€™ll also foster a culture of collaboration and advocating for the engineering needs of non-technical collaborators within the group.

### You're probably a match if:

  * You have a history of success in technical people leadership and mentorship of engineers.
  * Youâ€™ll have commercial experience in a software development environment, with a focus on launching novel machine learning systems into production and maintaining a high quality bar for launched systems. Our backend stack is service oriented, mostly running on Java and Python backends and on AWS Infrastructure managed by Terraform.
  * Have firmly grounded computer science and engineering fundamentals including concurrency, multithreading, data structures, solution design, architecture, and design patterns.
  * Youâ€™ll have experience contributing to the full life cycle of ML/data models: data analysis, data preprocessing and pipeline, modelling, tuning and productionization.
  * Youâ€™ll have exceptional problem-solving skills, with the ability to break large projects down into smaller ones and deliver on them through others.

### About the team

Search Qualityâ€™s mission is to promote and expose Canvaâ€™s content to current and potential users. Without good discovery, users canâ€™t benefit from the wide range of content Canva has on offer. We are responsible for the AI, Machine Learning, Infrastructure and User Experience that powers Canvaâ€™s discovery experience.

 **These are some of the search domains the team is responsible for:**

  * Templates, for finding the starting point for a userâ€™s design
  * Elements, for exploring the wealth of photos, graphics, videos and audio and finding the one just right for a userâ€™s task
  * Private content, for finding a userâ€™s (or their teammatesâ€™) previous work and uploaded content

The teamâ€™s work directly impacts almost all of Canvaâ€™s users. That scale allows us to iterate rapidly, going from idea to implementation to experiment quickly and then make data-driven decisions from the results.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
