### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, ä½ å¥½, hallo, vÃ­tejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.  
  
 **What youâ€™d be doing in this role**

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * **Defining Technical Direction:** Own and execute the strategy and development of search retrieval capabilities of the platform; working with other engineering and product leads in the Discovery Group of Groups (GoG) and Canva wide teams.
  * **Leading Strategy Execution:** Accountable for the delivery of goals across the team and maintain relationships with adjacent teams that rely on your team to move forward.
  * **Driving Team Performance:** Maintaining a culture of high performance and accountability, breaking down goals into actionable tasks and overseeing successful delivery.
  * **Motivating & Aligning Teams: **Inspiring and aligning team interests with priorities, providing clear feedback and fostering collaboration between cross-functional leads.
  * **Cultivating Team Culture:** Nurturing a healthy and inclusive engineering culture, fostering growth and development opportunities for team members while upholding operational best practices.

### You're probably a match if

  * Proven Leadership: Demonstrated success in both people and technical leadership, with robust interpersonal skills. The ability to effectively engage with a team comprised largely of senior professionals is crucial, as this role places a strong emphasis on people leadership.
  * Technical Proficiency: A solid technical backend background in Java is essential - whether you've excelled as an individual contributor in a platform team or have successfully managed a team with a focus on platform-related initiatives.
  * DevOps and On-call Experience: Experience in building and fostering a DevOps culture within a team, as well as establishing and managing on-call practices is highly valued, showcasing your commitment to operational excellence.
  * Bonus experience (not mandatory): You have experience in Search or worked with search related technologies such as Elasticsearch, Opensearch, etc.

**About the team**  
  
The Search Platform Team plays a pivotal role in supporting Canva's expansive user base by supporting the infrastructure, platform, and products essential for content discovery. We empower our users by finding the right template for their next pitch deck, the perfect picture for their promotional instagram post, and to quickly find the document they shared 2 weeks with their boss. Discoverable content, both in the form of templates and ingredients, is Canvaâ€™s moat.

The Search Platform Team has been entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the highest throughput machine learning (ML) and information retrieval systems at Canva. Simultaneously, we are laying the groundwork for the next generation of ML and generative AI capabilities, ensuring Canva remains at the forefront of innovation in this dynamic landscape.
