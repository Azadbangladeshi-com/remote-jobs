Elastic is a free and open search company that powers enterprise search, observability, and security solutions built on one technology stack that can be deployed anywhere. From finding documents to monitoring infrastructure to hunting for threats, Elastic makes data usable in real-time and at scale. Thousands of organizations worldwide, including Barclays, Cisco, eBay, Fairfax, ING, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, The Mayo Clinic, NASA, The New York Times, Wikipedia, and Verizon, use Elastic to power mission-critical systems. Founded in 2012, **Elastic is a distributed company** with Elasticians around the globe. Learn more at **elastic.co**.

The Elasticsearch team is in charge of building the core platform that powers search for Elasticâ€™s customers and users for e-commerce, observability, SIEM, and more. This globally-distributed team of experienced engineers focuses on delivering a robust and feature-rich search experience, including contributing to improving the search experience in Lucene, evolving the search tier of our Serverless architecture, and building search functionality in our new piped query language, ES|QL.

This is an experienced team lead role where you will be working with the team that delivers these search-focused enhancements to the Elasticsearch platform. The goal of this team is to build a high quality, fast, and relevant foundation for search within Elasticsearch. You will participate in roadmap and project planning efforts and will have ownership for delivering it. Youâ€™ll be participating in project management efforts as the teams execute on plans together with the Tech Lead and Product Manager.

Our company is distributed by intention. We hire the best engineers we can find wherever they are, whoever they are. We collaborate across continents every day over email, GitHub, Zoom, and Slack. At our best, we write fast, scalable and intuitive software. We believe that the best way to do that is to empower individual engineers, code review every change, decide big things by consensus, and strive for incremental improvements.

### Engineering philosophy

We believe that engineering complex, pluggable software for the web that is built to last the test of time is both tricky and exciting. Doing so requires a team of diverse individuals, with sharp minds and the ability to empathize with our users, working together with mutual respect and a common mission.

We care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you're working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible throughout our organization. At Elastic, hierarchy does not determine how decisions get made. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on anything, regardless of their role within the company.
