At HubSpot, we have been on an incredible journey building world class CRM, Marketing, Sales, and Services products that help small and medium size businesses grow.

Many of HubSpot's customers start their journey as free users, rather than starting by speaking to our sales team. We are excited to accelerate this touchless business with our Growth Product Group.

The Growth Product Group is an influential team with a big mission. We want to help millions of organisations around the world grow through empowering people to discover, adopt, and buy HubSpotâ€™s products the way they want to. To achieve this, we focus on acquisition, onboarding, retention, and monetisation across the entire HubSpot product platform.

Our Onboarding team strives to deliver the best in-app onboarding experiences to our customers via personalized/templatized hub setup, streamlined wizards, prompt notifications and lots more. Weâ€™re looking for a strong Backend Senior Software Engineer to help us implement vital deliverables.

**As a Senior Engineer on Onboarding, you will:**

  * Write and ship production code that has meaningful and measurable user and business impact
  * Envision, build and analyse new features and tools, each contributing to company growth and revenue
  * Work with a small cross functional team of engineers, PMs, designers, content designers, and researchers
  * Collaborate with HubSpotters all over the company, whether in engineering, product, design, research, marketing, support, etc
  * Help thousands of HubSpot customers meet their goals and grow their companies, stemming from changes youâ€™ve made
  * Implement experiments that give us valuable insights into user behaviour and how to improve their experience
  * Get exposure to how HubSpot works as a business

**You may be a fit if:**

  * You have strong backed development experience. We work with Java, DropWizard and MySQL primarily, but experience with specific technologies is secondary to strong programming fundamentals.
  * You are focused on building efficient and elegant applications and services
  * You not only get excited about big, technical challenges
  * You enjoy being an active member of a small team, contributing to the culture, vision and mission
  * You seek to maintain high standards in both your code and that of your teammates through code reviews, design discussions and monitoring our SLAs
