### Matter Labs  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ Remote,EMEA`  

At Matter Labs, we believe freedom drives progress and prosperity. We donâ€™t see ourselves as a company, but as a team aligned around a single mission: to advance personal freedom for all (see ZK Credo).

  

To achieve this goal, weâ€™re building zkSync â€” a credibly neutral, fully open source technology stack and network on top of Ethereum, which is owned and governed by its community. We use advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum infinitely without compromising on security or decentralization. With a world-class team, a community of over 1M supporters across Twitter + Discord, and hundreds of millions $ in funding, we have abundant resources to accomplish the mission.

Joining a dynamic and collaborative team, you'll have the opportunity to work on exciting projects that push the boundaries of web3 mobile technology.

  

You must be deeply technical, deeply curious, and willing to dive straight into code. Not everything will be perfectly explained or documented, but code is the source of truth and thatâ€™s where we spend our day-to-day.

  * Work closely with UI/UX designers to create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces
  * Conduct code reviews and provide constructive feedback to maintain code quality
  * Participate in the entire app development lifecycle, from concept to delivery

### What We Look For in You

  * Proven experience as an Android Developer, with a strong portfolio of published apps
  * Proficiency in Java and Kotlin, along with a deep understanding of Android frameworks
  * Familiarity with RESTful APIs to connect Android applications to backend services
  * Knowledge of performance optimization techniques and experience with profiling tools
  * Up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in mobile development
  * A strong vision for where the industry is going, and staying on top of new technologies and stacks
  * Passionate and familiar with dApp developers, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology
