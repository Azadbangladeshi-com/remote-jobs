### Job Description

World-class customer service is one of the cornerstones of Wolt üíô Over the years we have invested a lot in our in-house built support tooling. Why? Because we're convinced it's the secret sauce that ensures smiles on the faces of our customers and partners across all 25 countries that we operate in. We take huge pride in our customer operations‚Äô quality, so on top of building delightful support experiences in our consumer app we also aim to uncover and tackle issues before our customers and partners even notice something might be wrong.

The LiveOps team is all about conquering inefficiencies and equipping our support teams across 25 countries with top-notch tools. The team is on a mission to automate the everyday grind, so our teams can focus on delivering an extraordinary customer experience.

One such tool we‚Äôve recently introduced is automated proactive reach-outs for late orders, a game-changer which had a tremendous impact on the efficiency of our customer support. On top of that the team owns SuPi (the Support Inbox), an advanced system that based on heuristics proactively spots customer issues before they even hit the radar. It's like having a crystal ball for customer satisfaction!

So, if you're ready to roll up your sleeves and craft tools that match the same level of quality and passion we dedicate to creating our external solutions, you've found your tribe at Wolt!

üìçThis role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Stockholm, or you can work remotely anywhere in **Finland, Sweden, and Estonia**. Read more about our remote setup here. If you live outside of these countries - not to worry! We provide relocation support to help you make your way to Finland or Sweden.

You're making the right choice by applying if you can drive projects independently, take ownership beyond the obvious, have a strong motivation to learn, and have a track record of collaboration with product teams and fellow team members. Join us on this exciting journey where your skills and unique perspective will play a crucial role in shaping our collective success!
