  * Team player
  * Fluent in English

### Our Culture‚ÄîWho we areü™ê

At Homa, we value brains over backgrounds and determination over degrees. We believe actual growth results from diversity ‚Äî nationalities, backgrounds, skill sets, and personal experiences ‚Äî all working towards a single objective. If you‚Äôve got the smarts, energy, and motivation, no barriers keep you from going far.

We are the people behind the platform - the creative specialists giving creators the data needed to power up their creativity. At Homa, we live by the three central values:

  * Ambition: we put flags on summits. We set our goals ambitiously high and don‚Äôt shy away from the climb. We‚Äôre on a mission to take over an industry thick with incumbents who won‚Äôt go quietly into the night. To succeed here, you‚Äôll need a highly metaphorical shield and a sword.

  * Humility: we put our egos aside. We put our hands up. First to volunteer to help, second to high-five. Having an ego is natural, but letting it run the show is unhelpful to everyone. In the words of Mr. Lamar: Sit down. Be humble.
  * Curiosity: we keep our eyes open. We believe the best way to know anything is to question everything. And to do that, you need open eyes and open minds at all times.

### **Benefits**

  * While success is its own reward, here are some of the benefits that come with working at Homa:
    * We offer essential benefits in France and specific locations, including health insurance, meal vouchers, public transport subsidies, childcare benefits, and life insurance
    * If you're interested in working from our newly renovated Paris HQ with a rooftop garden and WeWork amenities, we have a desk waiting for you
    * You will be working in English with our international team of top-tier talents from 35+ countries
    * You will be able to attend diverse team events and Workations (the famous company-wide Homa trip)
    * You will have quarterly reviews to help you grow within Homa and build your own career path.

### **About Homa**

Homa is a gaming technology lab that gives game creators the data-driven tools and human expertise needed to turn their creative ideas into commercial hits. The technology we create is used by game creators around the world to create games that hit players' sweet spots, and the commercial jackpot.

Our ‚ÄúHoma Lab‚Äù platform gives game creators a comprehensive set of tools and solutions that lets them keep their eyes on new trends and ideas, execute real-time A/B testing of all their game's features through a no-code SDK, and distribute and monetize their games as well. It's a full end-to-end digital ecosystem that ensures developers are focused on the right idea, building games with every feature optimized, and distributing them at the right time, to people eager to play them, worldwide.

Does it work? Yep. Apps powered by our tech have been downloaded more than 1 billion times. And a lot of that is because we don't just sell our platform to clients and wish them well. We partner with them long-term, we make one hit, then we make some more. Homa is 50% a technology platform and 50% a collaborative, transparent partnership.

As a team, we're over 160 people and 34+ nationalities strong. Some of us are artists, some of us are business developers, engineers, entrepreneurs or former strategy consultants ‚Äì but we're all here for the same thing: to take over the gaming industry by giving creators the data to transform their ideas into games played and money made.

  
Since inception, Homa raised a total of $165M to achieve this mission, with the participation of Headline, Northzone, Eurazeo, Singular, Quadrille Capital, Fabric Ventures and Bpifrance - along with renowned business angels, including King and FuboTV founders, and Spotify founder Daniel Ek‚Äôs family office.
