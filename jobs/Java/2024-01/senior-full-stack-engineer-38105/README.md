**Headquarters:** Vienna, Austria

Our mission: **Bring innovation to the patient faster**

  
As regulations of the medical sector become increasingly strict in the European Union, health institutions, such as **hospitals and laboratories struggle to maintain compliance** due to a lack of knowledge and resources. This bears the risk of pushing small laboratories out of business and reducing the overall offering in diagnostics, ultimately resulting in a reduced health care quality for patients.  
  

We at Platomics address this problem by creating products that tap into an existing ecosystem and make complying with a wide range of regulations fast and easy.  
  

Candidates should be prepared to work in a high-cadence environment, collaborating with a highly qualified and international team. Your contributions will directly impact the lives of millions of individuals by ensuring that treatments and laboratory analyses especially for rare diseases can remain available.  
  

We are looking for a **Senior Full Stack Developer with Frontend focus (Angular + Java Spring)** to join us on this journey.

  * Generous salary, depending on your location. As a reference, the salary range for Berlin or Vienna is â‚¬ 70.000 - â‚¬ 95.000 depending on your qualification.

# How we work

  
We are a team of experienced and driven individuals across all disciplines, working remotely from all over Europe.  
  

  
While we are currently in the process to define and shape our team culture collaboratively, we are guided by the following principles:  
  

  
ðŸ”‹ **Its a marathon, not a sprint**

  
We create a work environment that keeps all team members healthy physically and psychologically in the long term. While we work hard, we respect boundaries and take breaks to recharge.

  

  
ðŸ’¬ **Radical candour & psychological safety  
**  

We say what we think and care about each other. We appreciate feedback because this is what lets us grow. We create an environment where every opinion gets heard and valued.  
  

  
ðŸ¥‡ **We reject mediocrity  
**  

We deliver our best work. We care about the results we deliver and own our mistakes. We take calculated risks and ship fast - but we are not sloppy.  
  

ðŸ”¥ **Ideas over hierarchy  
**  

Facts and arguments win, not job titles.
