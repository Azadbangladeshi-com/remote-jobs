### Netflix  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Remote, United States`  

## Description

At Netflix, we want to entertain the world and are constantly innovating on how entertainment is imagined, created, and delivered to a global audience. We currently stream content in more than 30 languages in 190 countries, topping over 260 million paid subscribers, and are expanding into new forms of entertainment such as gaming.

  

Within the Infrastructure Engineering organization, our Data Platform exists to maximize the value of data throughout Netflix by improving the productivity and innovation of Netflix engineers, data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and business users. Our Data Platform enables Netflix to scale effectively and evolve rapidly by providing highly performant, secure, compliant, and flexible data infrastructure that supports the expanding needs of the business. Ultimately, we aim to democratize data by making it more accessible and useful to technical and non-technical employees.

  

 **The Opportunity**

  

The mission of the Data Platformâ€™s GenAI Tools team is to boost the productivity of the data science and engineering community at Netflix. This means enabling users to spend more time solving business problems and less time engineering lower-level systems. We are seeking a senior software engineer to help build a developer platform that will provide the building blocks for Netflix to efficiently create GenAI applications. The platform will enable our teams to leverage LLM models and internally fine-tuned models. It will provide tools to support the LLM development lifecycle, high-level abstraction APIs for RAG, and tools for prompt engineering, management, and LLM operations.
