### Lattice  
#### `ðŸ’° $121,500/yr - $199,500/yr` `ðŸŒŽ SF, NYC, Remote`  

## **This is Engineering at Lattice**

Latticeâ€™s Engineering team is continuously working to better both our product and our craft. We use a modern, cutting-edge tech stack aimed at developer productivity and delight. We strive for maintainable, robust, and performant code. Weâ€™re highly collaborative and continuously iterative and work closely with designers and product managers. We prioritize not only great technical architecture but also an amazing product experience.

## **What You Will Do**

You will build software to help the humans powering organizations thrive, with a focus on integrating AI/ML technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs) and potentially expanding further.

  * You'll work with other engineers to build and own products across a modern tech stack. Our current stack includes NodeJS, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. We rely on AWS to host our infrastructure.
  * You'll design and implement systems to ensure high-quality outputs from non-deterministic AI/ML systems in production.
  * You'll develop and maintain monitoring of evaluation systems for LLM-based applications.
  * You'll assist in debugging and troubleshooting issues in existing applications, ensuring functionality and performance are optimized, with a particular focus on AI/ML components.
  * You will drive the implementation of complex projects, including those that require cross-functional collaboration with product managers and other engineering teams.
  * You will make contributions to our engineering practices, identifying and evangelizing improvements to improve our team output, especially in the context of AI/ML integration.

## **What You Will Bring to the Table**

  * You have 5+ years of professional experience writing and maintaining production-level applications, with at least 2 years of experience working with AI/ML technologies.
  * You have production-level experience writing full stack code in a modern programming language like Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.
  * You have experience implementing and maintaining AI/ML systems in production environments.
  * You are familiar with best practices for deploying and monitoring non-deterministic AI systems in production.
  * You are no stranger to SQL â€” you know how to efficiently model data and write performant queries in a relational database like PostgreSQL.
  * You seek out the root cause when debugging software defects, including those related to AI/ML components, and champion improvements that prevent future issues.
  * You are passionate about clean code, DRY patterns, and high-performance code, both in traditional software engineering and AI/ML contexts.
  * You are clear and concise in explaining your thought process and in enumerating the tradeoffs made in your work, particularly when dealing with AI/ML systems.
  * You have strong communication skills, both verbal and written, and can effectively explain complex AI/ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

## **Nice to Have**

  * Experience with TypeScript
  * Familiarity with React and other frontend technologies
  * Knowledge of AI/ML frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers
  * Experience with cloud-based AI/ML services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI, Azure Machine Learning)
  * Experience with LLMs in production environments
