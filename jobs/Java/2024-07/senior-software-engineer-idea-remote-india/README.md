### OpenTable  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote India`  

With millions of diners, tens of thousands of restaurants, and 23+ years of experience, OpenTable, part of Booking Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: BKNG), is an industry leader with a unique insight into the world of hospitality. We champion restaurants, bars, wineries, and other venues around the world, helping them attract guests, manage capacity, improve operations and maximize revenue.

Every employee at OpenTable has a tangible impact on what we do and how we do it. Youâ€™ll also be part of a global network that includes OpenTable and KAYAK's portfolio of travel brands including Swoodoo, checkfelix, momondo, Cheapflights, Mundi and HotelsCombined.

Hospitality is all about taking care of others, and it defines our culture. Youâ€™ll work in a welcoming and inclusive environment, and get the benefits, flexibility, and support you need to succeed.

 **In this role, you will:**

OpenTable is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the rapidly-growing Restaurant Platform Team in India and help maintain our event-based architecture, data warehouse, data pipelines, reports & insights and APIs. This is a hands-on technical role with a dash of leadership and strategy.

You'll be a key member of a multi-functional team that builds and designs OpenTableâ€™s core reporting insights platform for restaurants globally and will have a substantial impact and involvement on some key enterprise strategies and initiatives. We are passionate about building small, independent product development teams â€“ product managers, designers and engineers working together and empowered to make their own decisions.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for technical and architectural decisions to ensure our platforms are scalable, highly available, reliable and have a dedication, especially under peak traffic spikes.

About You:

An ideal candidate should be an expert in Java and Spring Framework and extra points if you have experience with the technologies behind big data, data pipelines, data warehousing, analytics and designing event-driven, data-intensive architectures.

 **Please apply if:**

We don't believe in checklists, so please apply if some of the following describe you.

  * You consider yourself an expert in Java, Spring framework and Spring Boot, and Hibernate.

  * You have the battle scars from years of working with large-scale, distributed, service-oriented and event-driven architectures and systems, and understand the core principles around observability & monitoring, performance, high availability, scalability, reliability and security.

  * Strong communication and collaboration skills - you enjoy working with engineers, designers and product owners.

  * Good understanding of writing complex SQL queries on tables with hundreds of millions of records and getting results back in sub-second.

  * Experience in several database technologies (e.g. RDBMS like MySQL or Postgres and NoSQL like MongoDB or Cassandra). A really deep understanding of PostgreSQL and ability to confidently fine-tune things under the hood is going to give you a competitive edge.

  * You understand the best ways to build data pipelines to support real time data ingestion and aggregation of millions of events, and can build simple solutions to complex requirements.

  * Experience with Docker / Kubernetes, and message buses like Kafka.

  * You are calm during incidents when debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack.

  * You are a life-long student with a self-motivated desire to build and share your knowledge and skill; you have the ability and desire to mentor as well as be mentored.

  * Knowledge of system performance and operational readiness monitoring.

  * Experience collaborating with remote teams across time zones.

  * Experience working as a full-stack engineer will be an added advantage.

  * Simple intuitive design for complex architectural problems.

  * Resiliency patterns like bulkheads, circuit breakers, fallbacks, and load shedding

 **Benefits:**

  * Paid Vacation

  * One Celebration Day per calendar year

  * Focus on mental health and well-being

  * Company-wide weeks off a year - the whole team fully recharges (and returns without a pile-up of work!)

  * Generous paid parental leave
