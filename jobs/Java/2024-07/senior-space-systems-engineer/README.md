**What Youâ€™ll Do:**

As the Senior Space Systems Engineer, you will play a crucial role in defining and designing technical solutions to address the unique challenges and requirements of applications ranging from space domain awareness, to space education and training, and space intelligence. You will also collaborate closely with engineering, growth, and sales teams, as well as clients and other stakeholders, to develop scalable, robust, and high-performance solutions that translate science based capabilities, rooted in the combined fields of astrodynamics and artificial intelligence, into user-facing data and software products that meet or exceed customer expectations.

**Position Responsibilities:**

  * Lead the design and architecture of technical solutions for space domain applications, leveraging your deep understanding of systems, databases, networking, and software development principles. Analyze and define functional, non-functional, and business requirements to inform solution designs.

  * Provide technical leadership and guidance to multi-disciplinary delivery teams throughout the solution development lifecycle. Prioritize tasks, set project goals, and ensure that projects are delivered according to the roadmap, on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

  * Engage with clients, vendors, and internal stakeholders to understand the customerâ€™s technical requirements and distill those into functional requirements the broader delivery team can use as a blueprint for the capability required. 

  * Conduct workshops, presentations, and demonstrations to showcase proposed architectures and gain stakeholder buy-in.

  * Identify potential technical risks and challenges associated with solution development and implementation. Develop strategies to mitigate risks effectively and ensure the successful delivery of projects.

  * Work closely with the Slingshot product team to shape the technical roadmap and vision for solution development, outlining key milestones, dependencies, and deliverables. 

  * Hold combined development teams accountable for meeting technical objectives and provide regular updates to management.

  * Seamlessly communicate technical progress, challenges, and achievements to customers, management, and other stakeholders through clear and concise technical writing, presentations, and reports. Foster a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement within the engineering organization.

  * Support the growth and product teams in solution making activities, and in drafting technical content relevant to new business capture opportunities, requests for information (RFIs), requests for quote (RFQs), white papers, presentations, and customer briefings.

  * Execute all position responsibilities in alignment with Slingshotâ€™s core values, mission, and purpose.

  * Form trusted working relationships with customers, end users, business partners, and fellow Slingshooters.

**Pre-Requisites**

  * Must have an active DoD TS/SCI security clearance

**Minimum Requirements**

  * Advanced degree (M.S. or Ph.D.) in Aerospace Engineering with a strong focus on astrodynamics modeling and simulation, space systems, or model based systems engineering.

  * 10+years of experience in senior engineering technical leadership roles, preferably in the space industry.

  * Strong technical expertise in systems engineering and software development.

  * Proficiency in project management methodologies (e.g. Agile, Scrum, Kanban).

  * Demonstrated ability to develop and execute technical roadmaps, manage project risks, and drive results in a fast-paced environment.

  * Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to communicate technical concepts effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

  * Deeply experienced with technical writing, presentation skills, and stakeholder engagement.

  * Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think critically and analytically.

  * Proven track record of delivering complex technical projects on time and within budget.

**Preferred Skills**

  * Demonstrated work experience in space flight applications.

  * Experience in product development.

  * Highly skilled in leading technical teams of diverse expertise.
