****The role:****

Our EU engineering team is growing, and we're looking for first Senior Android Engineer in the EU, whoâ€™ll help us build amazing experiences for millions of our diners across the world.

We're searching for a product-aware engineer passionate about great UI and UX to join our team. You understand the need for engineering excellence with tested, resilient code balanced against the need to move fast and iterate.

You'll be part of the team that helps restaurants of all sizes thrive by creating experiences that make diners come back time time after time to find and book the perfect table for every occasion. We'd love you to join our team and help shape the roadmap for our products!

This role is all about collaborating across teams to make a difference for customers.

As an Android engineer at OpenTable, youâ€™ll work in a small product squad alongside Web Engineers, Product Designers, Product Managers, QA Testers, and Data Scientists.

You'll report to an engineering manager, and their mission is to help you develop and grow as an engineer.

  * Scale the app and take ownership of technical improvements/roadmap

  * Craft elegant and practical user interfaces for discovering restaurants on our global app

  * Develop experiences for millions of diners and make it easy for them to discover the perfect dining occasions.

  * Improve yourself and the team by learning new skills and sharing your knowledge with others.

  * Create a better product by voicing your opinions on how and why we do what we do.

  * Use data insights and leverage A/B tests heavily to validate our products, allowing us to test and iterate quickly

  * You are comfortable working with both Android and server-side code (we own the services that power our app, written in Java)

  * You have experience with building and maintaining a scalable, modern and performant Android app

  * You value testing as a way to ensure a great user experience

  * You possess an appetite for continually refining and improving the end-user experience as well as the developer experience

Not everyone knows everything in our teams; we don't expect you to either. You'll be encouraged to learn on the job, and we have two dedicated days at the end of our sprints for people to explore, learn and be creative.

**Interview process**

We know that interviewing is a two-way process, and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us as much as we are getting to know you!

Our interviews are conversational, and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious.

**You can expect the process below, following a chat with one of our Talent Team:**

  * **Initial phone call with the Engineering manager:** ~45 minutes

  * **Technical interview:** ~45 minutes

  * **Final Stage Hiring Manager and Senior Leader Interview:** ~75 minutes

****How you'll work****

OpenTable teams are independent and come up with their way of working. In our team, we use two-week sprints to prioritise and drive work. Within this team, we are spread across the UK and work remotely for the majority of our time. We meet once a month in our London office to have lunch, collaborate and create bonds. We have regular team offsite events. Our last one was cocktail making and tapas in March 2024.

We have a flexible approach to office and home working, trusting you to find the right balance of productivity and face-to-face collaboration. If you want in-person collaboration or to see a familiar face in person, we have a fully operational dog friendly office with free lunches, massages and all the vital equipment to be productive.

Enjoying what you do and progressing in your career is important to us. Not everyone wants to be a manager, so OpenTable has parallel tracks for technical and management roles, which you can switch between when it suits you.

****What to expect****

OpenTable engineers come from a diverse group of backgrounds, and we believe that a team with a broad set of experiences produces amazing results. You do not have to have a computer science degree; in fact, several of us have social science degrees or no degree at all. We are a diverse team and genuinely believe that representation matters.

You'll regularly work with our development teams worldwide, from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Kaunas, Mumbai, Berlin, and Melbourne.

Base part: from â‚¬60,000 EUR Gross - up to â‚¬65,000 EUR Gross, depending on the experience.

****Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion****

OpenTable aspires to be a workplace that reflects the diverse communities we serve and a culture that is inclusive and welcoming. Hiring people with different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and ideas is critical to innovation and to how we deliver great experiences for our users and our partners. Representation matters.
