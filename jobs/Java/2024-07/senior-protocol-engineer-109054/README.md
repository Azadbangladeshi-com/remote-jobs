### Consensys  
#### `ðŸŒŽ APAC - Remote`  

Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About Protocols**

Within Consensys, the Protocols team has a range of products and projects that support the Ethereum ecosystem. Alongside Java open-source communities, we are continuing to develop Ethereum core clients Hyperledger Besu (execution client) and Teku (consensus client).

Besu and Teku can be used separately or together to participate in Ethereum Mainnet, and are increasingly used by solo and institutional stakers alike. Teku contains a full beacon node implementation and a validator client for participating in proof of stake consensus, while Besu provides the transaction execution layer and state management.

Besu and Teku teams are both looking for a **Senior Blockchain Protocol Engineer**!

**What youâ€™ll do**

As a **Senior Blockchain Protocol Engineer** , you'll be part of a tight-knit team helping build the future of Ethereum, based on core blockchain technologies. Using Java, you will help design distributed systems and develop large scale, highly available software. As an Ethereum core developer, you will collaborate with the global Ethereum community, including researchers, engineers and product owners from a variety of teams within the ecosystem. You will play a key role in building next-generation networks. This role is an opportunity to learn and improve, as part of a talented team, with plenty of challenges in a rapidly developing technology.

**Would be great if you brought this to the role**

  * Strong Java programming skills
  * Understanding of object-oriented design principles
  * Knowledge of blockchain technology
  * Interest in applied cryptography
  * Collaborative by nature; willing to give and receive feedback
  * Good verbal and written communication skills in English to engage with your team and stakeholders effectively

Weâ€™re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and, as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environmentâ€”apply anyway.
