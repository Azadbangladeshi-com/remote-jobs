###  **Job Description**

At Currencycloud you can work from home, or visit our plush offices in London, Cardiff or Amsterdam! You'll need to be based in either the UK or Netherlands for this role, and have the necessary work permissions.

Currencycloud was acquired by Visa in December 2021. Our **Engineering Managers** lead the engineers that are responsible for implementing an industry-leading API that has already processed over USD50 billion of cross-border transactions for over 5 million end-users, and is available to our clients 24x7.

We follow the principle of having small autonomous teams that are owners of their future. The Engineering Manager is responsible for all engineers in a team, including both Software and Quality engineers.

If you follow Pat Kua and his 5 Engineering Manager Archetypes, we see our role in between the Tech Lead Manager and the Team Lead Manager. We believe that our managers must have a technical background to have productive conversations with our engineers, but we donâ€™t expect them to be coding all the time.

Our usual team structure consists of an Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Agile Delivery Manager, 3 to 4 Software Engineers and 1 to 2 QA Engineers.

As we grow, we started grouping teams into tribes, following a version of the Spotify model. Tribes are a number of teams working under the same domain, where interactions between teams (and their services), although autonomous, are tighter than teams/services outside the tribe.
