### Block  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote,San Francisco, CA`  

### **Company Description**

Block is one company built from many blocks, all united by the same purpose of economic empowerment. The blocks that form our foundational teams â€” People, Finance, Counsel, Hardware, Information Security, Platform Infrastructure Engineering, and more â€” provide support and guidance at the corporate level. They work across business groups and around the globe, spanning time zones and disciplines to develop inclusive People policies, forecast finances, give legal counsel, safeguard systems, nurture new initiatives, and more. Every challenge creates possibilities, and we need different perspectives to see them all. Bring yours to Block.

###  **Job Description**

The Privacy Engineering team was formed to build tools and provide guidance for engineering teams to collect, store, and analyze data responsibly. Security and privacy are closely linked, but where security focuses on the meta level of protecting data and assets as a whole, privacy zooms in to focus on the type of information collected, stored, and used, and how that information may violate expectations or breach trust. Privacy Engineering provides technology and abstraction layers to enable the employees at Block to do their job while being customer-centric and minimizing risks to the individual.

Privacy Engineering aims to be a resource and enabler of responsible data use, not a gatekeeper. Our technological solutions are designed to make the most common data use cases easier for the employees at Block, but not to restrict or exclude uncommon data use cases that are responsible and compliant. We promote privacy enhancing technologies. Working with other teams within security, engineering, and legal, we set reasonable expectations for anyone looking to build systems or products at Block.

As a Senior Software Engineer on the team at Block, you will build internal products and infrastructure to protect Blockâ€™s customersâ€™ privacy and collaborate with many teams across Block, including product engineering teams, privacy counsel, and teams within security and platform engineering.

  * Help define the technological future of privacy at Block
  * Collaborate with other engineering teams incorporating privacy engineering products into their engineered solutions
  * Provide mentorship and reviews for engineering teams working with privacy technologies
  * Contribute to the monitoring and stability of our teamâ€™s existing engineering solutions
