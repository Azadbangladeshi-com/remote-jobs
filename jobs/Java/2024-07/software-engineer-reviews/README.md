## **What You Will Do**

This is an opportunity to work on Lattice's flagship Performance Reviews product and everything that comes with it. Recently we have launched a new Promotions product that is currently in Beta, new Review Cycle analytics together with the analytics team, and we are also starting work on a new greenfield PiP product.

  * Youâ€™ll participate in code reviews and testing processes to ensure high-quality software deliverables and improve your coding skills.
  * Youâ€™ll contribute to project documentation and maintain technical documentation for reference and reporting purposes.
  * You will make contributions to our engineering practices, identifying and evangelizing improvements to improve our team output.

## **What You Will Bring to the Table**

You have 2+ years of professional experience writing and maintaining production-level applications.

  * You have production-level experience writing full stack JavaScript / Typescript, and are well versed in frameworks such as React, Relay, Next.js and GraphQL.
  * You are no stranger to SQL â€” you know how to efficiently model data and write performant queries in a relational database like PostgreSQL.
  * You seek out the root cause when debugging software defects, and champion improvements that prevent future issues.
  * You are passionate about clean code, DRY patterns, and high-performance code.
  * You are clear and concise in explaining your thought process and in enumerating the tradeoffs made in your work.
