**About the role:**

As a Manufacturing Quality Engineer, you will spearhead our mission to uphold unparalleled production quality standards across our diverse product range. This paramount role requires an exceptional leader capable of autonomously developing and implementing a comprehensive Quality Management System (QMS) that is not only industry-leading but also adaptable to our unique product portfolio. You will work closely yet independently with product development, manufacturing, and supply chain teams, ensuring all products exceed our stringent quality criteria and performance expectations. Your success in this role hinges on your ability to command respect, foster alignment, and navigate the complexities of working with contract manufacturing partners to achieve our product quality objectives.

**You should apply if:**

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** Your efforts will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, reduce emissions, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  * **You are the architect of your own career:** If you put in the work, this role wonâ€™t be your last at Samsara. We set up our employees for success and have built a culture that encourages rapid career development, and countless opportunities to experiment and master your craft in a hyper-growth environment.

  * **You want to be with the best:** At Samsara, we win together, celebrate together and support each other. You will be surrounded by a high-caliber team that will encourage you to do your best. 

**In this role, you will:**

  * Oversee the entire spectrum of component quality management, from concept to end-of-life, guaranteeing adherence to rigorous quality and reliability standards. This includes understanding manufacturing limitations and setting appropriate quality benchmarks.
  * Lead the definition of quality requirements for critical mechanical and electromechanical components.
  * Develop and align quality control standards and metrology practices to meet product specifications, in partnership with final assembly manufacturing partners and strategic sub-tier suppliers to ensure uniformity and precision.
  * Utilize advanced analytics for a thorough examination of production data, identifying avenues for product performance enhancement and cost optimization. Employ predictive modeling techniques to identify potential issues proactively before they arise.
  * Coordinate Failure Analysis (FA) initiatives, pinpointing the root causes of component failures and leading corrective actions using the 5-Why analysis. Facilitate FA processes with suppliers to share insights and preventive strategies.
  * Conduct comprehensive quality audits at supplier sites, confirming compliance with established quality protocols.
  * Evaluate and bring up new component suppliers, managing the qualification journey from tool design and production readiness to comprehensive system validation, ensuring suppliers meet Samsaraâ€™s stringent quality requirements.
  * Monitor supplier adherence to new product introduction schedules, ensuring a seamless and stable transition to mass production volumes, and meeting product launch timelines.
  * Champion a culture of continuous improvement with suppliers, monitoring Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track progress and drive enhancements in quality and reliability.
  * Champion, role model, and embed Samsaraâ€™s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices.

**Minimum requirements for the role:**

  * BS in Quality Management, Engineering, or a related field, demonstrating a profound understanding of quality standards and methodologies.
  * Minimum of 8-10 years of experience in manufacturing quality management, with a strong preference for backgrounds in high-volume production environments, shipping RF/power/optical-based electronics products in industrial and heavy-duty applications.
  * Strong knowledge of quality standards (e.g., ISO 9001, Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing) and regulatory requirements, with a track record of applying these in complex manufacturing environments.
  * Exceptional leadership qualities, with the ability to operate independently, make strategic decisions, and influence cross-functional teams and external partners toward achieving quality objectives.
  * Superior analytical and problem-solving skills, capable of conducting sophisticated data analysis to drive quality improvements and cost efficiencies.
  * Ability to travel internationally, depending on project needs.
