  * Be a strategic partner with engineering, product, and cross functional leadership in designing, developing and scaling digital advertising features that drive revenue growth and enhance user engagement.
  * Own projects end to end â€” youâ€™ll be responsible for working with Product and other stakeholders to refine requirements, creating technical designs and specs, implementing changes, and seeing projects through to launch and maintenance.
