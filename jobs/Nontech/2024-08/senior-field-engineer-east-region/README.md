Dataiku is looking for an experienced Architect to join its Field Engineering Team as a Sr Field Engineer. This position will support the deployment of Dataikuâ€™s Everyday AI Platform to an ever growing customer base in the East region.

This role requires strong technical abilities, adaptability, inventiveness, business acumen, and strong communication skills.

  * Drive technical success by being a trusted advisor to our prospects and our internal account teams to provide the best recommendations and advance customer accounts.
  * Troubleshoot complex customer issues when necessary.

  * Strong Linux system administration experience.
  * Hands-on experience with the Kubernetes ecosystem for setup, administration, troubleshooting, and tuning.
  * Experience with cloud based services like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

  * Familiarity with Ansible or other application deployment tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc).

**Location: Must be currently located on the East Coast of the United States.**
