With our growing customer base and our expansion into new markets and use cases, we have more to build than ever at Affinity as we execute on our vision to put relationship intelligence at every professional's fingertips.

As a **Senior Software Engineer** on the **CRM Team** , youâ€™ll have the opportunity to evolve the implementation of the spreadsheet-like interfaces that are core to how our users manage and view their data in the application. This is a particularly complex domain because the data modeling needs to be extremely flexible to support unique use cases. Youâ€™ll also guide the future of the new automations offering, which enables configuring workflows to manipulate data using if-this-then-that rules.

Additionally, this team owns:

  * Relationship Intelligence, including the calculation and surfacing of relationship strengths between people based on ingested datasets
  * The embedded Analytics platform that provides customizable data visualizations
  * Search, notifications, and reminders functionality

**In this role, you will:**

  * Write code at all levels of the stack in the above product areas, with a preference for backend development
  * Act as a Tech Lead for large projects, which involves collaborating closely with product to define the project scope and milestones, defining the technical direction, decomposing work to distribute across the team, and being accountable for outcomes
  * Mentor other engineers to uplevel them individually and the team as a whole
  * Collaborate across team boundaries to align on and coordinate change, as this team manages data models that have touchpoints upstream and downstream
  * Identify areas for technical investment and advocate to prioritize that work amongst ongoing projects
  * Promote operational excellence with focus on high reliability, performance, and scalability

**Qualifications:**

Donâ€™t meet every single requirement? Studies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every qualification. At Affinity, we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace, so if youâ€™re excited about this role, but your past experience doesnâ€™t perfectly align with the qualifications above, we encourage you to apply anyways. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

  * You have ~7+ years of experience in software engineering, with at least 2+ years of experience as a senior member of a team delivering end-to-end systems
  * Youâ€™re **proficient in Ruby and modern OOD**
  * Youâ€™re comfortable troubleshooting across network, application, caching, queuing, and storage layers
  * You know how to diagnose and improve performance issues systematically
  * You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time
  * You demonstrate strong ownership instincts and sweat the details
  * You have strong convictions, weakly held, and assume validation and iteration are a given to produce the best results
  * Youâ€™re excited to work on a cross-functional team, partnering with product stakeholders, other teams, and subject matter experts

**Nice to have:**

  * A combination of startup and brand-name SaaS companies experience
  * Experience with event-driven architecture and Kafka
  * Experience with React and Typescript

**Tech stack:**

Our platform is built with React and TypeScript on the front end, with Ruby and PostgreSQL on the back end. Weâ€™re leaning into event-driven architecture using Kafka. Our infrastructure is hosted by AWS and runs on Kubernetes.

**How we work:**

Our culture is a key part of how we operate as well as our hiring process:

  * We iterate quickly. As such, you must be comfortable embracing ambiguity, be able to cut through it, and deliver incremental value to our customers each sprint.
  * We are candid, transparent, and speak our minds while simultaneously caring personally with each person we interact with. 
  * We make data-driven decisions and make the best decision for the moment based on the information available.
