  * Be a strategic partner with engineering, product, and cross functional leadership in designing, developing and scaling digital advertising features that drive revenue growth and enhance user engagement.
  * Architect elegant and maintainable code with focus on autonomy and support from the team. Uphold a high product and technical quality bar while quickly launching and iterating on features. Introduce coding and operational best practices to the team; always be learning & teaching.
