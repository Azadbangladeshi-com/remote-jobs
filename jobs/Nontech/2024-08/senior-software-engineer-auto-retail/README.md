**The Team**

Join us to help fix that, and make a big impact in one of the worldâ€™s largest industries.**

As a Senior Software Engineer on the Auto Retail team at Upstart, you will work closely with cross-functional partners to execute projects across the whole stack. Youâ€™re a self-starter who delivers work with quality, testability, resiliency, and maintainability in mind. Youâ€™ll move efficiently and deliberately to drive both existing and greenfield projects forward, while always keeping our end users in mind.

**How youâ€™ll make an impact:**

  * Lead successful projects working collaboratively with engineering team members and cross-functional partners
  * Make thoughtful architectural decisions to improve the quality of our software
  * Translate complex business requirements into technical plans, and ultimately high quality code
  * Drive a culture of technical excellence

    * Experience deploying web applications on Vercel and/or with NextJS

**Travel requirements** As a digital first company, the majority of your work can be accomplished remotely. The majority of our employees can live and work anywhere in the U.S but are encouraged to to still spend high quality time in-person collaborating via regular onsites. The in-person sessionsâ€™ cadence varies depending on the team and role; most teams meet once or twice per quarter for 2-4 consecutive days at a time.

**What you'll love:**

  * Competitive Compensation (base + bonus & equity)
  * Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage with Health Savings Account contributions from Upstart
