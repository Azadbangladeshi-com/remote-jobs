# [Software Engineer - Backend (E5)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-backend-e5-110659)  
### Fountain  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom (Remote)`  

**Position Overview:**

As a Software Engineer - Backend in the Fountain Worker Experience team, you will be part of a dedicated product team of developers working throughout the entire product cycle, which includes planning, architecture, development, and maintenance of the Fountain products. To do so, you will receive support from product managers, designers, and other software engineers.

To succeed in this position, it is important to have a proven track record of working with rich enterprise products and a solid technical background in backend development, data structures, and architecture. A high level of autonomy and the ability to work well as a team in a remote setting will be crucial for success in this role.

The Worker Experience team is organized into product squads, each responsible for independently developing new products using a product-led growth approach. New products are released every quarter, with a focus on product-based software development. It is important that you are comfortable with this approach.

We are a rapidly growing team and product within Fountain that operates with agility and speed. You will be expected to make decisions even when faced with uncertainty, and you will have the freedom to do so. In fact, you will operate with the autonomy typically found in early-stage product development, rather than in a larger organization.

This role requires collaboration within a globally distributed organization, spanning different time zones, continents, and cultures (including Western and Northern Europe, USA, South Africa, India, and more).

**What you'll be doing** :

  * Plan and take responsibility for delivering your product
  * Design, develop, test, and maintain product features
  * Collaborate to enhance core stack technologies and architecture
  * Review and collaborate with other developers' work
  * Ensure the quality, reliability, operations, and security of your product
  * Collaborate closely with the product team throughout the product life cycle
  * Implement and maintain the stack using best practices and current pragmatic boundaries
  * Provide clear reports on your product scope, planning, and team members to your superiors

**What you should bring** :

  * 5+ years of experience in software engineering
  * Demonstrated experience in product-oriented software development
  * Strong technical expertise in software development and architecture, TypeScript, and cloud-first solutions
  * Ability to work independently and confidently, even in dynamic situations and with limited information
  * Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, in English, to facilitate effective collaboration with the team. Proficiency in French is also highly regarded

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience in B2B SaaS startup environments and remote international settings is strongly preferred
  * Familiarity with event-driven architectures, serverless architectures, high volume architectures, API strategies, MongoDB, AWS, micro-services, web security, and Agile methods is highly desirable

**Location:** You will work remotely
