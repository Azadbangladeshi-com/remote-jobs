## Description

We‚Äôre helping organizations deploy supergraphs at scale using Apollo Federation. Are you passionate about language engineering and understand what it takes to write a compiler or a query planner? If so, we‚Äôd love to talk to you about joining us in building next-generation GraphQL infrastructure.

  

With more and more GraphQL APIs being deployed by product teams in organizations, building and organizing subgraphs into a supergraph is crucial in helping engineers quickly build new apps. In this role, you‚Äôll critically impact architecting new query language features. You will lead initiatives and collaborate with other developers, partnering with your engineering manager, product, design, and others to deliver best-in-class products that span our entire platform. You‚Äôll work with talented folks who value code that is 80% of the value for 20% of the work, designs that are forward-thinking enough to be easily flexible for the next features and lead through ambiguity with a healthy dose of mindfulness and humility. You‚Äôll help them grow and they‚Äôll help you.

  

Apollo is the worldwide leader of GraphQL innovation. Companies like Netflix, Expedia, Peloton, DoorDash, The New York Times, and Zillow are just a small sample of Apollo's customers. Our open-source product has millions of downloads every week. Gartner estimates that by 2025, 50% of companies will be using GraphQL, and we're the clear market leader.

  

GraphQL is transforming the software development space by creating a brand new layer in companies' stacks called the supergraph that helps engineering teams ship faster and build richer experiences than ever before. Join us and build the future of Apollo‚Äôs Graph Management Plane!
