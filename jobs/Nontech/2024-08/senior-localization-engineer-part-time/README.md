#  **Our Story**

Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasnâ€™t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need â€“ LILT.

At its core, LILT has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didnâ€™t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.

 _LILT is an equal opportunity employer. We extend equal opportunity to all individuals without regard to an individualâ€™s race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic characteristics, veteran or marital status, pregnancy, or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal laws.
