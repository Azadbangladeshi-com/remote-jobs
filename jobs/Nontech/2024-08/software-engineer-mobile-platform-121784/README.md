**About the role:**

The Mobile Platform team owns the frameworks and tooling that enable other developers at Samsara to build and deploy mobile applications for our customers. Our apps are used by over 100k daily active users and weâ€™re excited to work towards growing that number to 1M DAU. Our team builds and maintains a variety of infrastructure including reusable UX components and design systems, SDKs, continuous integration systems, monitoring tools, and networking and persistence layer frameworks. The systems we own are leveraged across multiple applications and business units and impact teams across the company.

We use React Native, Typescript, Redux, and GraphQL for our mobile apps, and Golang for our backend. This position can be office-based or fully remote.

This role is open to candidates residing in the US and Canada except the San Francisco Bay Area (125 mi. radius from 1 De Haro St, San Francisco) and NYC Metro Area (50 mi. radius from 131 W 55th St, New York).

**You should apply if:**

  * **You want to impact the industries that run our world:** The software, firmware, and hardware you build will result in real-world impactâ€”helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.
  * **You want to build for scale:** With over 2.3 million IoT devices deployed to our global customers, you will work on a range of new and mature technologies driving scalable innovation for customers across industries driving the world's physical operations.
  * **You are a life-long learner:** We have ambitious goals. Every Samsarian has a growth mindset as we work with a wide range of technologies, challenges, and customers that push us to learn on the go.
  * **You believe customers are more than a number:** Samsara engineers enjoy a rare closeness to the end user and you will have the opportunity to participate in customer interviews, collaborate with customer success and product managers, and use metrics to ensure our work is translating into better customer outcomes.
  * **You are a team player:** Working on our Samsara Engineering teams requires a mix of independent effort and collaboration. Motivated by our mission, weâ€™re all racing toward our connected operations vision, and we intend to winâ€”together.

**In this role, you will:**

  * Propose, design, implement, and document shared components/frameworks for use across multiple applications within our ecosystem.
  * Consult with and mentor other engineering teams to guide them through mobile-specific concerns as they plan and build customer-facing features.
  * Ensure a top-quality developer experience by improving the reliability and usability of our continuous integration, metrics collection, and mobile build systems.
  * Champion, role model, and embed Samsaraâ€™s cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices.

**Minimum requirements for the role:**

  * Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/Engineering or equivalent practical experience.
  * 2+ years of relevant industry experience in software development.
  * An interest in growing and developing as a software engineer.
  * Professional experience working with a team to develop software.

**An ideal candidate also has:**

  * 1+ years of experience on mobile- or platform-focused teams.
  * Has experience using Redux or similar state management frameworks.
  * Enjoys thinking about systems - their life cycles, edge cases, interactions, and failure modes.
