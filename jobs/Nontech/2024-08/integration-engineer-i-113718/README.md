 **Who We Are:**

Aledade, a public benefit corporation, exists to empower the most transformational part of our health care landscape - independent primary care.

Our work strengthens continuity of care, aligns incentives, and ensures primary care physicians are paid for what they do best - keeping patients healthy.
