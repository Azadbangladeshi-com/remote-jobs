The Account Abstractions team is focused on making it fast and easy for our users to build powerful and flexible integrations. We are building next generation APIs and UIs that give flexibility to our users in terms of their user representations.

## **What youâ€™ll do**

Backend Engineers on the team will design and build end-to-end features fundamental to the onboarding and management experience of every Connect user, including Stripeâ€™s largest Connect users with complex integrations. We are seeking engineers who are excited to develop features for these foundations as well as their higher-level dashboard surfaces, delivering best-in-class product experiences for our users.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Design, build, and maintain high-performance APIs, services, and systems across Stripeâ€™s engineering teams
  * Solve problems end-to-end across a variety of systems and services, in close collaboration with other engineers on your team 
  * Collaborate with cross-functional partner teams to deliver delightful developer experiences and comprehensive interfaces with core account and money movement primitives
  * Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
  * Work with engineers across the company to build new features at large-scale
  * Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes

## **Who you are**

Weâ€™re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

### **Minimum requirements**

  * Strong technical background, including 2+ years of experience as a backend engineer, with an affinity for building scalable backend infrastructure.
  * Experience delivering, extending, and maintaining large scale distributed systems.
  * The skills to build holistically â€“ from specs and documentation to implementation, testing, deployment, and measuring impact
  * Ability to work well cross-functionally and earn trust from colleagues at all levels
  * Think about systems and services and write high quality code. We work mostly in Ruby, with some Scala and Go. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.
  * You hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
  * Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.
  * Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts
  * Enjoy working with a diverse group of people with different expertise (for example, Â¼ of Stripes work in a country thatâ€™s different from the one they grew up in).
  * Almost every role at Stripe collaborates with some engineers, from Sales and Support in sharing feedback from our customers; to Legal and Accounting in supporting our systems for tracking money movement and reporting around the world.

### **Preferred qualifications**

  * Propensity to ask questions, assume good intentions, and defaulting to transparency
  * You hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
  * You think of yourself as entrepreneurial and enjoy moving quickly on new, green-field products.
