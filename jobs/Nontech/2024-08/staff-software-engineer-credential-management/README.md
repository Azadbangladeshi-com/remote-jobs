**Why Mozilla?**

Mozilla Corporation is the non-profit-backed technology company that has shaped the internet for the better over the last 25 years. We make pioneering brands like Firefox, the privacy-minded web browser, and Pocket, a service for keeping up with the best content online. Now, with more than 225 million people around the world using our products each month, weâ€™re shaping the next 25 years of technology and helping to reclaim an internet built for people, not companies. Our work focuses on diverse areas including AI, social media, security and more. And weâ€™re doing this while never losing our focus on our core mission â€“ to make the internet better for people.

The Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the non-profit 501(c) Mozilla Foundation. This means we arenâ€™t beholden to any shareholders â€” only to our mission. Along with thousands of volunteer contributors and collaborators all over the world, Mozillians design, build and distribute **open-source** software that enables people to enjoy the internet on their terms.

**What is a Staff Software Engineer at Mozilla?**

A Staff Software Engineer is the next level from a Senior Software Engineer. At Mozilla this role can vary but typically a Staff Engineer is a domain expert who leads others within a single team to tackle multi-month projects. They sequence deliverables and manage risks in their team's projects, provide feedback on our strategy and goals affecting the team, and turn our strategy into action for their team members. Staff Software Engineers mentor others by stewarding some responsibilities to more junior and senior engineers so they can take on new ones. They collaborate with management on building team consensus and providing direction. Staff Software Engineers identify gaps and opportunities for improvement to enable a culture of inclusion and allyship, at all levels of the organization.
