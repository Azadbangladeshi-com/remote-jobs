#### `ðŸ’° USD $234,000~$300,000` `ðŸŒŽ New York, New York, USA; Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Denver, Colorado, USA; New York, USA, Remote; Massachusetts, USA, Remote; Colorado, USA, Remote`  

We are looking for a Staff Engineer to help us design, build, and ship our next generation of cloud provider management.

At Datadog we have grown to operate across a wide range of providers, regions, and regulatory environments. With this growth, we have pushed our existing tooling and processes for managing cloud provider accounts and resources to its limits. As we continue to evolve, our approach to managing resources and accounts must too. This evolution will be squarely in the critical path for enabling larger efforts.

Weâ€™re just starting to figure out how we can both address these existing concerns and set up Datadog engineering teams for success as we drive towards future phases of growth. As a Staff Engineer, you will play a critical role in guiding the team through this transition, making major technical and operational decisions, and growing the engineers around you.

This role is also unique in that you will get to operate and interact across nearly every engineering team at Datadog while also being directly involved in high level, strategic discussions with all of the major cloud providers.

_At Datadog, we value our office culture â€“ the relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity it brings. We operate as a hybrid workplace to ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best fits them._

**What You'll Do:**

  * Design and drive high-priority, high-visibility projects to increase the platform's value, resilience, and scalability across multiple teams.

  * Provide technical leadership across one or several areas of the platform.

  * Lead and guide other engineers through architectural platform decisions.

  * Identify potential system risks and trends in reliability and design solutions to address them.

  * Provide input on prioritizing engineering-led initiatives in short- and long-term planning and roadmaps.

  * Collaborate with internal product teams to understand their requirements and how we can help them continue to rapidly ship new products and features while maintaining a high bar for security, reliability, and scalability.

**Who You Are:**

  * You have led cross-team initiatives in a platform or infrastructure-focused environment for several years.

  * You have led impactful technical initiatives in an environment where performance, cost efficiency, ease of use, and resilience/operability are first-order concerns.

  * You have significant back-end programming experience and have architected, built, and operated distributed systems to solve problems at a high scale.

  * You enjoy mentoring and coaching other engineers to become even stronger.

  * You have a BS/MS/PhD in a Computer Science, Engineering or related scientific field or equivalent experience

_Datadog values people from all walks of life. We understand not everyone will meet all the above qualifications on day one. That's okay. If youâ€™re passionate about technology and want to grow your skills, we encourage you to apply._

**Benefits and Growth:**

  * New hire stock equity (RSUs) and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)

  * Continuous professional development, product training, and career pathing

  * Intradepartmental mentor and buddy program for in-house networking

  * An inclusive company culture, ability to join our Community Guilds (Datadog employee resource groups)
