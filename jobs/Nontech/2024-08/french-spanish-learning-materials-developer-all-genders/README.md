 **Your mission with us:**

You will help continuously improve and expand Lingoda's range of courses for foreign professionals by creating curricula and teaching/learning materials in both French and Spanish for use in the classroom and for self-study.

  

### Your tasks:

* You will be responsible for the creation, upkeep and improvements of both our French and our Spanish curricula (you will be able to move seamlessly across both languages, understanding the nuances of creating materials for students of both, at all levels).
* Putting your didactic knowledge into practice: You will create differentiated, well-designed lessons and exercises that implement our learning principles and ensure effective, modern language learning.
* Ensure that our lessons are error-free: You will correct any language, style and layout errors that you find in our learning materials. You will also ensure that the language is adapted to the level of the participants.
* Writing texts for language learners: You will write high-quality texts that make the use of a particular language clear and are, of course, memorable and entertaining!
* Create entertaining interactive exercises: With the help of didactic software, you will create well thought-out homework assignments so that our participants can practise what they have learnt in class on their own. 
* In addition, you will support your colleagues working across other Lingoda languages on ideas for, and execution of, new Digital Education projects.

  

### You bring to Lingoda

* You speak both French and Spanish at native level (C2).
* Your English is very good (C1+). Our corporate language is English.
* You have worked as a language teacher for at least 1 year. The longer, the better!
* You are very familiar with the requirements of the CEFR for both French and Spanish.
* You have a Bachelor's degree related to languages (linguistics, philology, etc.).
* You have experience in creating language content in French and Spanish.

  

### Additional points for:

* Having used AI in language content creation and understanding a little about how to write the best prompts.
* Experience in the editing industry, especially if you have worked on language learning books.
* Any kind of formal proofreading experience.

  

### You add to our culture with:

* You are a grammar expert, know the rules, peculiarities and nuances of the use of each French and Spanish grammar topic and can easily make suggestions for improvement. You always understand why a word works or doesn't work in a particular sentence and are a master in the art of comma and punctuation. 
* You adhere to deadlines, are a team player, learn quickly and can also work well independently. 
* You work with a high degree of accuracy and flexibility. You are able to think creatively when faced with a new task and proactively offer suggestions on how best to complete it.
* Your proofreading skills are extremely strong: You spot every typo, inconsistency, punctuation error, ambiguity, incorrect formatting, wrong word choice or overly wordy sentences.
* You are an excellent writer: you have the ability to create a text that fulfils some technical requirements (such as level adaptation and relevance to a topic) and yet is so entertaining and memorable that students will remember it for years to come.
* You consider yourself to be a real language enthusiast and you want to work with others who feel the same way.

  

### What you can expect from Lingoda:

* Approachable leaders and transparent communication - every voice counts at Lingoda!
