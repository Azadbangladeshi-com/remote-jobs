 _ **About the Team**_

The Engineering Team at Clari is deeply committed to building an enterprise-grade platform that serves as the backbone for our customer's most critical business process - Revenue. With an unrelenting commitment to innovation, our mission is to craft the ultimate revenue intelligence platform for our customers. Rooted in Agile principles, we foster a culture of adaptability and efficiency across all our teams. If you're energized by the prospect of contributing to a dynamic environment that emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, and leveraging the forefront of technology to address customer needs, we would love to meet you.

  

The Customer-Centric Engineering team is the front-line engineering team that is the bridge between the Customer Support and Product Engineering teams. Composed of self-motivated individuals who love debugging and solving problems. We triage escalated customer issues to either solve them or redirect them to the appropriate product teams. We do a little of everything, from enriching our technical support documentation to crawling through logs to find root causes to building tooling.

  

 _ **About the Role**_

As an Enterprise SAAS company, Clari has many large enterprise customers. Customer satisfaction is first and foremost on our minds. You will be responsible for resolving customer-escalated issues either by coding a solution or filling in the gaps where necessary. You will never get bored because once you completely master one product, we will ask you to go master another.

  

Engineers are empowered to solve technical problems while suggesting and implementing solutions that will prevent the same problem from repeating. We are the paramedics of the engineering world. We stabilize customer escalation, and if our tickets need some extra care, we send them off to get in-depth care from the product engineering teams. Writing good documentation is part of the team's philosophy. We measure ourselves by the number of times we point people in the right direction.

  

 _This is a work-from-home opportunity based in Alberta, Ontario or British Columbia provinces. Candidates must be a Canadian Permanent Resident or Citizen. We are unable to provide work authorization sponsorship at this time._
