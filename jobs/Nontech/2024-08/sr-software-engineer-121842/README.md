Ceros is backed by top-tier investors, including Sumeru Equity Partners, Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.

**About the Team**

As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.

We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much. As a member of a remote first team, you embrace transparency and collaboration.

**The Role**

Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best Software Engineers, Designers, and Quality Engineers, ready to build a best-in-class web content design studio, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.

Our software engineers are all full-stack, able to handle whatever work comes their way. This role is no different, however, we anticipate the responsibilities being initially more backend focused. Working with Software and DevOps Engineers, you’ll be focused on internal developer efficiency, tackling initiatives such as build time reductions, local development environment improvements, and API refactoring.

Our codebase is 95% TypeScript/JavaScript and the Ceros Studio product consists of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like React, Webpack, jQuery, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML Canvas element. We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs Node.js, PHP, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker and Jenkins within the AWS cloud.

**Key Responsibilities**

  * Writing well-architected, maintainable code (probably goes without saying)
  * Planning and leading high-complexity stories and epics
  * Writing unit, functional and e2e tests
  * Reviewing story plans and offering insights on impacts to other parts of the application
  * Having your day ruined by Quality Engineers who find every bug you write
  * Carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) to the highest of standards
  * Agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product
  * Participating as a primary on-call resource for service disruptions
  * Suggesting new technologies and techniques to improve engineer productivity
  * Collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices
  * And finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it

**Key Things to Know**

  * This is a full-time position
  * This is a remote-first role
  * This role will work within European time zone
