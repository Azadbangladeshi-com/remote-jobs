# **About Found**

The self-employed workforce is a rapidly growing, resilient, and colorful 60 million Americans. But self-employment comes with its own set of challenges: navigating taxes, accounting, bookkeeping, and business banking are just a few. Thatâ€™s where we come in.

Found is building tools that give self-employed people the security and peace of mind that has historically only been possible at big corporations. Weâ€™re a business bank account that automates taxes and expense tracking because we believe small business owners should spend more time doing what they love and less time on their business finances.

Weâ€™re looking for kind, resourceful, and passionate people to join us in building the safety net for self-employment.

 **About this role:**

Thanks for your interest in Found! Our engineering team is responsible for taking products from ideation to being used by tens of thousands of users every week. Weâ€™re responsible for everything from building the product, to technical operations (and everything in between such as improving reliability and performance, getting better with outages, reducing tech debtâ€¦)

The Growth Product team focuses on all efforts related to acquiring and onboarding new users for Found. This includes expanding the top of the funnel, optimizing funnel conversion, supporting revenue and growth partnerships, and building product led growth initiatives such as contractor payroll. We also build and maintain a marketplace of partnerships with third party platforms that offer value added benefits for our customers such as business formation and insurance, powered via real-time API integrations.

We are looking for a Full-Stack Engineer that enjoys quick iterations, a heavy experimentation culture, and owning features end to end to impact key company metrics. You will impact everything from the companyâ€™s central experimentation and feature flagging platform, to the first entrypoint for new and existing customers into the Found app. While we are looking for full-stack engineers, this role will be a 70-30 split of frontend to backend development.

 _Some recent team accomplishments include:_

  *  _Updating our onboarding architecture to provide highly customizable experiences based on the acquisition channel for that user._

  *  _Launching the ability to have draft payroll runs that can then be promoted into real payroll runs._

  *  _Adding the ability for users to manage their contractors through one centralized area (Contractor Management Center)._

  *  _Expanding our CMS functionality to give our marketing team more autonomy to create marketing pages without requiring any coding._

 ** _Day to day, you will:_**

  * Collaborate with other engineers to build and ship both user and internal facing features.

  * Work directly with designers and product managers to design and ideate on features. 

  * Determine how we will build, test, deploy, and scale features.

  * Build secure and maintainable code.

 ** _To thrive in this role, you have:_**

  * 5+ years of experience with backend and frontend frameworks.

  * Passion for learning and growing as an engineer and team member.

  * Knowledge of Ruby on Rails, React, Typescript, MySQL, and Redis.

 ** _You may also have:_**

  * Some experience with at least some of the technologies we use

  * Previous startup experience and/or demonstrated technical initiative on previous projects

  * Experience or interest in financial services, accounting, and/or self-employment

  * Experience running experiments and data analysis 

  * Experience as a manager, tech lead, architect, or founding engineer (not required - we are hiring at all levels!)
