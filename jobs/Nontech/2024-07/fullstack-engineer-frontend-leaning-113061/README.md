### None  
#### `ðŸŒŽ London`  

## **This role is remote, so it can be executed globally. However, to facilitate working with the engineering team we strongly prefer candidates on the East Coast (US) or in Europe (NY/London/Warsaw/Berlin).**

## About the role

We are looking for Full-Stack engineers to develop and maintain both front-end and back-end components of our product suite.

Your general responsibilities will include:

  * Building and maintaining the front-ends for our platform and products, which are built on top of our cutting-edge voice models and used by millions of users.

  * High degrees of ownership. You will be responsible for shipping end-to-end features across the front and back ends of our stack, as well as helping set the direction of the features and products you're working on.

  * Collaborating closely with others on the Engineering, Growth and Sales teams to understand, and design solutions for, our customer and internal teamâ€™s most important problems and workflows.

We believe in pairing engineers with work that matches their strengths and interests. This means that there is significant flexibility in staffing engineers across the company. However, your specific responsibilities might include:

  * Improving our existing products to ensure that theyâ€™re intuitive, powerful and make innovative use of our research teamâ€™s latest break-throughs. This could involve making sweeping UX changes, adding significant functionality, or building integrations with other common consumer/enterprise solutions.

  * Designing & developing clean, intuitive, and functional user interfaces for products that will be used by millions of users and the worldâ€™s largest enterprises.

  * Working with internal teams and customers directly to synthesize feedback, understand userâ€™s issues, and then design improvements and features to solve them.

##  **Who you are**

Each one of us is driven by the pursuit of excellence, supporting one another while taking ownership of our outcomes, and exploring uncharted territories. To thrive in this environment, you:

  * Are passionate about text-to-speech AI driven by a desire to make content universally accessible and breaking the frontiers of new tech.

  * Are a highly motivated and driven individual with a strong work ethic. Our team is committed to going the extra mile, even if it means working long nights and weekends to achieve our goals.

  * Strive for excellence in every aspect of work, consistently taking ownership of your outcomes and overdelivering on goals.

  * Have a humble attitude and are eager to learn whatever it might take to help your team and our customers succeed.

  * Are able to work 2pm to 6pm GMT.

##  **What you bring**

We do not require any formal experience, certifications, or degrees. Instead, we are seeking enthusiastic software engineers who can showcase solving impressively hard problems with artifacts such as past projects, designs, or GitHub contributions. We do require:

  * Experience with Web Development using Typescript/React

  * Familiarity with common software and system design patterns and infrastructure including APIs, cloud infrastructure tools, storage solutions, data structures etc.

  * Interest in UI/UX design

##  **What we offer**

  *  **Stock options** ; we want you to have ownership in the company and share the successes that lie ahead. Thatâ€™s why we offer early employees stock options as part of their compensation package.

  *  **Remote-first** ; we look at who you are rather than where you live. Our core hours are 2pm to 6pm GMT. As long as you are able to cover them, we support your preferred location.

  *  **Huge impact** ; thereâ€™s no endless debugging or refactoring of legacy code. Youâ€™ll make sweeping changes to our UI, ship features impacting millions of users, and contribute to the platform enabling it all.

  *  **Extraordinary team** ; we favor ambitious, smart people striving for outsized impact. Youâ€™ll work on the state of the art surrounded by people with extraordinary skills and positive attitudes.

  *  **Flexible working hours** ; besides our core hours, you build your day the way you prefer.

  *  **Bi-annual company off-sites** ; the last two were in Portugal and Switzerland.
