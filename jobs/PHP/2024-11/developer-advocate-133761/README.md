**What do we do?**

Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to their payment infrastructure. Instead of assembling and maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services, weâ€™re a Merchant of Record for our customers. That means we take away 100% of the pain of payment fragmentation. Itâ€™s faster, safer, cheaper, and, above all, way better.

Weâ€™re backed by investors including KKR, FTV Capital, Kindred, Notion, and 83North and serve over 3000 software sellers in 245 territories globally.

**The Role:**

Weâ€™re hiring a Developer Advocate with a focus on content. This role is an exciting opportunity to be at the heart of our developer-focused content and tooling at Paddle.

The Developer Experience team ensures implementing Paddle is a _delight_. We shape the Paddle API to be simple and intuitive, but powerful and flexible. We also build product features that make getting started with Paddle as simple as possible. All of this needs to be supported by world-class documentation, examples and tooling â€“ and thatâ€™s where you come in.

We are looking for a content-focused developer advocate to work collaboratively with the rest of the Developer Experience team as well as a global team of product managers, designers, and developers. Youâ€™ll produce clear documentation and other supporting content, from video scripts to integration how-tos, which will delight our customers and be critical to the growth of our platform

 **What you'll do:**

  * Produce content that reaches potential and existing customers directly, from changelog entries to long-form guides, tutorials and articles

  * Work internal and externally to understand opportunities that DX has and how to make the most impact

  * Create compelling copy in collaboration with product owners, product marketing and design

  * Document features, enhancements and bug fixes by gathering and organising technical information from engineers, the product team, and other stakeholders

  * Guide the presenting and writing of API documentation

  * Implement technical documentation standards

  * Proactively gather feedback from colleagues and customers to keep all documentation and content relevant and up-to-date

 **We'd love to hear from you if you:**

  * Want a hands-on content role with input into process and product direction

  * Have excellent written and oral skills in English, with great attention to detail, balanced with the need to be direct

  * Can demonstrate experience delivering API or developer-focused digital content such as product documentation, knowledge bases or similar

Weâ€™d be especially excited to hear from you if you:

  * Have the ability to quickly grasp complex technical concepts and make them easily understandable to software end-users

  * Have experience working both in early-stage technology companies and larger organisations

  * Have experience taking docs from good to great

 **Everyone is welcome at Paddle**

At Paddle, weâ€™re committed to removing invisible barriers, both for our customers and within our own teams. We recognise and celebrate that every Paddler is unique and we welcome every individual perspective. As an inclusive employer, we donâ€™t care if, or where, you studied, what you look like or where youâ€™re from. Weâ€™re more interested in your craft, curiosity, passion for learning and what youâ€™ll add to our culture. We encourage you to apply even if you donâ€™t match every part of the job ad, especially if youâ€™re part of an underrepresented group.  
  
**Please let us know if thereâ€™s anything we can do to better support you through the application process and in the workplace. We will do everything we can to support any accommodations needed.** Weâ€™re committed to building a diverse team where everyone feels safe to be their authentic self. Letâ€™s grow together.

**  
Why youâ€™ll love working at Paddle**

We are a diverse, growing group of Paddlers across the globe who pride ourselves on our transparent, collaborative and respectful culture.

We live and breathe our values, which are:

 **Exceptional Together**

 **Execute with impact**

 **Better than Yesterday**

We offer a full suite of benefits, including attractive salaries, stock options, retirement plans, private healthcare and well-being initiatives.

We offer all team members unlimited holidays and 4 months of paid family leave regardless of gender. We invest in learning and will help you with your personal development via constant exposure to new challenges, an annual learning fund, and regular internal and external training.
