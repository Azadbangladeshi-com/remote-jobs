# **About Found**

The self-employed workforce is a rapidly growing, resilient, and colorful 60 million Americans. But self-employment comes with its own set of challenges: navigating taxes, accounting, bookkeeping, and business banking are just a few. Thatâ€™s where we come in.

Found is building tools that give self-employed people the security and peace of mind that has historically only been possible at big corporations. Weâ€™re a business bank account that automates taxes and expense tracking because we believe small business owners should spend more time doing what they love and less time on their business finances.

Weâ€™re looking for kind, resourceful, and passionate people to join us in building the safety net for self-employment.

Weâ€™re a small but experienced team that has worked on diverse and complex problems at companies like Uber, Netflix, and Spotify. Weâ€™re excited to bring on another member to our team to enhance our Data Science and ML capabilities. Youâ€™ll start by partnering with our risk team to develop models to better identify risky activity, underwrite users for things like higher account limits or access to check deposits, and improve our understanding of user quality through identifying signals of â€˜realâ€™ vs. fraudulent businesses.
