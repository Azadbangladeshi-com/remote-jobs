#### `ðŸ’° $238,000 - $270,000` `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

## **About Engineering at Headway**

Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide. The engineering team at Headway is a small (~85) but mighty team using technology to build that future (and have a fun time while doing it!).

### Principles that guide us:

  * **Focus on the mission** : We view software as a means of effecting change in the world, not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapist to better solve the problems theyâ€™re facing. 
  * **Ship small, learn fast** : We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration
  * **Everything is a product** : Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.
  * **Optimize for trust** : We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.

### Tools we use:

  * **Languages** : Python 3, TypeScript
  * **Libraries** : FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React
  * **Datastores** : Postgres, Redis, DynamoDB
  * **Infrastructure** : AWS (Fargate, ECS, S3, and more), Spark, Flink, and Kafka
  * **Monitoring** : Datadog, PagerDuty
  * **Version control** : Github
