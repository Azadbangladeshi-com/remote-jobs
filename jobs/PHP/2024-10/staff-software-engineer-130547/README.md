As a remote-first company, weâ€™re focused on providing opportunities for high performing individuals to have deep impact in the fast growing fintech space. A clear mission, a commitment to continuous improvement and a willingness to experiment empower us individually and together deliver the best products for our clients and users.

Staff Engineers at Array are hands-on technical leaders with a focus on building and shipping high-quality products. They are deeply involved in the full development lifecycle, from design to deployment, and are responsible for driving key technical initiatives across the organization. Working closely with engineering teams, product managers, and cross-functional partners like UX, Compliance, and Sales, they ensure that products are developed efficiently and aligned with business objectives. Staff Engineers bring a strong technical expertise across multiple stacks and platforms, leading the development of new features and solutions while mentoring other developers.

Selected candidates will have the opportunity to participate in a 90-day evaluation period, typically structured as a 1099 or C2C contract, though full-time employment can be arranged if needed. During this period, you will be expected to work on complex tasks with some ambiguity, utilize AI tools to enhance efficiency, and collaborate with the CEO, product managers, and senior leadership. At the end of the 90 days, we will evaluate whether to transition to full-time employment, extend the contract, or conclude the engagement.

**You Will:**

  * Be open to feedback on your code and the way it is written. 
  * Leverage your full stack expertise; switch between Frontend client side development and Backend server side development.
  * Lead by example for junior developers, and ultimately, non-developers to successfully leverage AI tools and build.
  * Thrive on being a force multiplier for non-engineering but technical colleagues.
  * Index high on developer experience and developer velocity.

**You Have:**

  * Experience building a new product from scratch that shipped and had users onboarded.
  * An understanding that code is disposable and AI copilots will increase efficiency.
  * An excitement about AI in general and experience leveraging it to build something. 
  * Experience as a technologist across multiple stacks and platforms such as: Hotwire Turbo (or HTMX), Svelte, Python and Go.
  * Experience with database server development using PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server. 
  * A penchant for building developer tools.
  * Strong opinions on what good looks like, and what is not good, and how to teach others to form those opinions; contrarian views are encouraged.
  * A bias towards action and delivery in iterative phases vs chasing perfection.

**Pay Transparency:** $100 per hour
