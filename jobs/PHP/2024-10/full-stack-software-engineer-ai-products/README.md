# [Full Stack Software Engineer, AI products](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/full-stack-software-engineer-ai-products)  
### Mutiny  
#### `💰 $170,000-210,000` `🌎 Remote - US/Canada`  

## **Company Overview**

Most marketing teams can’t play a meaningful role in breaking through to target accounts because the 1:1 marketing strategies that work don’t scale, and what scales doesn’t work.

Mutiny helps B2B companies generate pipeline and revenue from their target accounts through AI-powered personalized experiences, 1:1 microsites, and account intelligence.

Our customers are some of the fastest growing companies in the B2B space including Snowflake, 6sense, Writer, Segment, and Qualtrics. We are backed by Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Insight Partners, and Y Combinator.

## **About the role:**

We’re looking for a high-impact software engineer who enjoys working at the intersection of applied AI and Data Science to drive important product initiatives.

### What you’ll do:

  * Build across the stack to help best-in-class B2B companies scale their growth.
  * Collaborate with design and product to build SOA AI-powered features.
  * Build scalable and resilient systems on top of the inherently non-deterministic nature of LLMs.
  * Design and build data and AI powered services to be consumed by other engineering teams.
  * Help set direction for Mutiny’s data and AI strategy.

* * *

## **What you bring** :

  * 5+ years of experience in software engineering
  * Proficiency in Python.
  * You have an understanding of Data Science and comfortable with manipulating/cleaning/normalizing data.
  * You have a “full-stack” mindset — you can be autonomous in implementing features e2e which helps you design useful AI services to be consumed by other teams.
  * You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time.
  * You love to collaborate with engineers across the spectrum of seniority and experiences.
  * Someone who is energized by ambiguity and can create structure in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.
  * Familiarity with LLM techniques (RAG, vector databases, langchain, agent frameworks) is a plus.
  * You are based in the US or Canada

* * *

## **What you’ll get out of it:**

  * You will create a name for yourself by getting to work with and support some of the fastest-growing companies in B2B SaaS.
  * You will get exposure to real business problems every company faces (growth) that you can take with you to start your own company (or to help scale another).
  * You will have fun, plain and simple. There is a reason our first company value is that work should feel like play.
  * You will experience a new way of working. Our team is fully distributed across North America and the EU. But we come together as a company for quarterly offsites (most recently in fun cities like Denver, Miami, and Santa Monica). This combination of experience-based work is a competitive advantage we continue to invest in.

## Hiring process for this role:

The hiring process for this role looks like this:

  * Hiring Manager Phone Screen (30 minutes): you’ll meet with the hiring manager to discuss your experience in engineering AI or data powered systems and how this role aligns with your career goals.
  * Technical Challenge (60 minutes): you’ll meet with one of our engineers to dive deeper into your technical skills.
  * Virtual Onsite (three back to back interviews): you’ll meet with more members of the Guidance and leadership team to dive deeper into your experience and see if you have potential to be a great fit for Mutiny.
