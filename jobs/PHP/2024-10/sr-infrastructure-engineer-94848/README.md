# **The Company**

Bigeye is on a mission to help enterprises trust their data. When used effectively, data can create magical experiences in services and products we all use every day. But those experiences suffer whenever data is delayed, missing, or low quality. Nearly every major enterprise still struggles to keep their data pipelines reliable and to maintain data quality, and can no longer afford to sift through a mess of manually created data quality rules.

Some of the world‚Äôs largest enterprises‚Äîlike Centene, Kenvue, and Williams-Sonoma‚Äîhave realized they need a more scalable approach, and now use Bigeye‚Äôs industry-leading data observability platform to keep their mission critical data applications running smoothly. Our unmatched support for enterprise-oriented data sources, and industry-leading data lineage capabilities, give us a unique foundation from which to serve enterprise data teams.

The scale of this challenge is incredibly exciting: we already check over 2 million data quality attributes every day for our customers, but estimate that only 2% of the addressable market has made the switch to using data observability.

Come join us in the journey to serve the other 98%.

You‚Äôll be joining the infra team at Bigeye, joining a powerhouse team of engineers, product managers, product designers, data scientists, and enterprise sales folks. You‚Äôll help us build and deliver products that customers love using.

#  **The Work**

Today, we‚Äôre focused on one of the most painful aspects of DataOps: observability and outages.

Most teams still discover data outages ‚Äì duplicated, missing, and unexpected data ‚Äì after they impact application features, dashboards, ML models, and ultimately, their stakeholders. We‚Äôre building a data observability platform to monitor their data content and alert them early so they can triage and reply instantly.

##  **What you‚Äôll be doing**

  * Build a deployment system that will orchestrate hybrid application deployments on our AWS cloud and customer clouds

  * Build out and maintain our CI/CD infrastructure to enable developers to collaborate and ship their code to production regularly, quickly, and dependably

  * Own the infrastructure needed to allow Bigeye to scale to meet its customer demand

  * Automate your own manual processes to allow developers to get their work on on their own without a direct dependency on the infra team

  * Design and build systems and processes to improve and track the reliability of our systems

  * Gather, assess, and create visualizations of metrics from our applications to monitor performance and identify problems

  * Participate in system design and capacity planning for our services

  * Meet directly with Bigeye‚Äôs customer base to understand their needs and enable them to use the product

##  **What You Bring**

  * 5+ years of experience as a software engineer or as an infrastructure engineer

  * 3+ years of experience as a software developer - you‚Äôve spent time on the ‚Äúother side of the fence‚Äù

  * Experience programming in at least one of Java, Go, or Python

  * Experience working with a Service Oriented Architecture in a cloud environment

  * Experience working in AWS

  * Experience with CI/CD processes

  * Proven passion for uncovering and unraveling the real customer problems

  * Excitement about being an early team member

  * Experience working with hybrid deploys

  * Experience working with modern observability tools

Bigeye aims to treat **real problems for real data teams** using boring technology. Success comes from building great products that address real obstacles for customers, not from satisfying our own technical curiosities.
