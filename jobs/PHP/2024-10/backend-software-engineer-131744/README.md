 **About you:**

  * You know how to build and scale data ingestion pipelines

  * You are a strong programmer with extensive Python experience

  * You bring experience and opinions about the different ways engineering teams can work and the tools they use

We believe that it takes a diverse team to build the best company we can. Jellyfish welcomes people from all backgrounds and especially encourages applications from members of groups underrepresented in the software industry.

A list of job experiences and qualification requirements is great, but humility, a performance-driven attitude, and a team-player approach are most important to us. We love to have fun and win in the process. We only hire people who have a passion for building great companies in an environment where a sense of humor is a must.

Occasional travel may be required.

Applicants must be authorized to work for Any employer in the US. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of an employment Visa at this time.

 **Letâ€™s talk about us!**

This is all about you, but you want to know a little about us. Jellyfish was started in 2017 as a team of three with one big idea: engineering is the core of modern business, so letâ€™s create and manage it that way! With the help of our customers, we have built the first Engineering Management Platform, providing visibility into engineering organizations, their work, and how they operate. We enable leaders to align engineering decisions with business initiatives and deliver the right software efficiently and on time.
