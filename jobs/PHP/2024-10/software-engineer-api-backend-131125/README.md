### Databento  
#### `ðŸ’° $0` `ðŸŒŽ Remote / San Francisco / New York / Salt Lake City`  

Databento is a startup that builds modern APIs to get financial data. As a Series A startup, we've raised nearly $30M to date, and have grown our revenues by over 958% Y/Y in the past yearâ€”all with a team of fewer than 30 employees.

We're looking for a software engineer to join our team. This is a remote role that primarily involves backend development and product engineering, with optional frontend responsibilities. We're open to hiring from a broad range of experience levels (on parity with L3 to L6 at a large tech firm). You'll have an outsized impact on the company's trajectory.

We offer health, dental, disability, and life insurance benefits, as well as 401(k) matching and visa sponsorships for full-time employees. We accommodate 100% remote work, with teammates living around the globe and paid in their local currency.

### **Responsibilities**

  * Design, develop, and maintain scalable APIs and backend services in Python and FastAPI.
  * Work with our product designers and frontend engineers to build new web application features.
  * Manage database schema changes and migrations to support our applications.
  * Collaborate with the systems team to implement best practices for the build, deployment, and CI/CD.
  * Implement monitoring and improve application performance and stability.
  * Ensure smooth feature rollouts and updates.

### Requirements

  * At least 1 year of full-time software engineering experience, preferably at a tech company, high-growth startup, or fintech firm with a large-scale web application.
  * Strong proficiency in Python.
  * Experience with modern web APIs (e.g., REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, HTTP/3) and web development frameworks (e.g., FastAPI, Django).
  * Experience with relational (e.g., MySQL, Postgres, Vitess) and NoSQL databases (e.g., Clickhouse).
  * Practical experience with containerization (e.g., Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes).
  * Practical experience with deployment pipelines (e.g., zero-downtime deployment, A/B/multivariate testing, feature flags).
  * Good communication skills and work ethic for a collaborative remote environment.

### Nice to have

  * Experience with frontend development (JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React SPAs, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind CSS).
  * An interest in financial data or algorithmic trading.
