##  **Some of our values**

We're not big on corporate-speak, but here's what matters to us:

  *  **We put customers first** : We work hard to understand our customers. We try to put ourselves in their position and do more than they expect.

  *  **We're direct and honest** : We believe in straightforward, truthful communication. We say what we think, clearly and respectfully.

  *  **We try new things** : We're not afraid to do things differently if it means finding better solutions.

  *  **We step up** : When we see a chance to make a difference, we take it. We trust ourselves to decide and take responsibility for what happens.

  *  **We're quick on our feet** : We adapt to changes and challenges. We see them as chances to learn and grow.

  *  **We stay curious** : We ask questions and explore new ideas. What we learn helps us keep growing.

  *  **We own it** : We're all owners here. We take charge, make the call, and own the outcome. 

## **The role & what you'll be doing:**

As a DevSecOps Engineer, you will be a key driver in integrating security practices across our development and deployment pipelines, ensuring that every product we deliver is secure, scalable, and resilient. This role requires both a strategic mindset and hands-on engineering skills to design and implement world-class DevSecOps processes. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to build and maintain highly automated CI/CD pipelines, secure infrastructure, and provide rapid response to security incidents.

  *  **Design & Implement CI/CD Pipelines**: Develop, optimize, and maintain CI/CD pipelines that integrate automated testing, security scans, and code deployment, ensuring rapid and reliable software releases.

  *  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** : Lead the implementation of infrastructure as code (IaC) using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or AWS CDK, ensuring consistent and scalable environments across all stages of development.

  *  **Security Automation** : Automate security checks within CI/CD pipelines, embedding vulnerability management, code analysis, and dependency checks directly into the software development process.

  *  **Cloud Infrastructure Management** : Manage secure and scalable cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) to support both production and development needs, optimizing for performance, availability, and cost.

  *  **Monitoring and Logging** : Implement advanced monitoring and logging systems to track application and infrastructure performance, security threats, and anomalous behavior, ensuring rapid detection and response to incidents.

  *  **Incident Response and Threat Management** : Develop, maintain, and execute incident response plans, including forensics and post-incident reviews, ensuring the ability to detect, respond to, and recover from breaches effectively.

  *  **Disaster Recovery and Resilience** : Architect disaster recovery strategies, ensuring that systems have robust backup and restoration processes in place to guarantee high availability and rapid recovery.

  *  **Compliance and Risk Management** : Ensure that all systems meet regulatory and compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR), working with relevant stakeholders to manage audits and ensure proper documentation.

##  **Join the team if you:**

  * Have 5+ years experience with DevOps tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, and infrastructure automation with Terraform, CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.

  * Have 5+ years experience in managing and securing infrastructure on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure), with a focus on automation, scalability, and high availability.

  * Have expertise in vulnerability management, threat modeling, and security monitoring, with hands-on experience integrating security into CI/CD pipelines.

  * Are proficient in automation scripting with languages like Python, Bash, or PowerShell.

  * Have experience implementing monitoring solutions and leading incident response teams during security events.

  * Have experience with compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, GDPR, ISO 27001, and handling related audits.

##  **Why Joins Us**

We're a startup. We can't offer you fancy offices or extra perks. But here's what we can offer:

  * Real impact. Your work will directly shape our product and company.

  * A seat at the table. In a small team, every voice matters. Yours will be heard.

  * Freedom to work your way. Home, coffee shop, moon base - if you're productive, we're happy.

  * Top pay. Competitive salary and an opportunity for equity or stock grants. 

  * Time off when you need it. Take at least 15 days. More if you need it. 

  * Budget to keep learning. Because if you're not growing, we're not growing.

  * The chance to build something from the ground up. This is the time when what you do has the biggest impact.

  * Problems worth solving. We're reshaping how work gets done.

At Siena, weâ€™re not just looking for people who can do a job. Weâ€™re looking for people who want to break boundaries, create the future, and reshape industries. If thatâ€™s you, we look forward to your application.
