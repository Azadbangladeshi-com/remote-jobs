**About Us:**

Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses.

We‚Äôre based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Floodgate, Y Combinator, DNX Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Justin Kan, Elad Gil, and more.

We value diversity ‚Äî in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguide‚Äôs team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As an early stage start-up employee, you‚Äôll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitioners‚Äô lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.  
‚Äç  
 **The following should describe you:**  

 **You want to join an early stage company:** We're young, but we've found strong demand for our products and are growing quickly. We've landed numerous top audit and advisory firms as customers, displaced entrenched legacy technology, and have high demand for product access.

 **You believe that great design and UX are requirements:** We bring a user-centered approach to problem solving, focusing deeply on our customers. We're competing with legacy software that was built in the 1990's. These products have extremely low user satisfaction, but are worth billions of dollars just because they're entrenched with so many firms.

 **You're obsessed with data:** We have a rich dataset that is ripe for automation and AI. With our data advantage, we can provide our users with intelligent automation, predictions of common workflow patterns, and analytics that will fundamentally change the structure of audits.

 **You greatly value culture:** Our goals are lofty, we work very hard, and we want to transform an industry. _More importantly_ , we also work responsibly. We place a premium on building a sustainable, inclusive, high EQ, high feedback, and safe company that celebrates individuals of all backgrounds.
