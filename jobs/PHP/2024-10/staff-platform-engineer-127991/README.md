**About the team:**

Engineers on this team construct our rules-based calculating engine for processing sales commissions. This might sound simple if you have never been exposed to sales comp plans, it is not! We are low on meetings, high on accountability. Most of the team are in EST time zone but we have a few located in PST and Central as well. We are far from maintenance / progressive evolution in many areas, there is a lot of room to make a big impact in the overall design.

**What you'll be doing:**

Reporting to the Manager of Data Platform, the **Staff Backend Engineer** will play a critical role in the evolution of our **Spark** based data platform. You'll lead development efforts for our complex, data-rich platform features while being an example to the team of code quality and thoughtful software design. You will be working on the most challenging code at Forma.

**What skills / traits are we looking for:**

  * Prior experience designing and building complex backend solutions. We use Python, but the language is less important than the skillset.
  * Solid background in schema design and data modelling, SQL and ideally some NoSQL solutions
  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
  * History of reducing ownership cost and improve reliability and observability in a product.
  * Deep appreciation for building end-to-end customer facing products with a strong sense of customer empathy .
  * Interest in being involved in Forma.aiâ€™s product direction along with establishing best development practices and processes from design to deployment , while maintaining our software solution.
  * Thrive in a detail-oriented collaborative environment with Product, Engineers, and Analytics teams.
  * Big plus if you have a background working with Spark, or other ETL tools / frameworks
