### DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

* Podsie is a web application that implements research-backed strategies to enhance student learning retention. Our platform focuses on spaced retrieval practice, a method that involves students practicing newly acquired knowledge by answering questions spaced out over time. This approach has shown promise in improving learning outcomes, and Podsie makes it easy for teachers and students to incorporate this practice into their educational routines.

  

* As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be instrumental in advancing our mission to improve student learning outcomes through evidence-based technological solutions. Your responsibilities will encompass a wide range of projects aimed at enhancing Podsie's capabilities and impact:
*  ** _Build Core Features_** _:_ Design and implement new features that demonstrably improve student learning outcomes and support Podsie's mission to drive educational success.
*  ** _Improve User Experience_** _:_ Develop enhancements that make Podsie more engaging, efficient, and effective for both teachers and students.
*  ** _Develop LLM-based Features_** _:_ Create and refine LLM-based features such as tutoring chatbots, personalized content recommendations, and interactive learning tools to enrich the student learning experience.
*  ** _Integrate Advanced Analytics_** _:_ Implement data visualization and analysis tools that provide teachers with actionable insights into student performance, enabling them to tailor instruction effectively.
*  ** _Research and Development_** _:_ Engage in R&D initiatives to explore new technologies and strategies that can enhance Podsie's impact on student learning and retention, with a particular focus on LLM-based innovations.
*  ** _Expansion_** _:_ Contribute to the development of new features, functionalities, and subject offerings (e.g., Podsie Math Suite) to broaden our impact and improve outcomes for a wider range of students.
*  ** _Data-Driven Personalization_** _:_ Develop algorithms and data models that tailor content and pacing to each student's unique needs and progress.
*  ** _Platform Scalability_** _:_ Optimize Podsie's architecture and infrastructure to ensure reliable performance for hundreds of thousands of daily users as we experience rapid growth.

  

* Moreover, you will play a crucial role in supporting our National Science Foundation (NSF) grant project. This research initiative aims to deepen our understanding of how spaced retrieval practice improves STEM learning and to develop STEM-specific spacing algorithms for authentic educational contexts.
