#### `ðŸ’° $190,000 - $210,000` `ðŸŒŽ United States, Remote`  

**Human Interest is on a mission to ensure that people in all lines of work have access to retirement benefits.**

Nearly half of all working Americans are not saving enough for their future. Too often itâ€™s because they are employed by a company that doesnâ€™t offer a retirement plan. Human Interest is changing that by making it affordable and accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to offer employees a path to financial independence through retirement savings.

Weâ€™re a high-growth tech company changing the retirement industry. Weâ€™ve raised $500M and are backed by leading investors. Most recently, by funding from BlackRock as well as many other top investors: TPG (The Rise Fund) with SoftBank led our Series D, Glynn Capital, NewView Capital, USVP, Wing, Uncork, and others.

**About the Team**

The Recordkeeping team is responsible for bookkeeping of all the retirement plans served by Human Interest. The recordkeeping platform standardizes all transacting and trading on behalf of retirement plans and participants. All money movements utilize the recordkeeping platform, including contributions, roll-overs, distributions, loans, and more.

The transactional, trade, and position data housed by the recordkeeping platform power robust reporting for all financial and trading activity, including descriptive data that tells the full story of the activity. This team is critical to the success of the business, being a foundational platform to record all the financial activities.
