The security landscape is always shifting and introducing new adversaries. The Red Canary CIRT operates 24/7 to track down threats in endpoint data and deliver fast and actionable detections to our customers.

  

This is not a role where you are encouraged to passively accept the current state. At Red Canary, you are empowered to actively look for opportunities to automate repetitive and tedious tasks.

It is expected at the Senior Detection Engineer level, that you already have the skills necessary to immediately contribute to the operational and project needs of the CIRT. This is accomplished by performing analysis of malware, improving our detector footprint, implementing code that will improve our CIRT platform, and more.
