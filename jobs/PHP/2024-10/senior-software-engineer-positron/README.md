  * Mentoring and collaborating with other engineers 

### **What youâ€™ll learn:**

  * A deeper understanding of the variety of environments and patterns used by data science practitioners
  * How features in modern IDEs are developed using standard protocols
  * How to build development tools for both desktop and server environments leveraging TypeScript and Python
  * Skills to transition into technical leadership

## **About you:**

  * Have at least 5 years of professional experience as a software engineer and/or data scientist
  * Are collaborative, an effective communicator, action oriented, and invested in learning
  * Have specific Python experience relevant for the Positron project, which could be demonstrated via one or more of:
    * Experience building tools for Jupyter notebooks, such as a custom extension
    * Maintaining an open source Python package
    * Building internal tooling used by an organizationâ€™s Python data analysts
  * Have specific domain expertise relevant to the Positron project, which could be demonstrated via one or more of:
    * Practical data science experience including exploratory data analysis, reporting, and/or machine learning 
    * Extending a Python LSP such as Jedi
    * Creating and publishing a VS Code extension

### **Within one month, you willâ€¦**

  * Get to know everyone on the team and become familiar with our current development strategies
  * Follow our onboarding guide and suggest improvements
  * Work on your first feature and see your code changes reflected in our current product 

### **Within three months, you willâ€¦**

  * Participate in feature planning
  * Leave each part of the product that you work on in better shape than how you found it
  * Feel comfortable with the repository layout and begin understanding the broader architecture of the IDE
  * Understand how language servers, runtime kernels, and extensions power features in the IDE
  * Grow your understanding of the challenges our early adopters face by responding to GitHub issues and other channels for user feedback

### **Within twelve months, you willâ€¦**

  * Plan features and drive their development
  * Share your expertise and insights with team members, contributing to the collective knowledge and skill set of the engineering team
  * Be able to point to parts of the products that you have significantly contributed to
