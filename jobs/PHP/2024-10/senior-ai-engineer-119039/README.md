## Profile Overview

The role of the AI Engineer at saas.group is to empower our brands to introduce AI and ML-powered features into products used by hundreds of thousands of users. This means that the role entails an end-to-end approach to building AI and software in general. From researching new models (LLMs, clustering, sentiment analysis), implementing services and APIs that brands can tap into, and communicating requirements to the DevOps teams so that these new tools can be reliably accessed, this role will allow you to own the results and maintain them in production. This means that although this is not a traditional AI Researcher role, where we develop, train, or fine-tune models, there is an intense excitement in seeing the work of the Central AI Team impact the products that users love, through AI/ML integration.

**Your immediate impact in the first 3-6 months will be:**

  * Work with the team on building next generation feedback processing tools (clustering, topic mining, insight extraction) through agentic architectures, based on LangChain, Haystack, and other NLP tools and frameworks.
  * Build and support internal Central AI tools, based on open-source technologies, so that the company can access chat-based LLM-powered applications (LibreChat, Danswer, and others).
  * Support the AI community within saas.group with insights, news, tools, and advice in terms of using LLM-powered tools, integrating AI into the day-to-day work, or perspectives on the impact of AI.

## Your responsibilities

  * Build great software that people love to interact with and ensure an end-to-end delivery experience: from researching technology, to maintaining it in production.
  * Bring the latest and greatest when it comes to building software that integrate LLMs. You will be responsible for building features using LangChain, Haystack, Scikit, and other NLP and ML frameworks/libraries.
  * Contribute to the projects built and maintained by the team centrally such as Danswer, LibreChat, document generation tools, and more.
  * Participate in product discovery sessions with saas.group brand leadership teams to identify new opportunities for integrating AI.
  * Create POC projects (using Python, FastAPI, Docker) that validate certain features before the team engages in building them throughout.

## What You bring to the table

  * At least 4 years of hands-on experience with Python, along with FastAPI, Flask, or Django knowledge
  * Extensive knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose
  * Hands-on experience with PostgreSQL with pgVector or Mongo with Vector Search
  * Strong knowledge of Celery (on Redis or RabbitMQ)
  * LangChain or Haystack knowledge
  * Hands-on experience with DigitalOcean or AWS (VPS, application platforms, storage services)
  * LLM infrastructure knowledge

## What‚Äôs in it for You

  * **Ultimate flexibility:** We‚Äôre 100% remote. You can work from wherever you like, whenever you like.
  * **Freedom and autonomy:** We‚Äôre a high-trust team, and you‚Äôll be given lots of independence to solve problems in your own way ‚Äî with plenty of help from the team when you need it.
  * **Minimum bureaucracy:** We don‚Äôt like to get bogged down with meetings and red tape. We like to be efficient and keep momentum steady & sustainable.
  * **Small & friendly team:** We help each other out, have fun, and joke around.
  * **Our network:** We are a community of entrepreneurial SaaS professionals that regularly exchange ideas, knowledge, learning and expertise with each other internally. 
  * **Unlimited paid time off:** We want you to recharge your batteries when needed.

We don‚Äôt just simply offer you to ‚Äútake a job with us‚Äù but rather to ‚Äújoin us on this journey‚Äù _to build the world's largest platform of independent SaaS companies._

Sounds like something you‚Äôre up for? Feel free to apply even if you don‚Äôt check all these boxes. We believe in the power of diversity and fresh perspectives to spice up our team. Your application might just be the missing ingredient!
