# [Fullstack Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/fullstack-engineer-119887)  
### Lumos  
#### `ðŸ’° $110,000 - $170,000` `ðŸŒŽ Remote`  

Weâ€™re seeing very strong adoption with core products, and in order to double down our investment and support accelerating growth, weâ€™re hiring a Fullstack Engineer to join the team. You'd be among the first 100 employees and set the foundation for extreme growth. ðŸ“ˆ

You'll build and own core product features, in addition to helping to ensure the health of our engineering systems. You will work across the stack, focusing on areas you are most excited about and that bring value to customers. Beyond your technical work, you will gain leadership opportunities early on as we grow our engineering team. You'll be involved in scaling the product, the team, and the entire company. ðŸš€

### âœ¨ Your Responsibilities

  * Solve challenging technical problems across the stack to develop critical customer-facing features; includes the frontend (React, Typescript), communication layer (GraphQL, Apollo), and backend (Python, Flask, sqlalchemy).
  * Drive end-to-end development of projects and see the feature through to launch and own iterations and followups.
  * Design and build robust, scalable systems that enable us to scale our platform to 10x the number of users.
  * Uplevel your team by providing feedback and potentially mentoring junior engineers or interns.
  * Become an expert in the Lumos product, working with other stakeholders to refine user requirements and team goals.
  * Grow the engineering team! Interview candidates and refine our recruiting processes as we rapidly grow.

### **ðŸ’°Pay Range**

$110,000 - $170,000. _Note that this range is a good faith estimate of likely pay for this role; upon hire, the pay may differ due to skill and/or level of experience._

### ðŸ™Œ What We Value

We care much more about your motivation and excitement to grow into the role than we care just about your CV. Instead of focusing on what people need to have, we focus on what people need to do. Additionally, we try to find out whether you would be a good fit for Lumos based on our values that define how we achieve outcomes and what characteristics we value.

We strongly encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to apply. ðŸ¤²
