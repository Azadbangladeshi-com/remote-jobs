Aristaâ€™s Software Engineering team runs at a scale rarely found - TBs of source control, 60GB work trees with 1000s of developer branches in flight at any given time, over 400K daily build/test jobs and over 150 homegrown and cloud native services running on a 100 node on-prem bare metal kubernetes cluster. Operating these systems takes vigilance, responsiveness to alerts, and a steady stream of updates and bug fixes to keep things running smoothly and efficiently as well as to increase our ability to monitor, understand and visualize them. The role will cover all aspects of our Kubernetes infrastructure, and may include monitoring, responding to, and enhancing alerts, working to unify and standardize our alerts, fine tuning code for scalability and performance, debugging problems, simplifying and securing developer experience with k8s etc. You will own your projects from definition to deployment, developer and vendor interactions, and you will be responsible for the quality of
everything you deliver.

Working in the Engineering Productivity (EngProd) group, you will collaborate and work with other engineers to design, build, scale, and operate the systems that the rest of Aristaâ€™s development teams use. The EngProd team uses industry-standard systems like Ansible, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Grafana, Spinnaker, MySQL, ElasticSearch, Google Cloud, and Varnish and also internal systems that weâ€™ve built from the ground-up to automate CI/CD, testing, analysis, and visualization.

  * Set up guidelines and paved paths for service dev teams improving developer experience around the k8s platform.
  * Work with Aristaâ€™s software engineers to identify bottlenecks and limitations in our workflows, tooling, and infrastructure around k8s and provide fixes for those problems.
  * Engage with 3rd party vendor support as part of triage.
