#### `💰 65k-95k USD` `🌎 `  

## CSGOEmpire is looking for hungry, back-end developers that can think out of the box - developers that never back down from a challenge.

Weâre looking for the shadowy anonymous types that:

  * Are enthusiastic about coding, problem-solving, and continuous improvement;
  * Try to almost obsessively optimize and hack everything they come across;
  * Are fully at home in the gaming and online gambling space.

Weâre not the place for vanilla corporate types that only care about clocking in and out. We want people that are truly special and truly driven to grow.Â

Right now, weâre looking for fully remote back-end developers to help fulfil our ambitious plans of building multiple, massive projects at once.Â This is a new opening to help manage our growing workload.

Candidates with a minimum of 3 years xp with the following are welcome:

 **Tech**

  * PHP 8+ (Laravel Framework 10+), MySQL, Redis Cache
  * Microservices
  * PHPUnit
  * Node.jsÂ _(big plus)_

 **Tools and services**

  * Docker
  * Jira
  * Git (Gitlab)

 **Here are some of the areas youâll be contributing to:**

  * Collaborating closely with the senior developers and front-end developers to integrate seamless features
  * Crushing bugs in a timely manner
  * Assisting in optimizing performance and scalability to handle a growing number of users and transactions
  * Implementing REST APIs using industry leading standards
  * Making sure that each feature you implement has Unit tests implemented to provide a bug-free release
  * Over time, crafting your own path to becoming a senior engineer

We want to go big, and we need the right people on board â and you can be one of them.
