### **Description**

Order Desk is a multi-channel order management app that helps ecommerce merchants automate, organize, and control their order fulfillment process. Our customers include new and established merchants in ecommerce, fulfillment companies managing stores for their clients, and internationally-recognized people and brands‚Äîto name a few.  

###  **About us**

  * **We view customer support as essential to making a good product.** The problems and questions our customers bring to us are what create the foundation of every project we work on, so we are all involved in support in some way. This allows everyone in our company to be in tune with our customers and knowledgeable about our product and the way it‚Äôs being used.
  * **We are committed to diversity and inclusion.** We are serious about everyone on our team feeling safe, comfortable, heard, and valued at work.
  * **We are self-funded.** We are committed to growing responsibly and working creatively within the constraints of our own progress. Our goal is to make a useful, accessible product based on the needs of our customers, not the demands of investors.
  * **We believe that remote work is the future.** Being a remote company offers us the ability to connect with a team of people from all around the world. We also understand that each person has their own unique approach to their workflow and we trust our employees to manage their own time within their set working hours while keeping in mind that this role includes time-sensitive work.
  * **We believe in quality, not quantity.** We don‚Äôt use metrics or KPIs to measure the success of our teams. While productivity and response times are important, providing stellar support and empathy to our customers is the priority.
  * **We are generous.** We teach and learn from each other on a daily basis. Decisions are often made collectively based on the wisdom and experience we each bring to the conversation. 

### **About the role**

  * This is a full-time Senior PHP developer position. Our application is written in PHP and connects to over 300 third-party services to import and export orders, shipments, and product information to and from these other services.
  * You will primarily be responsible for writing code by following best practices and standards, with guidance from our experienced Principal Engineer and Product Architect.
  * The entire Order Desk team is generous with our knowledge and our time, and we teach and learn from each other daily. Decisions are often made collectively based on the experience we each bring to the conversation. We are willing to look beyond our ideas and comforts to grow our potential and do the right thing for our customers and each other.
  * We are currently in the process of rewriting our existing platform to modernize its architecture with scalability and maintainability in mind. You‚Äôll be responsible of collaborating in building of the back-end and the front-end code of the new version, and to ensure it is up to code base and industry standards. Our platform integrates with over 300 3rd parties and this brings up fun challenges we tackle every day. We utilize JavaScript and SCSS for our user interfaces and interactivity. On the back-end we work with PHP ^8 without a specific framework.
  * Here's what a typical day at Order Desk looks like: You log in to work and ping a wave hello as you sip your favorite morning beverage. There've been discussions around the next feature we'll be building with scalability, maintainability, and customer experience in mind. You pick up a task that is assigned to you and start writing your feature or bugfix and make sure it is well tested. As you do so, you follow the code and quality standards set for the project you're working on. Once you are happy with your code, you push your feature branch up for review. You notice that you are tagged in two pull requests and review those to ensure they do what is defined in the specification and are up to standards. Some days you're building UI components with SCSS or interactivity using JavaScript. Other days you're refactoring the PHP backend of existing services.

 _Order Desk is committed to breaking structural barriers within our hiring process and driving fair hiring practices in our workplace. Women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) continue to be underrepresented within our industry. Research has shown women and people of color disproportionately do not apply for jobs where they do not meet 100% of the ‚Äúrequirements.‚Äù Regardless of whether or not you identify as one of these groups, if you meet most of the requirements and this role aligns with your career goals, then we encourage you to bet on yourself and apply!_

### To Apply

We are not expecting a cover letter and would rather you spend time answering the questions we have listed. We know it‚Äôs a little unconventional to go through a job application process like ours, but we are very intentional with the questions to give us a chance to get to know you. Don‚Äôt worry, we won‚Äôt ask you to complete a test or share your screen during a call because pressure produces diamonds and not our people.

_The application questions are designed to get to know you and your work. We ask that you avoid using AI-generated answers as this hinders giving us insight into who you are._

There are a few steps to our application process:

  1. Application Questions
  2. Video Response
  3. Interview(s)

If you are moved to the next round, we will contact you to let you know the next steps.

Our hiring team is pretty small so this process usually takes about 3-4 weeks, so we appreciate your patience while we review each application. By the conclusion of this process, we will follow up with _everyone_ who applied.
