Description

## About the team

The Aryeo Team at Zillow is the leading software platform for real estate photographers and media companies. Our vertical SaaS product helps photographers do everything from online scheduling and payment processing to file delivery and management.

## About the role

As a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer on the Aryeo Team, you'll be working directly with our engineering, design & product teams and be responsible for shipping full projects and features that immediately benefit our customers.  

You should have an in-depth understanding of Laravel and be comfortable working across the front-end and back-end.  

Our system is built with Laravel, Postgres, AWS, Tailwind CSS, and utilizes the latest in front-end frameworks such as InertiaJS and Vue 3.

 **You will:**

  * Work primarily on large, complex feature rollouts, managing from start to finish (discussing requirements, technical scoping, building, testing, launching)
  * Build and ship smaller enhancements to the product outside of project work
  * Collaborate with our existing team members
  * Help our customer success team interpret and debug technical issues from customers
  * Investigate bugs, determine root problems, and deploy fixes
  * Have fun using the latest and greatest tools in the Laravel & Vue ecosystems
  * Help thousands of small businesses (our customers!) run smoothly

This role has been categorized as a Remote position. ‚ÄúRemote‚Äù employees do not have a permanent corporate office workplace and, instead, work from a physical location of their choice which must be identified to the Company. Employees may live in any of the 50 US States, with limited exceptions. In certain cases, an employee in a remote-designated job may need to live in a specific region or time zone to support customers or clients as part of their role.

In California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Nevada, New York and Washington the standard base pay range for this role is $156,300.00 - $249,700.00 Annually. This base pay range is specific to California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Nevada, New York and Washington and may not be applicable to other locations.

In addition to a competitive base salary this position is also eligible for equity awards based on factors such as experience, performance and location. Actual amounts will vary depending on experience, performance and location.

## Who you are

We're looking for someone who excels at working across our entire stack and is exceptionally experienced with Laravel. Our team has a "builder first" mentality that gets carried throughout every part of the business. We certainly don't understand everything, and we're looking for people with the curiosity to dive deep and problem-solve through customer requests, technical problems, and more.

 **Our ideal candidate would meet the following requirements:**

  * 8+ years of web development experience
  * 5+ years of experience using Laravel/PHP
  * Comfortable in a small team/fast-moving environment
  * Understanding of the "full-stack" and how pieces fit together
  * Strong experience with VueJS or React
  * Relational database experience (migrations, indexes), Postgres or Geospatial experience
