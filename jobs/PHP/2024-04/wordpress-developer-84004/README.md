 _Attention to detail is one of our_ core values _! This is your chance to stand out :)  
_

To love this role, here‚Äôs the type of person you are:

  * You‚Äôre a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through from conception to completion. Our developers often "own" features/tasks and are responsible for scoping, development, and testing.
  * You're an excellent communicator, fluent in both verbal and written English, who makes sure nothing slips through the cracks. We believe communication is critical and there is no such thing as over communicating.
  * You have the curiosity and desire to learn and grow your skills.
  * You're passionate about leaving your mark on the web for all to see and are excited to work on tasks that impact _millions_ of users.
  * You take pride in the quality and craftsmanship of your work rather than just doing it to get it done.
  * You're a team player who is comfortable working along side and helping other developers, and you don't take critical feedback personally.
  * You're happy jumping between front-end and back-end development tasks, or tackling tasks which require both.
  * You're happy working on tasks of all sizes - from small bug fixes and enhancements to large features/rewrites.

Common responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

  * Triaging bugs and small enhancements that come into GitHub.
  * Scoping, writing, and testing new product features and addons.
  * Refactoring legacy code with a particular attention to backwards compatibility.
  * Providing feedback and peer review for other developers (Github PRs).
  * Communicating with the team and supporting your peers using chat, audio, and video.

**Requirements**

  * Professional experience with WordPress plugin development, architecture, and standards.
  * Advanced proficiency with PHP and MySQL, including modern PHP practices (OOP, autoloading, namespacing, traits, interfaces, etc).
  * Strong familiarity with JavaScript (vanilla JS, jQuery, ES6, etc).
  * Ability to use and extend build tools like gulp and webpack.
  * Familiarity with package managers such as Composer and NPM.
  * Experience working with third-party APIs (Eg Stripe, Drip, Zapier, etc).
  * Competent with version control through git and GitHub.
  * The ability to iterate and ship ideas quickly.
  * Exceptional troubleshooting skills.
  * Ability to keep complex ideas and features _simple_. (Simplicity is a core value!)
  * Previous freelance or remote work experience.
  * Personal Computer with Internet Access
  * Availability to participate in audio/video meetings between the hours 9 am - 5 pm EST.

**Bonus points if you also have:**

  * Advanced proficiency in JavaScript frameworks like VueJS or React.
  * Experience with e-commerce platforms or related APIs (Easy Digital Downloads, WooCommerce, Stripe, PayPal, etc).
  * Experience with DevOps or infrastructure management.

**Benefits**

Working for a fast-growing bootstrapped company is a rare opportunity, one we consider a lifestyle choice rather than a job choice. Our positions are challenging, but also come with amazing advantages and fulfillment to those who earn them. Here‚Äôs what we offer.

  * Competitive Salary.
  * Term Life Insurance and Accidental Death & Dismemberment for all full-time team members during their employment.

  * Unlimited PTO after 90 days of employment. We encourage employees to take the time they need for a vacation, stay healthy, and spend time with friends and family.
  * Holidays (based on your location)
  * Paid maternity and paternity leave.
  * We happily provide or reimburse software you‚Äôll need as well as books or courses that promote continued learning.
  * We cover all costs of company travel (including our annual all-company retreat and mini-team meetups).
  * Additional Perks include AM Welcome Box for new team members, Yearly Anniversary Gifts, and Technology Stipend each work anniversary.
  * We give you the opportunity to solve challenging and meaningful problems that make a difference.
  * Ability to work with some of the best people in the business through frequent, if not daily, interactions.
  * And in case you were wondering: no politics, no b.s., and no jerks.

** This is a remote position - our team is spread around the globe! Our home base is in Florida, USA, so company operating hours are 9am - 5pm ET (UTC -5). While full coverage is not a requirement, you must be available during a portion of the day.

Awesome Motive is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, veteran status, or any other basis protected by federal, state, or local law.
