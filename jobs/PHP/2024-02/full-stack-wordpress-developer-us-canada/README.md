### Who we are

At Coefficient, we‚Äôre bringing spreadsheets into the 21st century. Yes, it‚Äôs an ambitious goal, to reinvent one of the backbones of the world economy. But the time for spreadsheet modernization is now.

We‚Äôre a San Francisco-based startup with an international and remote-friendly workforce. Our team is filled with passionate, creative people who are dedicated to disrupting a space that needs disrupting.

Our Co-Founders, Navneet and Tommy, bet big on the opportunities nobody else can see. Their last startup, Shopular, was backed by Y Combinator and Sequoia, and acquired by Rakuten Ebates.

Coefficient is building a remote-first company with a focus on hiring the best talent regardless of location.

### What we do

Today, over a billion users worldwide leverage spreadsheets in day-to-day tasks. However, spreadsheet technology has not changed much in the past 30 years.

### That‚Äôs where Coefficient comes in.

Our solution connects, automates, and shares live data in Google Sheets, so your reports, dashboards, and insights always stay up-to-date. Connect Google Sheets to any source system in a single click.

Coefficient completes the missing link in the modern data stack. With Coefficient, business users can access and analyze the data they need, when they need it, in the spreadsheet platform they prefer.

Now any team member can harness a new category of spreadsheets to unlock more opportunities with their data.
