### TileDB  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ US,Remote,Cambridge, MA`  

We are looking for a Python-focused software engineer to build and enhance our existing APIs and integrations with the Scientific Python ecosystem. TileDBâ€™s Python API builds on the TileDB C++ library, and integrates closely with NumPy to provide zero-copy data access. You will enhance and release the TileDB-Py API; help to maintain the TileDB Cloud Python API; build new integrations with data science, scientific, and machine learning libraries; and engage with the community and customers to create value through the use of TileDB.

### Location

Our headquarters are in Cambridge, MA, USA and we have a subsidiary in Athens, Greece. However, you will have the flexibility to work remotely (GMT -7 to GMT +3) as long as your legal residence is in the USA or Greece.

### Expectations

In your first 30 days, you will familiarize yourself with TileDB, the TileDB-Py API, and the TileDB Cloud platform. After 30 days, you will be fully integrated in our team. Youâ€™ll be an active contributor and maintainer of the TileDB-Py project, and ready to start designing and implementing new features, as well as engaging with the Python and Data Science community.

  * Experience with machine learning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch)
  * Experience with Amazon Web Services or other cloud platforms (Azure, Google Cloud)
  * Experience with dataframe-focused systems (e.g. Arrow, Pandas, data.frame, Polars)
  * Experience with technical data formats such as (e.g. Parquet, HDF5, VCF, DICOM, GeoTIFF)
  * Experience with other technical computing systems (e.g. R, MATLAB, Julia)
