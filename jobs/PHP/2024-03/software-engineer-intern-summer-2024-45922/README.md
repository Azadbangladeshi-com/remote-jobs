### Whatâ€™s the role?

We are looking for a Software Engineering Intern to help build new and amazing experiences for people buying and selling on Etsy.

As a Software Engineering Intern you will join Etsy to take on practical problems in a strong engineering environment, while being mentored by some of the most dedicated engineers in the industry. We're looking for full-stack engineers - you'll be dealing with the MySQL, Memcache, PHP, and front-end stuff (HTML/CSS/JS). The teams working on each feature are pretty small (a few engineers, a designer, and a product manager), so there's a lot of meaningful collaboration.

Because we're making user-facing features, we believe strongly in gathering and analyzing numerical data to help guide our decisions. To that end, you'll be able to use our in-house analytics tools to gather information and gain insights. You'll also be able to use Etsy's Continuous Deployment architecture to push code to production whenever you please (and you'll probably push on your first day here).

Do you find joy in collaborating with peers on solutions and taking risks by experimenting with technology to improve a product? If so, this could be the perfect match.

This is a full-time position reporting to the Engineering Manager and and the base salary range will be $60 - $65 per hour.

For this role, we are considering candidates based in the United States. Candidates living within commutable distance of Etsyâ€™s Brooklyn Office Hub or in the San Francisco Bay Area may be the first to be considered. For candidates within commutable distance, Etsy requires in-office attendance once or twice per week depending on your proximity to the office.
