For the past 9 years, weâ€™ve helped cutting-edge companies in the United States and Canada -both large and small, build great development teams and develop great products. Online shops, digital agencies, SaaS providers, and software consulting firms are a few of our clients. Our team of over 100 engineers is distributed in more than 10 countries across the Americas. We are a fully remote company working with a wide array of technologies and have expertise in every stage of the software development process.

We also participate in group activities like movie nights, trivia, and meme competitions. We stand for honesty, fairness, respect, efficiency, hard work, and cooperation.

  

 **What are we looking for?**

In this opportunity, we are looking for a Software Engineer to work with one of our foreign clients, who are providing work with a diversity of clients in different industries including, Health, Legal, and Automotive.

If you are independent, a great communicator, a problem solver, and have strong attention to detail, this is a great fit for you! Our jobs are fully remote â€“ as long as you have the skills and can get the work done well, you can work anywhere in the listed countries you want.

If you have the skills and can get the job done, join us and work from anywhere you want!

  

 **What's unique about this job?**

As a Software Engineer, youâ€™ll be developing and maintaining an application deployment system that allows microservice-architecture applications to be deployed easily on Kubernetes. An integral part of onboarding business units into this deployment system is converting all of their existing applications, databases, and supporting services from bare-metal/VM deployments to containers.

### Here are some of the exciting day-to-day challenges you will face in this role:

  * Youâ€™ll be a member of a small team of developers working in an Agile setting.
  * The team's primary responsibility is applying 12-factor principles to existing applications and deploying them to Kubernetes. 
  * The language, code quality, availability of tests, and level of active development vary between business units and applications. In this role, you will see many applications and go down some very interesting rabbit holes to find the best way to containerize and migrate the applications.
  * The team's working hours are centered around GMT+1, but the team supports business units in the Americas - primarily between GMT-4 and GMT-8. As a result, sometimes you will need to shift your schedule to accommodate meetings with members of the business units you work with.
  * Because of the number of "moving parts" involved, communication and good planning are paramount.
  * Youâ€™ll look for and take opportunities to help the team become stronger and more experienced.

### You will shine if you have these:

  * Demonstrated proficiency in at least two web programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go), ideally with exposure to application frameworks such as Laravel, Spring Boot, Rails, Django, etc.
  * Good understanding of Linux environments, including scripting and automation tools.
  * Experience with Docker for containerization of applications.
  * Demonstrated experience with CI/CD pipelines, including setup, maintenance, and optimization.Solid knowledge of Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized applications.
  * Able to work independently and have good attention to detail.
  * You love to talk about the nuances and trade-offs of implementation approaches, but you're also result-oriented and know how to avoid "analysis paralysis"

### Here are some of the perks we offer you:

  * Salary in USD
  * Long-term
  * Flexible schedule (within US Time zones)
  * 100% Remote

 **Hey, you are still here!**

  

So, let us ask a few questions. Do you like working in a friendly environment? Are you fluent in English? Do you have a strong work ethic, are detail-oriented and have an ownership mentality? And most importantly do you love music and puppies? If so, then what are you waiting for? Come join our team and become part of this awesome company! We will be expecting you.
