Bitcoin.comâs mission is to create more âeconomic freedomâ in the world. By economic freedom we mean the ability for individuals to freely acquire and use personal resources however they choose. We assert that economic freedom is a fundamental human right and a vital component of human dignity â and we believe that it is foundational for peaceful and prosperous societies.

Our vision is to provide the next billion people with access to products that exemplify the ideals of Bitcoin. These ideals - which include peer-to-peer transactions, decentralization, censorship resistance, and permissionless-ness - bolster economic freedom. Our approach is to develop and promote widely accessible products that create economic freedom. Our multichain cryptocurrency wallet app - with over 40 million self-custody crypto wallets created - provides people with an easy-to-use and highly secure method for buying, selling, storing, sending, receiving, and trading cryptocurrencies.

Since 2015, Bitcoin.com has been a global leader in introducing newcomers to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. In December 2022 we took the next step with the launch of our own rewards and utility token VERSE and our own decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Verse DEX. By incentivizing and gamifying engagement in the Bitcoin.com ecosystem, Verse supercharges Bitcoin.comâs mission to onboard the world to crypto and accelerate the transition towards a more inclusive financial system.
