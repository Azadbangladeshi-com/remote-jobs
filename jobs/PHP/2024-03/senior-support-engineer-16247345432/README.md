Pay Range: $1000 - $2000/month

 **About the company:**

The client is a publishing platform that powers the world’s leading media brands. We work with publishers to conceive, design, build and run deeply engaging mobile apps, lightning-fast websites, and beautifully rich digital editions and archives.

**About the job:**

As a Senior Support Engineer, you'll play a crucial role in helping our customers and solving their problems. You’ll be immersed in our products, plus the worlds of publishing and mobile apps. Depending on what’s happening on a given day, you could be debugging and fixing code, or configuring our customers’ apps. You’ll know how a SaaS company works, and experience in publishing would be a bonus. This is an ideal role for a developer or software engineer who enjoys dealing with customers directly, as well as writing code, and is already working in or wants to move into a customer-facing role.

 **Responsibilities:**

● You’ll help monitor our support desk, triaging customer support tickets, diagnosing and resolving issues, and, where necessary, making code change.

● You’ll coordinate complex technical requirements with the development team, helping to launch new apps and upgrading existing apps

● You’ll collaborate with your co-workers in Customer Support and across teams, particularly working closely with our Project Managers, Customer Success Managers, and development teams to understand our product and customers’ pain points

● You’ll get to know the ins and outs of the process of building apps and submitting them to stores, as well as working on websites, content management systems, and various tech tools

● You’ll get stuck into troubleshooting and figuring out knotty problems, and use our tools to build and submit apps yourself

● You’ll develop documentation and train customers on our product, and also where needed provide training on third-party tools (e.g. basic analytics, push notifications)

● At least 5 years of development/coding experience

● Strong B2B and B2C experience

● Understanding of our various code bases (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP)

● Exceptional troubleshooting and problem-solving skills - you’re customer and solution-focussed, being able to understand issues, formulate questions and find the answer

● Proactive and self-motivated with the ability to work both independently, as well collaboratively in teams

● Profcient in WordPress

● Great attention to detail and a helpful, can-do approach to work

● Curious, enthusiastic and well organized

● Excellent communicator (verbal and written) and skilled at talking to customers and developers alike

● A genuine love of technology, with the desire to learn continuously and pick up new skills

● Happy working in a very busy, buzzy environment and adept at juggling multiple priorities at a time
