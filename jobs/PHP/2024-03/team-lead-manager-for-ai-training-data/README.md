Leadership Principles

  * **High Bar and High Praise.** Recognize good work as often as you can. Positive feedback dramatically increases the likelihood of repetition, and recognizing hard work will encourage your teams to perform with a high level of execution. 
  * **Excellence is a Behavior.** Create a culture of excellence in all that you do. Move fast with a high bar for execution and demonstrate your standards in your interactions with your team. They will rise to emulate your behavior, and demonstrating your values openly will inspire your team to perform at a high level. 
  * **Complaints Go Up.** As a manager, itâ€™s important to be aware that you are the representative of the Scale organization to your reports. Maintain alignment with the organization when interacting with your team. Receive complaints and comments from your team, and work to resolve them with your Coordinator or Project Lead. However, expressing frustration to your team degrades their trust in the broader organization. To put it succinctly: â€œComplaints go up."
