In a world where jobs and careers are rapidly changing, we believe that transformational growth and continuous improvement is mandatory for people and companies to thrive. We believe that coaching is the best way to unlock this growth, and we believe everyone deserves access to coaching. We are on a mission to bring our unique model of coaching to every member of the global workforce.

We strive to create a fun, conscientious, collaborative, and supportive work environment and are looking for several team members to join us. We are a remote-first company based in the US, Canada, and Latin America, with $8M raised from leading VCs and angel investors.

## **About The Role**

**We‚Äôre looking for a product-minded senior software engineer** with experience working with data to help us build a differentiated and impactful AI & software coaching product alongside software and AI based tools to augment human coaches.

  
In this role, you‚Äôll join our small-but-mighty engineering team, and work closely with design and coaching to create a unique, compelling, and valuable product experience that brings the power of coaching to life within a software platform.

**Key Responsibilities:**

  * **Building features and experiences from 0-to-1.** This is a product focused role, and you will be shipping regularly. You ideally have experience building early stage products, and are comfortable making technical trade offs and taking risks.
  * **Design our AI-enabled capabilities.** We are building out a set of application capabilities on top of foundational models, and you will be critical todetermining how we structure those for adaptability, reuse, and scalability.
  * **Work with coaching to help translate coaching insights into AI Agents.** Mento has a tremendous advantage in bringing AI coaching to life - an extremely strong team of active coaches. Part of this role will be figuring out how to translate coaching workflows into high quality product experiences.
  * **Build pipelines and integrations to import and export data into the product.** Our product connects into a wide ecosystem of productivity and learning and development tools. You will help us design and build these integrations scalably and reusable.
  * **Educate the team on best practices around data and AI.** We have a small, fluid team filled with experts but not silos. As an expert bringing AI and data expertise, you will be expected to share your knowledge with the rest of the team via peer mentorship, code reviews, lunch and learns, and more.

## **Who We‚Äôre Looking For**

We‚Äôre looking for an experienced software engineer to help us put theory into action integrating cutting edge artificial intelligence into our coaching platform. Our tech stack is primarily Ruby on the backend, with React with TypeScript on the frontend, with an emphasis on iterative product development.

  * You are a software engineer who has experience shipping data-related products into production with real users - we‚Äôre currently not looking for new grads.
  * You‚Äôre comfortable working in dynamic programming languages and have experience with server-side web applications.You ideally have deep Ruby on Rails experience, but if your happy place is python, php, or node, we‚Äôre still happy to hear from you.
  * You have an understanding of core data engineering and software architecture concepts for modern data-based applications. Ideal candidates will have opinions on things like designing search indexes and the right way to set up data pipelines.
  * You operate well with some ambiguity. We‚Äôre an early stage startup, and we‚Äôre still iterating fast and figuring out a lot about our customer. For some people, that‚Äôs thrilling, and for others terrifying. Know what you‚Äôre opting in to.
  * You‚Äôre not afraid of touching the front-end. You may spend most of your time in the backend, but you can sling some javascript around when needed.

## **Why Work with Us?**

  * We are a company dedicated to empowering professionals to live meaningful careers. That starts with our culture at Mento. 
  * You‚Äôre very excited about being part of a team crafting novel ways for people, teams, and companies to unlock their performance, growth, and how we all work together.
  * We work hard to foster a workplace built around trust, respect, collaboration, and having fun. We believe that feeling comfortable and safe at work is critical to creativity and productivity. Work-life balance should be your right, not your reward. As long as you are getting your work done and being accountable to your teammates, we don't care when, where, or how you work. 
  * We are a highly collaborative work-environment where every team member plays a critical role in building our products, shaping our culture, and growing our business. This is a unique opportunity to join an early-stage, mission-driven team.
  * We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product for our users. If you‚Äôre passionate about helping more people feel and perform their best at work, we want to hear from you.
