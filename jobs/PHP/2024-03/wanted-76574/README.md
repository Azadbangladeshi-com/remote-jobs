**Headquarters:** Los Angeles, CA  
**URL:** https://courseconcierge.com

Hi there,

  

My nameâ€™s Carrie and I run Operations at Course Concierge (courseconcierge.com) â€“ a publishing house that creates online courses with well-known YouTubers and other experts.

  

Our courses have hundreds of thousands of paying students, and our clients' videos are seen by tens of millions of people every month.

  

For the right person, this is a Dream Job â€” and dream company.

  

 **If you are someone whoâ€¦**

  

\- Wants to excel in your career and takes pride in active and stimulating work

  

\- Is looking for a shot to prove yourself

  

\- Gets excited at the prospect of learning a tremendous amount, with fast-paced and varied demands

  

\- Has the ability to work within tight deadlines and juggle multiple tasks with poise

  

â€¦this could be the opportunity youâ€™ve been looking for.

  

Weâ€™re a great company to join. Hereâ€™s whyâ€¦

  

\- We have a small, lean, and unbelievably engaged team, with world-class people.

  

\- Our clients are fantastic. We only take on a handful and are incredibly selective in who we work with (a number are household names you have heard of).

  

\- You can work from anywhere in the world. Our current team spans three continents.

  

\- You will have support from our brilliant lead developer, the dependability of a team, and consistent income.

  

 **This position is the right fit forâ€¦**

  

â€¦Someone who really wants it.

  

A developer is the backbone of an online company, and relied on more than anyone. Without the right developers, the rest of the team canâ€™t function.  
  
Weâ€™re looking for a second developer to join our team.

  

The perfect fit for us is someone who is already excellent, but who wants to learn and is hungry to become the best of the best.

  

You will be working alongside our Senior Developer on maintaining existing online courses and building new courses, all built with WordPress.

  

And, you'll also work closely with members of our in-house course production team, who will have eyes on maintaining a great experience from the customer's perspective.

  

 **You need toâ€¦**

  

\- Like a big workload and be comfortable working quickly. We like to get a lot done in a day and you will be pushed

  

\- Welcome revisions and embrace our perfectionist tendencies (as well as our clientsâ€™)

  

\- Help us refine our technical processes

  

\- Be a clear and capable communicator. As a company, we take writing seriously. Great English and attention to detail are essential.

  

\- Be someone we love working with! Fit comes first, above everything else for us.

  

Nearly all of our communication is written (we use Basecamp and are big fans of it), but weâ€™d like you to be comfortable getting on the occasional Zoom call, too.

  

 **You will be needed for the followingâ€¦**

  

Throughout each project, we have the following development needs.

  

1\. Lay the foundation

  * Setup of a clientâ€™s domain and hosting, and integration of a payment gateway, membership plugin and email platform. We do everything on WordPress.

  

2\. Create a stunning email capture page

  * From our design teamâ€™s PSDs, everything you create needs to be wonderfully responsive, and no stone (from the thank you page to a nicely formatted confirmation email) left unturned.

  

3\. Build a long-form sales page

  * Our designers make sales pages that are many thousands of words digestible and enticing to read. We need you to do their work justice.

  

4\. Creation of membership area

  * Using a WordPress membership plugin, create a layout that houses a course with clear and simple navigation.
  * We always look to enhance the user experience for clientsâ€™ customers and deliver the best learning environment possible.

  

5\. E-commerce development

  * Making sure payments are taken via our e-commerce plugin, membership entitlements are correct, and segments are created in a newsletter platform for buyers.

  

6\. Maintenance and support

  * Performing scheduled and not scheduled maintenance and security updates on our WordPress sites
  * Contributing to our QA procedure for all things related to our websites
  * Helping the rest of team who work on our site solve their day-to-day operational issues

  

7\. Ongoing development

  * Maintaining and expanding with new features our custom theme and plugins
  * Developing and maintaining integrations with various third party APIs

  

**The position is right for you ifâ€¦  
**  

\- You completely understand how WordPress works at the code level. You have built your own custom themes/plugins and you know how to extend WordPress core. Having experience with any of the following is a plus: Astra Theme, Easy Digital Downloads, LifterLMS, Beaver Builder.  
  

\- You understand how REST APIs work and you are comfortable consuming RESTful web services, either via the client (AJAX) or the server (PHP).  
  

\- You like finding smart and elegant solutions to coding problems, in line with WordPress coding and security best practices. Your code is clean, understandable and well commented.  
  

\- You have solid knowledge of PHP, MySQL, HTML, Javascript/JQuery, CSS. Experience on any kind of front-end framework (i.e. Bootstrap) or Javascript framework is a plus.  
  

\- You are competent with version control systems (Git), and having experience with modern web development workflows and tools is a plus.  
  

\- You communicate clearly in written and spoken English, not only with other developers, but also with non-technical colleagues.

  

*

  

The position will start at 15-20 hours per week, and pay will be set at a competitive hourly rate to start.

  

For the right person, this role could grow over time to 30-40 hours per week as the company grows.

  
  

**To applyâ€¦**

  

Please email me ONE example of a responsive page you have coded, along with a brief pitch on why you think youâ€™d be a great fit. Also, please share where you are located.

  

Send your email to: developer@courseconcierge.com

  

Do not send more than one link or your entry will be disqualified.

  

Also, please do not send a resume, CV or attachment of any kind. We donâ€™t care where you went to college (or that you even went at all) â€” all that matters is whether you can do it.

  

We wonâ€™t be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will send a list of interview questions in writing, then, for the few we like best, set up a brief Zoom call to discuss the opportunity.

  

The deadline for submissions is March 31, though those who apply sooner have an advantage.

  

Thank you for reading. Best of luck, and I look forward to hearing from you!

  

Carrie
