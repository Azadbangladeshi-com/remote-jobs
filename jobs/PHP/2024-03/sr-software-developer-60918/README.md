Description

# **Wanna build the future?**

## {We do, too!}

#### Sr. Full Stack Developer

You have a lot in common with Batman. Your utility belt has so many amazing compartments that you canâ€™t even list them. Youâ€™re ready for the challenge of multiple projects simultaneously. Your entire career has prepared you for, well,â€¦ this.

Full-Stack Software Engineer

ATOM is changing the consulting industry by blending true business acumen and technology consulting together to unlock wonders for our clients. At ATOM, a client isnâ€™t just an organization, a client is a person. Whether weâ€™re writing code to build a product that breaks through new revenue goals or weâ€™re crafting a leadership+technology strategy that will redefine a companyâ€™s next-generation, we live in a world where the solutions are both wide and deep.

 **What Are We Looking For:**

As an agency, ATOM exists to serve its client's needs and in order to best do this, we look for the most talented and experienced developers we can find. And most importantly, weâ€™re developers too â€” you wonâ€™t find any detached management who have never coded here at ATOM.

 **What Will You Be Doing:**

Youâ€™ll be a key part of a small team consisting of a few Developers, a Project Manager, a UX Lead and often the Client. Youâ€™ll be communicating with the team via Slack, email, Jira, and Zoom. The coding will usually be full stack, could be open-source or .Net, probably will involve AWS or Azure, and could be greenfield, app modernization, or adding features to legacy projects. Weâ€™ll want you to be comfortable and excited to learn new technologies, frameworks, and languages.

**Essential Functions**

  * Develop software solutions by evaluating requirements; conferring with clients and peers; studying systems flow, data models, and system integration points; considering mobile, accessibility, and usage at scale; following the software development lifecycle. 

  * Evaluate problem definition, requirements, and propose solutions.

  * Assist in and/or directly develop flowcharts, documentation, requirement documents, and prototypes

  * Write well-designed, testable, performant, and secure code

  * Integrate software components into a fully functional system

 **Travel**

Travel is primarily local during the business day, although some projects may require more out-of-the-area and occasional overnight travel.

 **Location**

Normally you would work out of ATOMâ€™s Portsmouth, NH, office primarily, but due to the pandemic, you will have the option to work remotely or from our Concord, NH, office.

**Required Education and Experience**

  * 4+ years of work experience as a Software Engineer or Software Developer, developing software in some backend language, ideally node/javascript, .Net, PHP, or Python. Frameworks like MVC for .Net, Laravel for PHP, Typescript, or Django are an excellent bonus.

  * Experience with relational databases (we use MySql and MS SQL normally, Postgres occasionally), SQL, and ORMs

  * 3+ years developing in front-end javascript frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, Vue, or jQuery.

  * Aggressive problem diagnosis and creative problem-solving skills. Ability to work and thrive in a fast-paced environment, learn rapidly and master diverse web technologies and techniques. 

  * Experience with design and architectures built for scale, speed, and security

  * Experience with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure is a bonus!

  * BS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or relevant field is nice but not required

 **What We Offer**

  * All the standard benefits: Health, Dental, Long-Term Disability, Short-Term Disability, Life Insurance and a 401k plan with a 4% company match

  * Flexible schedules and flexible work-from-home. We understand that sometimes life events happen and you need the flexibility to be at home or away from the office.

  * Unlimited Paid Time-Off (PTO) You do still need to come to work! We support taking time off to enjoy your interests outside of working at ATOM

  * Dog-friendly office

  * The occasional mid-day wine tasting or after-hours gathering!

  * An open ear for your thoughts on ways we can work better as a team. Weâ€™re a small organization and we value diversity of thought.

  * 16+ Holidays a year!
