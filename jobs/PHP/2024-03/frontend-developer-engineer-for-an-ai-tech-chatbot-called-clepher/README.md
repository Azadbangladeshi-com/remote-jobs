**Headquarters:** The Netherlands  
**URL:** https://clepher.com

We are seeking a Frontend Developer / Engineer with 2+ years of experience. Our ideal candidate should be able to write readable, scalable, and reusable code. Definitely a plus if you're proficient in legacy PHP, jQuery, and JS code, as we're rebuilding our app from the ground up using newer technologies like React. We're also working on new AI-powered features that customers can implement in their chatbots.  
  
You should know commonly used concepts, practices, and procedures within programming and coding for a tech-based company with employees worldwide. Creating clean, readable code that your teammates can understand is a must. Always consider security, we all hate insecure code, right?  
  
Clepher is a scale-up dealing with a lot of data, so you must be able to create code that scales up smoothly (a code that runs well for 100 users may not run as smoothly with 10K users). The target is to ensure and deliver excellent code that translates into functional features our customers love.  
  
We try to keep team calls to a minimum. We have a 20-minute team call on Wednesday, and when needed, the department head will start calls with the team. We believe most communication can be done via messaging, so we use Slack and ClickUp to communicate and track our progress.  
  
You'll find Clepher is backed by a fun, hard, hard-working team that loves to help change the lives of our customers. We're looking for a great Frontend Developer / Engineer to join the fun. Are you the one? Apply!
