### Netflix  
#### `ðŸ’° 700000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

Weâ€™re looking for a creative, highly-skilled Senior Technical Artist to help us build a brand-new, AAA, multi-platform game.

As our Senior Technical Artist, you will help bridge the gap between art and engineering. You will collaborate with studio leaders and directors in art and engineering to define workflows that support and optimize the creation of art assets. Throughout the development process, you will also contribute to shader authoring as well as performance evaluation and optimization.

We're building the foundation for a small, but ambitious, team of creators whose primary goal is to create a game experience that our players want to repeatedly come back to; and as our Senior Technical Artist, you will be able to create, ship, and run a game without any competing design constraints due to monetization.

Quality is something that we are immensely proud to be aiming for, and we are looking at putting the right team together to help take us forward. Weâ€™re looking for that group of leaders who are aligned with our core values, and care deeply about the experiences they create as well as the people they make them with. Those who bias towards action and are energized by the learning that comes with bold experimentation at an agile pace. As a part of Netflix, we strive to hire the best and value integrity, excellence, respect, inclusion, and collaboration.

Now is an amazing time to join Netflix as we seek to entertain the world. We have over 200 million paid members in over 190 countries, and we wonâ€™t stop there!
