Your immediate supervisor would be based out of our Boston Office in the US, however youâ€™ll be able to operate day to day in your local timezone, but on occasion be able to adjust your schedule to cover meetings or calls with staff and clients in Australia, New Zealand, or the US west coast.

As such you must be setup to operate effectively from your own work-space and be comfortable with pure remote / home-based working.
