**URL:** https://www.silverorange.com/

**  
The company  
**  

silverorange is a design and development agency based in Canada. When pursuing work, we focus on interesting and meaningful projects. Over our 24 years as a company, we've worked with well-known technology organizations like Duolingo and Mozilla, not-for-profit organizations working in areas including affordable internet access for low-income families, and with world-renowned doctors training other doctors through online education.

  

Weâ€™re proud of the fantastic products weâ€™ve built in partnership with our clients and weâ€™re actively invested in the processes behind these products. We are committed to fostering a team-focused approach in our work of building great user-focused systems, while also placing a serious emphasis on quality of life, openness, empathy, and a supportive work environment.

  

**The position  
**  

Weâ€™re looking for an intermediate or senior web developer with a focus on PHP to join our team. Youâ€™ll start your silverorange career helping to develop and support sites for a series of clients including some in the medical education field. The anticipated path for this position is to spend several years focused on PHP development, with the opportunity to work with other Web technologies over time as well.

  

This position is available immediately and we will work with you to get you started as soon as possible.

 **  
Responsibilities**

  * Implementing updates and improvements on a series of websites built with PHP, PostgreSQL databases, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-ends.
  * Working with PHP packages managed with Composer.
  * Updating and building out new front-end pages using a combination of PHP, data from a content management system, command-line scripts, and CSS including responsive designs based on provided mockups.
  * Reviewing code and content changes from other developers on the project.
  * Working from mockups (Figma, Photoshop, etc.), wireframes, and design systems.
  * Communicating with team members and clients to understand and balance requirements.
  * Identifying and helping to address accessibility issues in Web systems.
  * Writing tests for your work.
  * Planning, estimating, prioritizing, and balancing tasks and client requests.
  * Context switching between several client projects on an ongoing basis.

  

**Requirements**

  * Be eligible & available to work from Canada. Eligibility to travel to the United States for occasional client meetings is an asset.
  * Be able to quickly learn and understand new systems.
  * Have a solid understanding of object-oriented programming in PHP and be comfortable navigating a medium-sized code base spread over multiple packages.
  * Have experience working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, in our case), including managing updates and access to the database via PHP, and direct manipulation of data and data schemas.
  * Have an understanding of core front-end Web technologies, including HTML, responsive CSS, and JavaScript.
  * Have some experience using version control systems like Git to manage changes.
  * Be able to communicate clearly with clients and co-workers across multiple time zones. Several of our key clients are in California and we have team members in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and PEI.

  

While not required, if you have any of the following skills let us know:

  * Writing and maintaining CSS including responsive layout, browser support, and preprocessors like LESS or SASS.
  * Mastering assets (SVG and/or PNG) from Photoshop, Illustrator, or Figma for use on the Web.
  * Comfort working on remote servers via command-line tools including SSH and psql.

  

**Growth & ownership  
**  

Our team is co-operative and will help you learn and expand your skills via mentoring, team-wide support, and learning opportunities. All members of the team are encouraged and given space to grow as individual contributors, and have ongoing opportunities in project and team leadership.

  

Weâ€™re excited to hear your fresh ideas and approach. We have decades of collective experience, and we all continue to become better at what we do by both teaching and learning from each other. Add your voice to our mix!

  

Opportunity for employee ownership is a fundamental part of silverorange (non-founders currently own more than a third of the company) and weâ€™re currently working on new ways to transfer even more ownership to employees.

  

**Inclusion & diversity  
**  

People with different backgrounds and experiences make us stronger, and weâ€™re always looking for ways to improve. Our team is getting more diverse across many dimensions of diversity, but weâ€™re still missing perspectives that could make our work better. We highly encourage people from traditionally underrepresented groups in our industry to applyâ€”weâ€™d love to hear from you.

  

**Remote working is just as good as local  
**  

Our team has been remote-friendly for over 20 years, and remote-first for the last 9. We continue to improve our approach to having a dispersed team. This is a full-time remote position regardless of location, though you are welcome to work from our lovely offices in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island if you wish.

  

The majority of our team is full-time remote and 95% of our clients are remote. Youâ€™ll need to be comfortable working with a remote team regardless of your location.

  

Typically all employees spend at least one week each year working from our Charlottetown office, so plan on visiting PEI semi-regularly.

  

Though you may be working remotely, youâ€™ll be an active member of a great and small but growing team, both here at silverorange and with our clients. Regular voice or video communication will help keep you in touch with the smart people with whom youâ€™ll be working.

  

 **Benefits & compensation**

  * Flexible work days, approached collaboratively with you to allow for the realities of appointments, family minding, and your everyday life.
  * 3 weeks of paid vacation, on top of 10 paid days of civic holidays, and 3 weeks of paid company-wide shut down.
  * Generous health and dental coverage, with 100% of premium covered by silverorange.
  * New computer hardware every 3 years, and other tools as needed.
  * Yearly company-wide bonuses based on overall company success, plus ownership opportunities and dividends for long-term employees.
  * Salaries based on skills and experience ranging from CAD $63,000 - $88,500, with both annual company wide salary band adjustments as well as opportunities and expectation of ongoing career and compensation growth.
  * Additional remote worker salary add-on of CAD $3,000 per year and a wellness salary add-on of $500 per year.
