Job Description

 **About the Team**  
Slack is looking for an experienced Staff engineer to join its Core Product organization to help design, develop, and maintain the Search product experience for all Slack entities. The Search product is an integral and compelling feature of Slack as it enables our customers to find and discover messages, channels, people, files, and other entities within their workspaces. It is also of central importance to our efforts around generative AI, helping to build products that are informed by the full wealth of knowledge in our customersâ€™ companies. We are seeking a candidate who can continue to evolve our system to be accurate, reliable, performant, and scalable, while helping push us to the cutting edge of search technology, incorporating the latest and greatest developments in the realm of information retrieval.
