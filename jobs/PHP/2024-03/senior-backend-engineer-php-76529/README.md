**About us**

We are in business to save independent retail in Europe!

Across our towns and city centres, unique neighbourhood shops have been overshadowed by large chains and e-commerce giants. To combat this, weâ€™ve created a BtoB wholesale marketplace designed to help independent retailers to compete against larger competitors and thus maintain a connected community of stores, brands and shoppers in the places we live.

Established in 2019 in France, weâ€™ve since expanded to other European countries, including Spain, Germany, UK and the Netherlands. Driven by our commitment to customer satisfaction, we constantly innovate to develop cutting-edge tools and services that set new standards in the market.

Get in touch if you are looking to join a purpose-driven, international team that revolutionizes an old-fashioned industry!
