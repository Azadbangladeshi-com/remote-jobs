At Famly, weâ€™re looking for a Senior Fullstack Engineer or T-shaped Frontend with a dream of going fullstack, to build scalable solutions and help our amazing product reach next level, to help the thousands of daycares that use Famly. You will be joining a fantastic team as the fifth engineer in our Parent/Teacher Partnership crew.  
  

You Are either a very strong intermediate or a solid senior, with an absolute minimum of 2 years of professional experience, you have a good grasp on React development and functional programming (either professional experience or a personal passion), experience with GraphQL and REST APIs, Git handling, agile development etc.

  
  

We are looking for people in the following locations:

  * Copenhagen, Denmark   
  

  * Berlin, Germany (Remote)  
  

  * UK (Remote)  
  

  * Lisbon, Portugal (Remote)  
  

If you will be applying for a remote position, we only accept time zones that are +- 2h from CET.  
  

  

And Famly are...? Well it all began when our co-founder Henrikâ€™s daughter was ready to start at daycare. He couldnâ€™t believe the amount of work being done on paper - and how distant he felt from his first child during the day. The paper â€˜parentâ€™ books they exchanged once a month just werenâ€™t cutting it. Together with his friend, our co-founder and CEO Anders, they set about solving that.  
  

These days, the 140 of us building Famly talk about trying to do two things for our 4,000 nurseries:  
  

  * Giving children the best possible start to life.  
  

  * Championing the vital work that goes into making that happen.  
  

We do it with software that brings hundreds of thousands of parents closer to their childâ€™s day while theyâ€™re away from them. We also make financial, pedagogical, and planning tools for more than 34,000 childcare professionals, saving them hours and reducing their admin stress.  
  

Ultimately, that gives them more time and headspace for the little ones that really matter. Come help us make that happen.  
  

**  
What you'll be doing:**

  * Working in our Parent/Teacher Partnership (PTP) crew with other frontenders, backenders, fullstacks, designers and our product managers.  
  

  * You will play a key role in planning whatâ€™s next, designing, developing and rolling out new features and changes.  
  

  * Youâ€™ll team up with both the Frontend and Backend Chapter to shape the future of our tech stack, tooling and reducing complexity across our code.  
  

  

**Youâ€™ll thrive in this role if you can:**

  * Build modern single-page apps with Typescript in React  
  

  * Build solid APIs in GraphQL and REST (we primarily use Scala with our GraphQL API but also maintain a PHP REST API)  
  

  * Use functional programming (we use cats, cats-effect, fs2, refined, and slick)  
  

  * Bring crystal clarity to complex and ambiguous ideas and projects.  
  

  * Communicate feedback, expectations and information in clear and kind ways, both written and spoken (weâ€™re over 40 different nationalities, and our company language is English).  
  

  * Learn super fast, be open-minded and ready to adapt our technology, teams and ways-of-working as Famly scales in brave new directions.  
  

  * Make your teammates shine by supporting each other to learn and grow.  
  

Weâ€™re looking for people with **senior experience level** , and we appreciate that everyone brings something unique, so even if you donâ€™t tick every box, please still apply.  
  

  
  

**  
Youâ€™ll love working here because:**

  * You get a clear career framework and coaching to make sure youâ€™re growing, a 10,000 DKK personal development budget and a â€˜Weâ€™ll buy you any book you wantâ€™ policy.  
  

  * Weâ€™re all about hiring a diverse array of clever people - who are kind and good humans too. It means Famly is full of top thinkers and generous teammates waiting to help you shine.  
  

  * A value of â€˜make your colleagues shine' is all about breaking down silos, celebrating one another, and staying connected across departments, offices, and oceans.  
  

  * We like to give a lot of ownership both in terms of responsibility and freedom to try new, challenging tasks.  
  

  * Top-notch work equipment.  
  

  * A lot of flexibility for you to work in the way (and place) that suits you best, while making sure we maintain a strong in-office connection.

  * Plenty of social activities... game nights, go climbing with colleagues, Friday bars, big quarterly social events, team fun with dinners out, office BBQs, and more!
