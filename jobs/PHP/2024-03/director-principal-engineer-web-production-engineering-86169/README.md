Description

**About the team:**

The vision for Pfizer‚Äôs Digital function is a more integrated and coordinated healthcare model that improves patient outcomes, fuels tomorrow‚Äôs breakthrough therapies, and brings medicines to patients faster.

Within Pfizer Digital, the Biopharma, Patient & CDI (BPC) group builds solutions for external customers throughout the product lifecycle. We support stakeholders to engage external customers through digital solutions, whether that is patients, HCPs, payors, pharmacists, or clinical sites.

Within BPC, the Platform DevOps team are accountable for the platforms at Pfizer that allow the creation, configuration, launch, and support of all externally facing digital (web, mobile, omni-channel, & device) products, services, and experiences, servicing all external customer types at Pfizer. The Franklin team is responsible for managing up to 9 different products and platforms which makes up Pfizer's Web Publishing platforms for 95% of Pfizer's external facing websites.

Our vision is to innovate and engineer breakthrough digital products to power business performance and transform global health. We do this through our culture of agile, fast-adapting and pioneer working.

 **Role Summary:**

We are seeking a highly skilled and experienced Principal Engineer who will be accountable for technical engineering decisions, solution designs, and delivery, as well as operations of the Production Engineering of the Franklin Platforms and Products. This lead is a key technical role which spans both the development of standards, maintenance of platforms and products, works with the engineering community as well as addresses critical issues with our production platform.

In this technical leadership role, you will act as the executor and the visionary behind technical solutions. You will lead teams of between 10 and 25 technical resources to solve complex engineering problems, craft the technical designs and ensure a successful delivery of high-quality products and services from inception to completion. This role requires exceptional technical knowledge, strong management skills, and the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams while sharing responsibility with the other program leads for achieving the desired objectives.

You will also be accountable for delivery of security-and privacy-first capabilities while creating an environment where engineers can do their best work as measured by a quarterly Developer‚Äôs Experience survey, and alignment and contribution to the service network and technical engineering standards.

 **Key Responsibilities:**

A normal work week consists of leading one or more teams of engineers to deliver and implement technical solutions, following your design approach to meet your assigned program objectives and KPIs. You will also collaborate closely and often with your program Chief Marketing Office Lead, Digital Lead, and Product Owners, to ensure that technical decisions and their implementation align with broader strategic priorities.

You represent engineering in program and stakeholder meetings, as such you‚Äôll need to be able to think on your feet: provide consultation, identify risks based on a variety of factors, and rely on your past experiences to identify potential solutions and develop ballpark estimates. In many situations you will be working with technology that is new to Pfizer and requires you to learn quickly, be able to read and understand documentation, and architect robust and scalable solutions that align with our business objectives.

Using influence more than authority, you will lead teams of engineers on the implementation of the solution. Individual members of the team are responsible for delivering on their commitments, but the team supports each other. The team pride themselves on the quality of their code, our delivery practices and breadth of our test coverage.
