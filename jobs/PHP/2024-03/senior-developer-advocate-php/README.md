We're seeking a Senior PHP Developer Advocate to join our Developer Relations team, driving enablement for MongoDB capabilities in the PHP community.

From startups to Fortune 500 companies, you'll empower developers to integrate advanced data capabilities into their apps and solutions.

### Candidate Profile

We are excited to welcome an influential and established voice in the PHP community to our team.

As an experienced PHP developer, you have produced various types of technical content, such as videos, blog posts, and conference talks. Your content has shared technical insights, led discussions, and inspired others to use best practices. Your passion lies in sharing your knowledge and enabling fellow developers with modern technology and best practices.

Our team is built to work together, share knowledge, and help each other grow. You will work with others at all levels, supporting peer reviews, building demos, delivering sessions, and creating content.

Above all, you should be genuinely passionate about enabling other developers to be more productive and successful in their day-to-day jobs.
