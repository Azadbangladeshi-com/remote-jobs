### **Benefits**

###  **About Twine**

Companies need to hire freelancers such as animators, graphic designers, and software developers but are dissatisfied with existing freelance marketplaces. Existing platforms do not scale beyond hiring a handful of freelancers, they do not help with diversity, and are generally a poor experience for both the client and the freelancer.

Twine is a marketplace that connects companies to a diverse global network of nearly 500,000 creative and digital freelancers. It enables companies to flexibly and ethically scale large teams of freelancers.

Our mission is to empower creators and democratise the freelance workforce to make business more productive.
