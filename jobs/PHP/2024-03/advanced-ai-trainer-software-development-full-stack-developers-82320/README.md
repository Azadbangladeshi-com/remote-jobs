### The Business Context

You already use AI in many ways‚Äîlike deciding what products and services to order‚Äîand it may be most familiar to you as a chatbot, as an avatar-maker, or as a way to unlock your screen. But here‚Äôs what AI may be able to help the world with: finding medical diagnoses, teaching you about scientific research, and calculating the complexities of any function.

But, like humans, algorithms are what they eat. They‚Äôre only as good as the rules they know and the data they‚Äôre trained on. We‚Äôre the team that helps model these behaviors.

  * ### Teaching experience strongly preferred

### Day in and day out, you will:

  * You‚Äôll spend the bulk of your time chatting with the AI, helping it analyze swaths of subject areas and distinguish between what is presented as fact vs. context vs. patterns of behavior. 

  * You will continuously evaluate the AI according to those criteria and our training methods. For example, you will be discerning the accuracy of the facts that the AI is outputting, but also the accuracy with which they interpret them. 

  * You‚Äôll spend substantial amounts of time actively trying to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the AI by ‚Äúforcing‚Äù mistakes and improving the way these AI models recover. This is absolutely critical to its safety, accuracy, and use. You‚Äôll document breaks and have the opportunity to recommend improvements to the training methods themselves to both our team and our client.

### The Person

This is a technology job that accommodates people from diverse educational and professional backgrounds but with a balanced mix of subject matter expertise, higher studies, research experience and teaching/tutoring experience.
