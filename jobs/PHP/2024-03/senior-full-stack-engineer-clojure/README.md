### Splash Financial

Description

### **ABOUT OUR COMPANY:**

The crushing weight of debt is something that we believe holds people back from reaching their dreams and making a splash in the world. So in 2013, after seeing our friends and family struggle with student loans, we created Splash Financial.

Over the years, our mission has expanded to include helping people with other forms of debt - such as refinancing credit cards, which are at all time highs in the US. And weâ€™ve been able to refinance $4+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And weâ€™ve raised over $70 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners and more.

But at our core, weâ€™re still that little company from Cleveland with a big dream: to make people more powerful than their debt and weâ€™re just getting started..

### **ABOUT OUR WORKPLACE:**

Splash is remote-first, and proud of it. We spend our days creating ways to simplify financial products, then get them into the hands of people who need help. Right now, weâ€™re focused on developing financial technologies that fundamentally change the way the industry lends. And to hire the best, we provide the best: great health insurance, competitive salaries, and unique benefits like quarterly meet-ups, access to community and engagement tools. And although weâ€™ve been around since 2013, we still love to think like a start-up â€” a place that empowers good people to do great things, fast.  

Weâ€™re friendly, folksy, and have Slack channels for both #kids-and-pets and #food. Weâ€™re good people who want to make a difference in the financial landscape, and we approach tackling challenges with creativity, passion and urgency.
