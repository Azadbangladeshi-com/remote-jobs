For the past 9 years, weâ€™ve helped cutting-edge companies in the United States and Canada -both large and small, build great development teams and develop great products.

 **What are we looking for?**

In this opportunity, we are looking for a Developer Support Engineer to work with one of our foreign clients, who are providing work with diverse clients in different industries including, Health, Legal, and Automotive.

If you are independent, a great communicator, a problem solver, and have strong attention to detail, this is a great fit for you! Our jobs are fully remote â€“ as long as you have the skills and can get the work done well, you can work anywhere in the listed countries you want.

If you have the skills and can get the job done, join us and work from anywhere you want!

  

 **What's unique about this job?**

As a Developer Support Engineer, youâ€™ll be developing and maintaining an application deployment system that allows microservice-architecture applications to be deployed easily on Kubernetes. An integral part of onboarding business units into this deployment system is converting their existing applications, databases, and supporting services from bare-metal/VM deployments to containers.

### Here are some of the exciting day-to-day challenges you will face in this role:

  * Assist developers in converting their applications to 12-Factor principles so that the apps can run cleanly in a containerized environment, and migrate cleanly from one environment to the next
  * Set up, monitor, and debug CI/CD pipelines constructed in GitLab and Jenkins. This includes Docker container builds managed by bespoke Jenkins libraries, so the job will entail debugging and enhancing these libraries (written in Groovy) from time to time
  * Assist developers in debugging application configuration, code questions, or debugging issues across various languages: PHP, NodeJS, Java, Ruby, .NET Core, and sometimes even Elixir
  * Assist developers in introducing exception reporting and APM metrics into existing and new applications, to improve runtime performance and error monitoring
  * Monitor, tune, and debug issues related to application health and Kubernetes cluster health
  * Identify bugs or shortcomings in the platform and implement solutions to make the IKE Platform better for users and/or easier to maintain

### You will shine if you have these:

  * Git, including management of remotes, branching/merging, and rebasing
  * Basics of Jenkins: Jobs, Pipelines, webhooks
  * Basic RDBMS design and tuning
  * Linux "power user" skills
  *  **Docker concepts:**
  * Builds, including multi-stage builds
  * Layer management and caching
  * Volume management
  * SecurityContainer networking and IPC
  * docker-compose
  * Use of Kubernetes: namespaces, core objects (Deployment, StatefulSet, PersistentVolumes, etc.)
  * Familiarity with configuring and automating Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana dashboards
  *  **Familiarity with principles of web application development:**
  * Configuration by convention (e.g. Rails, Laravel, etc.)
  * Proxying server configurations (Nginx and/Apache)
  * Exception reporting, logging, and performance metrics

### It doesnâ€™t hurt if you also have:

  * Rancher Kubernetes cluster management
  * 12-Factor concepts and their real-life application
  * Familiarity with as many programming languages and frameworks as possible: PHP/Laravel, NodeJS, Java/Spring Boot, Ruby/Rails, .NET Core, Elixir, Rust, Python/Django/Flask, etc.
  * Experience with MVC frameworks in particular

 **Hey, you are still here!**

  

So, let us ask a few questions. Do you like working in a friendly environment? Are you fluent in English? Do you have a strong work ethic, are detail-oriented and have an ownership mentality?
