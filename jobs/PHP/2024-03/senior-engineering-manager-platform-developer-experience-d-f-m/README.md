This position is based in **London** / **Dublin** / **Munich** , or **remotely** inside the **UK, Ireland, Germany.**

At Personio we are on an amazing hypergrowth journey towards becoming the leading HR Platform in Europe! Weâ€™re looking for experienced Software Engineers to join our Product & Technology department, who will play an active role in shaping our engineering culture and the future of thousands of HR teams and organizations across Europe.

Our PHP Developer Experience team sits within our **Developer Experience** (DX) tribe. Collectively within DX we enable other engineers to build, test and deploy code quickly, easily and reliably on their own. We focus on maximizing engineering efficiency, by developing and distributing robust and practical development tools, building scalable DevOps processes, and advocating for software development best practices. As a member of the DX team your focus will be to build tooling solutions which reduce the complexity and risk of developing, deploying and releasing software.

The **Senior Engineering Manager** is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organization. The team supports our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, using a unique mix of skill sets to enable our product engineers to take advantage of everything the platform provides while also minimizing the cognitive load required to do so.

  * You will research, engineer and experiment with new ways to improve developer satisfaction and increase developer velocity by providing efficient, effective tooling and questioning the status quo. 

  * You will foster relationships and partner with product teams to support them through platform specific migrations. Youâ€™ll learn from and understand the challenges they face so that you can translate them into result-oriented solutions that help improve their experience of building software at Personio.

  * You will act as a technical leader and help improve the teamâ€™s engineering culture, defining best practices on how we manage technical debt, refactoring, design patterns and coding principles, code review and pair programming. 

  * You will use your existing experience to help drive the platform forward with new ideas and strategies that help maintain the quality, reliability, security, performance and cost effectiveness of the product and platform.

  * You will partner with other engineering managers across the organisation, keeping them up to date and informed with technical details across multiple projects. Helping to ensure the team is delivering results in an iterative fashion that is driven by impact and promotes a culture of experimentation and shipping to learn.

  * This list has a lot of the things weâ€™re looking for, but we donâ€™t expect everyone to tick every box. If you donâ€™t feel like you hit every one of them, weâ€™d encourage you to apply anyway.

    * You have 5+ years of management experience. Youâ€™ve managed and grown high-performing teams, and learned from your failures.

    * Your strong leadership skills attract, motivate, and inspire new engineers to achieve exceptional results.

    * You can lead and make decisions to push forward. Youâ€™re comfortable owning even the most ambiguous problems and defining the road ahead.

    * You have a strong expertise with working with PHP codebases (ideally, but not necessarily Laravel). In particular youâ€™re comfortable with the intricacies of their build ecosystems (build tools, tasks, runners, etc.).

    * You excel at designing, building, documenting and distributing robust and delightful solutions in the form of services, CLI tools, scripts & plugins for developers.

    * Youâ€™re opinionated on development processes and best practices (merge requests, approvals, trunk-based vs branch-based development, etc), and are eager to optimize and automate them.

    * You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services, and you understand the value of writing great technical documentation and useful tutorials.

    * You are data driven and are passionate about using metrics to define and evaluate your engineering design decisions.

    * You have an excellent written and spoken English (level C1/C2 on the CEFR scale)

    * You embrace feedback - no one is perfect, neither are we. So letâ€™s make this an opportunity to praise and learn from each other.

Personio is an equal opportunities employer, committed to building an integrative culture where everyone feels welcomed and supported. We embrace uniqueness and understand that our diverse, values-driven culture makes us stronger. We are proud to have an inclusive workplace environment that will foster your development no matter your gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, education level, or race.

Aside from our people, culture, and mission, check out some of the other benefits that make Personio a great place to work:

  * Receive a competitive reward package â€“ reevaluated each year â€“ that includes salary, benefits, and pre-IPO equity
  * Enjoy 28 days of paid vacation, plus an additional day after 2 and 4 years (because we love what we do, but we also love vacation!)
  * Make an impact on the environment and society with 2 (fully paid) Impact Days â€“ one for an individual project of your choice and one for a company-wide initiative
  * Receive generous family leave, child support, mental health support, and sabbatical opportunities with PersonioCares
  * Find your best way to work with our office-led, remote-friendly PersonioFlex! Most teams offer a roughly 50% remote, 50% in-office working framework
  * Invest in your development with an annual personal development budget to use on professional memberships, external certifications, conferences, and more
  * Connect with your fellow Personios at regular company and team events like All Company Culture Week and local year-end celebrations
  * Engage in a high-impact working environment with flat hierarchies and short decision-making processes
