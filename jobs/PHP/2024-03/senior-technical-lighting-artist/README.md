Tripwire Interactive is looking for talented, dedicated, and passionate individuals to join our team. We started out in 2005 as a independent video game developer and publisher, known for first-person shooters like _Red Orchestra_ , the wildly popular _Killing Floor_ series, and more recently, the action RPG _Maneater_. In 2022 Tripwire was acquired and became a part of the Embracer Group through its wholly owned subsidiary Saber Interactive. Over the years Tripwire has solidified its place as one of the games industry‚Äôs leading independent developers and maintains the ability to work on our own timetables to craft games with a singular voice that reflects our own unique vision. We‚Äôre located in Roswell, GA, a historic suburb of Atlanta, where living is affordable and proximity to the city provides for plenty of opportunities. We believe in a collaborative work environment where team members are encouraged to take risks and push the boundaries of our medium. If that sounds like
something you could get into, we'd love to hear from you!

Without a doubt, our office is an awesome place to work, but at Tripwire we recognize that the true ‚Äúoffice‚Äù exists both inside and outside of our state-of-the-art facility. With our brand new ‚ÄúNext-Gen‚Äù Remote Work policy, we are able to remain fully productive regardless of what the world throws at us by allowing all employees to choose whether they‚Äôd like to work in-office, at home, or a bit of both. This program has been designed to give all Tripwire employees the tools to help them deliver their best work. For more information on Tripwire‚Äôs Next-Gen Remote Work Policy click here.
