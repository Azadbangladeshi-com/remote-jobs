### Huntress  
#### `üí∞ 160000.0` `üåé United States`  

### Reports to: Manager, Security Operations Center

 **Location: Remote US -** **Must be based in the Western US timezone**

 **Compensation Range: $75,000 to $85,000 base plus bonus and equity**

### What We Do:

Founded in 2015 as a fully remote company by former NSA cyber operators, Huntress was built on a simple premise: to force hackers to earn every inch of their access.

Today‚Äôs cyber-attacks aren‚Äôt limited to large organizations with the security tools that can ward off threats. Hackers don't discriminate and will find a way to penetrate any vulnerability in any size business, which is why Huntress focuses on protecting those small to midsize businesses that make up the backbone of our economy.

Huntress stops hidden threats that sneak past preventive security tools by utilizing our award-winning security platform and expert human threat hunters through dynamic products including Managed EDR, MDR for Microsoft 365, and Managed Security Awareness Training.

Join the hunt and help us stop hackers in their tracks!

### What You‚Äôll Do:

Do you like puzzles or do you like to take things apart to figure out how they work and then put them back together? Or do you look at everyday things and ask, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and try to improve them? Or perhaps you enjoy researching security-related topics and sharing your findings/knowledge with people to help them grow? If so, then keep reading!

The Huntress SOC team has the unique honor of waking up every morning knowing we‚Äôre going to make hackers regret targeting our partners and customers. As a SOC Analyst, we‚Äôre looking for someone who wants to be at the frontlines countering these constantly evolving threats. Experience with large-scale data categorization and classification, host-based threat hunting, malware analysis, and incident response are additional ways to differentiate yourself.
