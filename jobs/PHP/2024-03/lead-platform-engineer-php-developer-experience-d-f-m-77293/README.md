The PHP DX Platform Engineer is a high-impact, cross-functional role at the heart of our engineering organization. The team supports our internal engineering teams throughout the complete development lifecycle of Personio, using a unique mix of skill sets to enable our product engineers to take advantage of everything the platform provides while also minimizing the cognitive load required to do so.

### Role Responsibilities: What you'll do

  * Your scope will encompass the entire process of building , testing, deploying, releasing, and monitoring PHP services across all environments, from the local machine straight through to our production clusters.
  * You will foster relationships and partner with product teams to support them through platform specific migrations. You‚Äôll learn from and understand the challenges they face so that you can translate them into result-oriented solutions that help improve their experience of building software at Personio.
  * You will act as a technical leader to your teammates and help improve the team‚Äôs engineering culture, defining best practices on how we manage technical debt, refactoring, design patterns and coding principles, code review and pair programming. 
  * You will mentor and coach other engineers to grow into the next generation of technical leaders
  * You will use your existing experience to help drive the platform forward with new ideas and strategies that help maintain the quality, reliability, security, performance and cost effectiveness of the product and platform.

Helping to ensure the team is delivering results in an iterative fashion that is driven by impact and promotes a culture of experimentation and shipping to learn.

### Role Requirements: What you need to succeed

  * You have leadership experience having previously acted as a mentor or role model to other engineers. Ideally leading pair and mob programming sessions, as well as setting up and running technical brainstorming and solution design sessions.
  * You strike a balance between a strategic and tactical mindset. You are capable of working with your engineering manager to translate the platform's strategic vision into tactical, achievable objectives for the team.
  * You have a strong expertise with working with PHP codebases (ideally Laravel). In particular you‚Äôre comfortable with the intricacies of their build ecosystems (build tools, tasks, runners, etc.).
  * You excel at designing, building, documenting and distributing robust and delightful solutions in the form of services, CLI tools, scripts & plugins for developers.
  * You‚Äôre opinionated on development processes and best practices (merge requests, approvals, trunk-based vs branch-based development, etc), and are eager to optimize and automate them.
  * You want to work with a very technical team on developer-facing tools and services, and you understand the value of writing great technical documentation and useful tutorials.
  * You are data driven and are passionate about using metrics to define and evaluate your engineering design decisions.
