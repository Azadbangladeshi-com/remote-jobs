The PayPal SDK Engineering team is seeking to reinvent the way we pay online. Our team is responsible for enabling merchants around the world to accept payments within their mobile apps and websites. We always keep developers and their needs at the top of our mind and strive to provide the best-in-class developer experience.  
  
We are looking for highly talented and self-driven engineers to join our team! In this role, you will be developing and enabling new payment methods and features for PayPalâ€™s Server SDKs.

Weâ€™re looking for someone who is eager to learn and able to master many technologies and has a strong focus on empathizing and understanding what developers need.

 **Job Description:**

Your day to day:

* Building and maintaining PayPalâ€™s Server SDKs

* Working with stakeholders across Braintree and PayPal to create simple, robust Server SDKs that enables all PayPal has to offer.

* Partnering closely with cross functional partners in design and product.

* Providing feedback on code and contributing to architecture discussions.

* Engaging with internal and external developers to better understand developer pain points and ways to improve the developer experience.

What you need to bring:

* Experience building web applications and services

* Willingness to work in a variety of languages (Ruby, Python, PHP, etc...)

* Experience in developer-facing products (e.g. SDKs, REST APIs, GraphQL) or products that enable third-party application development are great to have but not required.

* Excited about our team's focus on open source and improving developer experiences.

* Experience with or interest in working with a team of engineers

* Keep up to date on industry trends and technologies and apply them to our products.

Your way to impact:

* Engineers build, test, release and monitor their own code.

* We pair program often. We believe that we do our best work when we work and collaborate together.

* We default to async communication and call for meetings when necessary.

* We hold daily stand-ups and have regular retrospectives to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements. 

* We value unique perspectives brought by diverse backgrounds and experiences. A broad range of ideas and perspectives help us to create the best possible product and work environment. 

Types of projects we work on:

* We do a lot of open-source development as our SDKs are in public GitHub. We also contribute to other open-source projects.

* We build and support PayPalâ€™s SDKs (including Braintree and PayPal), which are the primary way for a merchant to accept payments on their websites and mobile apps.

* We are launching new and interesting ways to pay through our SDKs.

* We create easy-to-use developer tools that supplement our SDKs and Integrations.

* We are focused on improving the developer experience by engaging with the external developer community, creating tutorials, blogs, and speaking at conferences.
