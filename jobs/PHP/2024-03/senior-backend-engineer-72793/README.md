# [Senior Backend Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-backend-engineer-72793)  
### Famly  
#### `ðŸŒŽ EMEA Only`  

**Headquarters:** Copenhagen, Denmark  
**URL:** https://famly.co

**Job description  
**  

At Famly, weâ€™re looking for a Senior Scala Backend Engineer to build awesome GraphQL and REST APIs to enable our platform to help the thousands of daycares that use Famly.  
  

We are looking for people in the following locations:  
  

  * Copenhagen, Denmark  
  

  * Berlin, Germany (Remote)  
  

  * UK (Remote)  
  

  * Lisbon, Portugal (Remote)  
  

If you aren't in any of these locations, do consider applying, we're always open if the right candidate comes by.  
  

And Famly are...? Well it all began when our co-founder Henrikâ€™s daughter was ready to start at daycare. He couldnâ€™t believe the amount of work being done on paper - and how distant he felt from his first child during the day. The paper â€˜parentâ€™ books they exchanged once a month just werenâ€™t cutting it. Together with his friend, our co-founder and CEO Anders, they set about solving that.  
  

These days, the 140 of us building Famly talk about trying to do two things for our 6,500 nurseries:  
  

  * Giving children the best possible start to life.  
  

  * Championing the vital work that goes into making that happen.  
  

We do it with software that brings hundreds of thousands of parents closer to their childâ€™s day while theyâ€™re away from them. We also make financial, pedagogical, and planning tools for more than 34,000 childcare professionals, saving them hours and reducing their admin stress.  
  

Ultimately, that gives them more time and headspace for the little ones that really matter. Come help us make that happen.  
  

**  
What you'll be doing:**

  * Working in our Finance & Payments crew with other Frontenders, Backenders, a Designer, a Product manager and an Engineering manager.  
  

  * You will play a key role in planning whatâ€™s next, designing, developing and rolling out cool new features and changes.  
  

  * Youâ€™ll team up with the Backend Chapter to shape the future of our tech stack, tooling and reducing complexity across our code.

  

**Youâ€™ll thrive in this role if you can:**

  * Build solid APIs in GraphQL and REST (we primarily use Scala with our GraphQL API but also maintain a PHP REST API)
  * Use functional programming (we use cats, cats-effect, fs2, refined, and slick)  
  

  * Model complex data structures and express them in a relational way (we use MySQL)  
  

  * Bring crystal clarity to complex and ambiguous ideas and projects.  
  

  * Communicate feedback, expectations and information in clear and kind ways, both written and spoken (weâ€™re over 40 different nationalities, and our company language is English)  
  

  * Learn super fast, be open-minded and ready to adapt our technology, teams and ways-of-working as Famly scales in brave new directions.  
  

  * Make your teammates shine by supporting each other to learn and grow.  
  

Weâ€™re looking for **senior people** , and we appreciate that everyone brings something unique, **so even if you donâ€™t tick every box, please still apply.**

  

**  
Youâ€™ll love working here because:**

  * You get a clear career framework and coaching to make sure youâ€™re growing, a 10,000 DKK personal development budget and a â€˜Weâ€™ll buy you any book you wantâ€™ policy.  
  

  * Weâ€™re all about hiring a diverse array of clever people - who are kind and good humans too. It means Famly is full of top thinkers and generous teammates waiting to help you shine.  
  

  * A value of â€˜make your colleagues shine' is all about breaking down silos, celebrating one another, and staying connected across departments, offices, and oceans.  
  

  * We like to give a lot of ownership both in terms of responsibility and freedom to try new, challenging tasks.  
  

  * Top-notch work equipment.  
  

  * A lot of flexibility for you to work in the way (and place) that suits you best, while making sure we maintain a strong in-office connection.  
  

**  
If you join from outside Copenhagen:  
**  

Weâ€™re currently around 140 people, and around 30 in Engineering. We started as a Copenhagen office-based company, but as we are scaling weâ€™re heading on our journey towards a fully hybrid way of working in Engineering.  
  

  * 1 week of onboarding to meet all your new colleagues (we will of course fly you in and get a hotel in wonderful Copenhagen for you)  
  

  * 2 tech meetups on-site every year (we will again fly you in and ensure everything is taken care of)  
  

**  
If you're in the Copenhagen HQ, we also have:  
**  

  * Daily buffet and a well-stocked drinks fridge (did someone say snack corner?)  
  

  * Plenty of social activities... game nights, go climbing with colleagues, Friday bars, big quarterly social events, team fun with dinners out, office BBQs, and more!  
  

**The interview process is:  
**  

  1. An intro video chat with our People Partner  
  

  2. Logical test  
  

  3. Take home technical assignment with a follow-up chat  
  

  4. Personal interview  
  

  
  

We're looking to fill the position as soon as possible, so get your application in today by sending us:  
  

  * Your CV  
  

  * A cover letter to tell us what you can bring to the role, and what speaks to you about Famly.  
  

Looking forward to hearing from you!
