## Who we are

### About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesâ€”from the worldâ€™s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsâ€”use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyoneâ€™s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

### About the team

Large, complex businesses on Stripe have historically had to create a new Stripe account for each global entity or business unitâ€”making it difficult to unify reporting and manage payment operations across all accounts. Our customers want a way to manage these accounts under one umbrella so they can operate at scale more efficiently.

We are responsible for building Organizations, which allows merchants to effectively and centrally manage their businesses across multiple Stripe accounts. As Stripe continues to grow its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Organizations will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe. We will do this by enabling our platforms and businesses to model their complex businesses and distribute all of Stripeâ€™s products to their end users.

## What youâ€™ll do

As a backend engineer, you will design and build platforms & services that are configurable and scalable around the globe. You will partner with many functions at Stripe, with the opportunity to both work on infrastructure/platform systems, as well as produce direct user-facing business impact.

Organizations is one of Stripeâ€™s biggest bets. You will be joining a team with an ambitious and exciting goal at an early stage, with several opportunities to solve complex engineering problems at scale. If this sounds exciting, weâ€™d love to speak with you.
