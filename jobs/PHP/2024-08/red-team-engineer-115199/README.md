## Description

 **If you have fallen and risen, if you have broken and fixed, if you have dreamt and built, then you have grit. Then we speak the same language. Welcome to the Wolfpack.**

  

 **About CloudWalk:**

We are one of the fastest growing fintechs on the planet. We kick ass. A unicorn, with millions of happy customers, a hardcore team, and hundreds of millions in funding and revenue. But not your typical startup.

We build and learn, fast, and we want the hackers, the artists, the crafters - join the Wolfpack!

  

 **About the team**

 **Do you enjoy the thrill of the hunt? Are you passionate about cybersecurity and uncovering weaknesses in systems? If so, then join our team as a Red Team Engineer!**

In this critical role, you will play a vital part in strengthening our organization's security posture by acting as a simulated attacker. You'll be responsible for planning and executing red teaming exercises, essentially ethical hacking engagements that mimic real-world cyberattacks.

  

 **About the team**

 **Do you enjoy the thrill of the hunt? Are you passionate about cybersecurity and uncovering weaknesses in systems? If so, then join our team as a Red Team Engineer!**

In this critical role, you will play a vital part in strengthening our organization's security posture by acting as a simulated attacker. You'll be responsible for planning and executing red teaming exercises, essentially ethical hacking engagements that mimic real-world cyberattacks.

  

### What You'll Be Doing:

*  **Become the adversary:** Think like a malicious actor! You'll design and execute red teaming exercises, employing various attack techniques like social engineering, phishing, and penetration testing to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems and networks.
*  **Uncover the cracks in the armor:** Your keen eye will be essential in identifying weaknesses across our IT infrastructure. You'll leverage your expertise to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence within a compromised system, just like a real attacker would.
*  **Turn knowledge into action:** Your discoveries are valuable! You'll document your findings in detail, including recommendations for remediation. This will help us patch vulnerabilities and significantly improve our overall security posture.

  

###  What You Need To Succeed:

* Experience in planning and executing red teaming engagements.
* Strong understanding of ethical hacking methodologies and penetration testing techniques (e.g., social engineering, phishing, SQL injection).
* In-depth knowledge of system and network vulnerabilities.
* Excellent communication and collaboration skills to work effectively with internal security and engineering teams.
* Ability to document findings clearly and concisely.
* Excellent communication skills in English.

  

 **Bonus points if you have:**

* Experience with exploit development and automation tools. 
* Knowledge of specific industry security threats and compliance requirements

  

We are not expecting candidates to have expertise across all of these areas. We will gladly help you bridge the gaps.

As a member of a fully remote and distributed team, you are expected to complete tasks autonomously, being highly collaborative and self-driven.

  

 **Diversity and Inclusion**

We believe in social inclusion, respect, and appreciation of all people. We promote a welcoming work environment, where each CloudWalker can be authentic, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion, sexuality, mobility, disability, or education.
