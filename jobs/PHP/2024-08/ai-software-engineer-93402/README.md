## **About Siena**

Siena is building enterprise empathic AI Agents powered by reasoning-adept LLMs. Siena is the first AI Agent of its kind, designed to integrate with existing systems and interact with customers across multiple channels from a single, unified platform.

If you're excited about the intersection of human-to-machine communication and want to be part of a team driving innovation and making a real impact in automating agentic workflows, join us on our mission to revolutionize customer experience through empathetic AI.

##  **Some of our values**

We're not big on corporate-speak, but here's what matters to us:

  *  **We put customers first** : We work hard to understand our customers. We try to put ourselves in their position and do more than they expect.

  *  **We're direct and honest** : We believe in straightforward, truthful communication. We say what we think, clearly and respectfully.

  *  **We try new things** : We're not afraid to do things differently if it means finding better solutions.

  *  **We step up** : When we see a chance to make a difference, we take it. We trust ourselves to decide and take responsibility for what happens.

  *  **We're quick on our feet** : We adapt to changes and challenges. We see them as chances to learn and grow.

  *  **We stay curious** : We ask questions and explore new ideas. What we learn helps us keep growing.

  *  **We own it** : We're all owners here. We take charge, make the call, and own the outcome. 

## **About the role**

You'll have a lot of freedom here. We're a small team, so your decisions will matter. You'll build things that become central to our product, and you'll have a strong voice in where we go next. This is a chance to do work that matters, with a team that moves fast.

##  **What you'll do**

  * Build new features from zero to one

  * Make our core product better

  * Build the primitives our AI uses to think and act

  * Design systems where multiple AIs work together to solve complex problems

  * Develop evaluation frameworks to rigorously test our system's performance

  * Identify new approaches to build things that haven't been built before. Your research could open up entirely new possibilities for our product

##  **Who we're looking for**

  * You have a track record of 4+ years building AI/ML products that work in the real world

  * You write code that's both clean and fast

  * You know the latest AI/ML frameworks and production deployment

  * You can explain complex ideas in simple terms

##  **You should be**

  * Excited about using AI to change how work gets done and the world interacts with brands

  * Excellent at turning ambiguous ideas into concrete plans

  * Able to zoom in and out: from tiny details to big picture

  * Someone who gets a lot done, quickly

##  **Why Joins Us**

We're a startup. We can't offer you fancy offices or extra perks. But here's what we can offer:

  * Real impact. Your work will directly shape our product and company.

  * A seat at the table. In a small team, every voice matters. Yours will be heard.

  * Freedom to work your way. Home, coffee shop, moon base - if you're productive, we're happy.

  * Top pay. Competitive salary and an opportunity for equity or stock grants. 

  * Time off when you need it. Take at least 15 days. More if you need it. 

  * Budget to keep learning. Because if you're not growing, we're not growing.

  * The chance to build something from the ground up. This is the time when what you do has the biggest impact.

  * Problems worth solving. We're reshaping how work gets done.

At Siena, weâ€™re not just looking for people who can do a job. Weâ€™re looking for people who want to break boundaries, create the future, and reshape industries. If thatâ€™s you, we look forward to your application.

Siena provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.
