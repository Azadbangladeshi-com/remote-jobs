We are looking for a **Senior Machine Learning Engineer** to contribute to this vision and reap the rewards of joining an exciting company in the high growth phase. Among other things, Fetch uses ML/AI to power receipt understanding (digital and physical), fraud detection, and weâ€™re rapidly evolving in the space of ads ranking, recommendation, search, and discovery. Machine learning is core to our product and weâ€™re working to make it an even bigger part of the company.

Have you lost entire days debugging inscrutable CUDA errors?** If you answered yes to these questions weâ€™d love to hear from you.

**Technical Skills:**

  * Excellent programming skills (we use a lot of **Python** in this problem space but proficiency in other languages are equally welcome)
  * Experience training ML models using a **Python** framework like Pytorch, TensorFlow, etc.
