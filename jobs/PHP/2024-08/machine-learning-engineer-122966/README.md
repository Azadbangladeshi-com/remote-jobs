 **What you'll do:**

  * You will build and deploy machine learning models in production that tangibly impact the lives of our customers

  * You will be a strategic partner for leaders across the organization on driving business impact through machine learning

  * Build strong partnerships with product teams to understand and proactively address future technology needs and current developer pain points

  * Industry or research experience in NLP, information retrieval, or entity resolution

  * Ability to communicate technical ideas or issues in easy-to-understand and actionable terms

Our goal is to empower every team member to contribute to our mission of fostering a more just world, regardless of their role, location, or level of experience. To that end, we offer:

  * Choice of medical, dental, and vision insurance plans for you and your family

  * Flexible paid time off and 10+ holidays per year

  * A stipend to upgrade your home office for fully-remote roles

  * 401k for US-based employees

 **About EvenUp:**

EvenUp is a venture-backed generative AI startup that ensures injury victims are awarded the full value of their claims, expanding the $100B+ in awards granted to injury victims each year. Every year, the legal system has made it difficult for millions of ordinary people to seek justice, especially for folks without means or who come from underrepresented backgrounds. Our vision is to help these injury victims get the justice they deserve, irrespective of their income, demographics, or the quality of their legal representation.

EvenUp operates across a variety of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents and negligence claims. Our ML-driven software empowers attorneys to accurately assess the value of these cases by doing a core part of their workflow (legal drafting), enabling them to secure larger settlements in record time. As EvenUp evaluates more cases, our proprietary data grows, enhancing the precision of our predictions and delivering more value to both attorneys and victims alike.

  
We are one of the fastest growing startups ($0 to $10M in ARR in <2 years) and are funded by some of the best investors in the world, including Signalfire, Bain, and Bessemer, who led our recent $50M Series B.
