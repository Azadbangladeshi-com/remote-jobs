Discord is about giving people the power to create space to find belonging in their lives. We want to make it easier for you to talk regularly with the people you care about. We want you to build genuine relationships with your friends and communities close to home or around the world. Original, reliable, playful, and relatable. These are the values that connect our users and our employees at Discord.

We are looking for a highly technical, creative, hands-on, and impact-focused Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Ads team.

Our team is revolutionizing the way users interact with our platform through innovative ads formats (including Quests). We are driven by a passion for delivering exceptional user experiences while scaling our platform to new heights. These products enable us to generate revenue by building a win-win-win suite of distribution tools for game developers, players, and Discord. Join us in shaping the future of digital advertising and marketplace interactions.

**What you'll do**

  * Design, build and maintain new Ads products and infrastructure from the backend to frontend. Collaborate with both engineers on and off the team - from Revenue Infrastructure, to Core Tech, to Machine Learning, to Data Science.
  * Be a strategic partner with engineering, product, and cross functional leadership in designing, developing and scaling digital advertising features that drive revenue growth and enhance user engagement.
  * Architect simple and maintainable systems to enable us to launch quickly and iterate while sustaining a high product and technical quality bar.
  * Model strong ownership by acting autonomously when possible and looping in others to build confidence on critical questions. Introduce coding and operational best practices to the team; always be learning & teaching.
  * Own projects end to end â€” youâ€™ll be responsible for working with Product and other stakeholders to refine requirements, creating technical designs and specs, implementing changes, and seeing projects through to launch and maintenance.  
  

**What we look for**

  * **A focus on impact.** You have a sharp eye for what changes can bring a product from good to great. You collaborate closely with product managers, designers, analysts, and other engineers to define great solutions to business problems.
  * **A sense of ownership.** You believe in solving a problem completely rather than simply shipping a solution. You operate autonomously and follow through on your commitments.
  * **A growth mindset.** You view mistakes as learning opportunities and build upon your successes. You challenge yourself and those around you to continuously improve.
  * **A love of mentorship.** Helping fellow engineers, providing feedback and guidance on system architecture, API design, data modeling, and tradeoffs.
  * **Domain knowledge.** Weâ€™re looking for engineers with experience in the ad delivery space.
  * 4+ years of experience, with 2 years in relevant roles  
  

**Bonus Points**

  * Expertise with Typescript, React, React Native, Python and/or Rust
  * Familiarity with experimentation and analysis
  * Contributions to open-source projects
  * Interest or passion for the Discord platform
