## **Why this job is exciting**

We recently created a machine learning team at Sourcegraph, aimed at creating the most powerful coding assistant in the world. Many companies are trying, but Sourcegraph is uniquely differentiated by our rich code intelligence data and powerful code search platform. In the world of prompting LLMs, context is everything, and Sourcegraph‚Äôs context is simply the best you can get: IDE-quality, global-scale, and served lightning fast. Our code intelligence, married with modern AI, is already providing a remarkable alpha experience, and you can help us unlock its full potential.

We are looking for an experienced full-stack ML engineer with demonstrated industry experience in productionizing large-scale ML models in industrial settings. And if you happen to have an entrepreneurial streak, you‚Äôre in luck: We have an enterprise distribution pipeline, so whatever you build can be deployed straight to enterprise customers with some of the largest code bases in the world, without all the go-to-market hassle you‚Äôd encounter in a startup.

You will be an engineer at Sourcegraph doing R&D, and pushing the boundaries of what AI can do, as an IC on our ML team. You will have the full power of Sourcegraph‚Äôs Code Intelligence Platform at your disposal, and you‚Äôll be working on a coding assistant to multiply dev productivity to unprecedented levels.

üìÖ Within one month, you will‚Ä¶

  * Start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure.
  * Be set up to do local development, and be actively prototyping.
  * Dive deep into how AI and ML is already used at Sourcegraph and identify ways to improve moving forward.
  * Develop simulated datasets using Gym style frameworks across a number of Cody use cases.
  * Experiment with changes to Cody prompts, context sources and evaluate the changes with offline experimentation datasets.
  * Ship a substantial new feature to end users.

üìÖ Within three months, you will‚Ä¶

üìÖ Within six months, you will‚Ä¶

  * Be fully ramped up and owning key pieces of the assistant.
  * Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Sourcegraph product.
  * Be helping design and build what might become the biggest dev accelerator in 20 years.
  * Owning a number of ML systems, and building core data and model metadata systems powering the end-to-end ML lifecycle.
  * Be developing a highly scalable, high-QPS inference service providing low latency performance using a mix of CPU and GPU hardware to most efficiently utilize resources.
  * Be driving the technical vision and owning a couple of major ML components, including their modeling and ML infra roadmap.

## **About you**

You are an experienced full-stack ML engineer with demonstrated industry experience in formulating ML solutions, developing end-to-end data orchestration pipelines, deploying large-scale ML models, and experimenting offline and online to drive business impact for Cody users. You want to be part of a world-class team to push the boundaries of AI, with a particular focus on leveraging Sourcegraph‚Äôs code intelligence to leapfrog competitors.
