### ü§ù HELP US HELP THE WORLD AGREE FASTER

Juro has big ambitions: to become the go-to platform for agreeing and managing contracts globally. And we'll need help doing it.

Legal tech is on the rise, with Goldman Sachs estimating that 44% of legal tasks can be automated with generative AI. With the brand we have built and the agility of early stage we are well placed to capture this opportunity.

### üå† YOUR MISSION

We're looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our Contract Repository team. The team‚Äôs mission is to enable customers to organise all of their contracts in one, secure place, be augmented with insights and query their contract data instantly.

As part of this team, you will focus on creating a seamless experience for new Juro customers and counterparties. Day to day, you will face non-trivial tasks and problems that require creativity and critical thinking to solve. Some of the upcoming tasks and projects that you will be involved in:

**1\. Building from scratch** and **improving existing features** in the dashboard - the application's main user interface - to enhance user engagement and usability.

**2.** Designing and developing new, innovative features for **document organisation**.

**3\. Solving problems** in collaboration with other engineering teams and designers to create the best **user experience**.

**4\. Improving the existing code** base of the whole product using **TypeScript.**

**5\. Creating React components** for new features.

### üèî WHY JOIN US?

### üõ†Ô∏è **You decide what is best.**

The PDE teams have autonomy to make decisions and carry out work that solves the problems for our customers.

### ü¶ñ **No legacy technologies.**

We use a modern stack like TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis. As a bonus, you will have debugging tools like Sentry, Greylog, Grafana.

üí• **Make an impact.**

We are still small team ‚Äî ca. 5 engineers, QA, design and product per workstream. As a result, your impact on what we build will be significant: you will see results of your work not in months, but weeks.

üîß **Time to fix.**

Every month we have team retro - if you see a problem, something doesn‚Äôt work for you, or you want to improve anything - we have a space for this.

Technical debt and bugs are taken seriously and time is allocated to resolve both.

### üëÄ **Code review to help you grow.**

We will help you make your code better on code reviews and expect same from you to help us to make our code better

### üõ†Ô∏è **GitHub**

Our code is on GitHub, where we leverage the full suite of GitHub functionalities, including GitHub Actions, to automate testing, building, releasing, and any other processes we can streamline. Additionally, we provide access to GitHub Copilot, empowering our team with AI-powered coding assistance

Join a scaleup that wins awards **for its culture**.

The public recognition Juro receives is a result of hard work‚Äîshowing rather than just telling‚Äîand our commitment to making Juro the best workplace. This involves taking concrete steps to become a truly diverse and inclusive environment, investing in a culture of growth, and providing flexibility for everyone, among other initiatives.

Like any growing company, we constantly iterate and refine the employee-employer relationship. This includes the benefits we offer, how we give and receive feedback, and creating an environment where all Jurors feel a sense of belonging and can bring their full selves to work.

  * **Mentoring:** You use your technical expertise to teach others patiently, who come to you for your knowledge.
  * **Caring:** You take responsibility for what you build because you care, and you proactively seek/give feedback to suggest improvements
  * **Autonomy:** You learn fast and don't require a lot of supervision to work well. When you ask questions, it's to re-confirm what you work on and then continue on independently.
  * **Focus on results:** You deliver the tasks and projects that you promise, and you don't invent new solutions if an appropriate one already exists.

**On top of that, you have been part of a journey where:**

  * Good understanding of and experience with native DOM API‚Äôs (e.g. dragdrop, element positioning, scrolling, etc)
