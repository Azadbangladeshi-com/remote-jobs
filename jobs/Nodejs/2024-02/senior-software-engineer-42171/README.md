### Glean  
#### `💰 65k-95k USD` `🌎 UK`  

**Hi 👋 we’re Glean.** We make study software that improves your confidence and ability to learn.

  * We’re a SaaS scale up and one of the fastest growing tech companies in the North. 
  * There’s 100+ of us around the UK with our HQ in Leeds. 
  * Our software is award-winning and used by 100,000s of students at over 800 universities & colleges worldwide. 
  * We’ve been rated an outstanding company to work for by Best Companies. 
  * We’re growing so we can achieve our mission to support 1 million students to become better learners by 2026. 

**The role of Senior Engineer:**

Glean are looking for a talented, passionate Software Engineer who wants to be part of a small, beautifully formed and growing engineering team. We are focussed on pragmatic delivery with quality at the centre of everything we do. We use a mixture of front-end (TypeScript, React), back-end technologies (JVM / Kotlin), and mobile (Flutter) technologies with an automated build pipeline (Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm). We are trusted by the business to own our technology stack and processes and repay this trust by delivering regularly and predictably. We aspire to be the best engineering team we can be, by constantly asking, "given what we know now, is there anything we should change?".

**Meet the team:**

Technology at Glean is a cross-functional function made of Engineering, Product, Product Marketing, User Experience and Data. This filters down to our product squads where we have at least one team member from each discipline working together to build the best product for our users and customers. You’ll be joining one of three stream-aligned squads; BEAR (Buyers, Evaluators, Admins & Resellers), Note-taking or, Learning (known internally as LEggs).

You’ll be managed by one of the Engineering Line Managers; Blake (tennis player, drummer), Bruce (makes the most of our remote policy, a man with a large vocabulary), Chris (good dog owner, amazingly organised), Colin (bass player in Glean Bandit, Pokemon wizard) or Mark (Nomad policy champion, Glean Pride organiser) who are all Software Engineers or Platform Engineers themselves. Heading up the line managers is Gwen, the Head of Engineering. If you want to know more about the Engineering culture at Glean, you can hear from Gwen on our Employee Spotlight blog!

**What you’ll be doing:**

As a Software Engineer your role involves collaborating in a multi-disciplinary squad to build, implement and support software that brings value to our users and customers while aligning to our Engineering Principles. Reporting to an Engineering Line Manager, your responsibilities include:

**Responsibilities - Technical**

  * Craft clean and efficient code based on requirements.
  * Create maintainable code.
  * Focus on testability of delivered solutions.
  * Integrate software components and third-party tools.
  * Verify and deploy programs and systems.
  * Troubleshoot, debug and upgrade existing software.
  * Recommend and execute technical improvements.
  * Learn and develop your technical expertise in areas relevant to Glean. 
  * Support releases as they progress through test environments to production (live) environments.

**Responsibilities - Interpersonal**

  * Foster a fun, safe environment for engineering based upon trust, collaboration and respect.
  * Mentor other engineers when you have domain expertise that they have yet to acquire.
  * Passionate views, loosely held - argue your point of view passionately but be willing to accept that the needs of others or the group or the business may mean that other approaches are adopted.
  * Assume we are all well intentioned and want the best for Glean. 

**About you:**

  * Strong programming skills (object oriented and/ or functional).
  * Front end technologies HTML5, CSS and JavaScript frameworks (we mainly use TypeScript and React).
  * Mobile technologies (we use Flutter).
  * Persistence (mainly SQL, specifically PostgreSQL), some NoSQL.
  * Knowledge of best practices in automated testing, continuous integration, automated deployment, code quality etc.

Not every one of the above is essential, but hopefully it gives an idea of what we find useful day to day.
