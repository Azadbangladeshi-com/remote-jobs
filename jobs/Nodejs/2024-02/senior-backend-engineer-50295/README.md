At Fonoa, we are transforming how digital-first companies stay tax compliant. We provide simple and modular API solutions that easily integrate into any existing workflow. Through our technology first approach, we reduce manual processes, increase compliance and reduce the cost of operations when transacting and scaling internationally.

We are solving one of the largest yet unsolved problems in global e-commerce. Our tax automation software enables companies such as Uber, Zoom, Booking.com, Squarespace and Rappi to expand their international offerings more quickly and stay tax compliant.

 **Engineering plays a very central part in the business.**

As a company with ambitions to be a world-class API solution for all things tax, we value quality over quantity when building. We also care about creating scalable, easy-to-operate, and maintainable software that our customers and daily users can rely on.

Some pointers about our engineering culture:

  * Engineers are given customer problems to solve rather than features to build.
  * We understand the customer's needs before considering implementation details.
  * Engineers are owners of their past, present and future; architecture, tools, coding, testing, deployment, operations and scaling
  * We work in lean, small teams. We co-own the product roadmap with product managers
  * We choose collaboration, compassion, and trust over individualism and politics
  * We prefer innovation, constant iteration and trust over competition and perfect solutions.
  * We support each other, are kind by nature, and give as much feedback as possible to improve as professionals.
  * We break down complex problems and consistently seek the most straightforward solutions.
  * We take quality and security seriously and factor it into everything we do.
  * We are comfortable with change in terms of priorities, goals and deadlines. We see this more as an opportunity than a hurdle. We are not satisfied with the status quo and push for change.
  * We seek those looking to make a severe impact and are excited about working in a high-growth startup.
  * We ship fast, continuously, and iteratively, learning with each step.
  * We are comfortable making mistakes. We don‚Äôt blame and consider every failure an opportunity to improve.
  * We measure everything, use the data to make decisions, and influence the organization 
  * We don‚Äôt allow blockers to prevent us from delivery. We step out of our comfort zone to find the solution and collaborate with other teams to move the initiatives forward

‚ÄúAs an engineer, I follow a product through its lifecycle, from ideation to delivery and support, which gives a lot of exposure to the technology and customer needs. This allows me to learn to improve both myself and the product constantly.‚Äù - Philip Beel, Engineering Manager.

**What you will do:**

  * Learn about how painful it is for large-scale companies to handle tax manually and understand how our technology is changing the status quo
  * Own what you build, with the ability to decide how to build it and the responsibility of operating it in the production environment.
  * Build meaningful products using modern technologies (REST, GRPC, Microservices, etc.) that our customers use and depend on for everyday business (finance, operation, tax and developer teams)
  * Record and collate Terabytes of data from all these operations for long-term storage and future insight
  * Continuously feed the learnings and observations of operating the system back into our products
  * Collaborate with the product team to define the future of our products and deliver value with every release

‚Äç **You would be a great fit if:**

  * You are fully proficient in English. Written and spoken, as we are a bunch from around the world, but we work in English.
  * You have a strong sense of ownership, care about what you build, and build the right thing that serves your customers.
  * You‚Äôre a builder at heart; you like the opportunity of having tons of exposure, making things work for a company long-term, and having an entrepreneurial attitude for anything that comes your way.
  * You are comfortable scaling and operating large-scale microservices in high-growth environments.
  * You are proficient in a couple of languages. Most of our current codebase is in Go and node.js with Typescript, but we are not married to any tools; we see them as a means to an end.
  * You like to keep your house tidy and clean, and you just can't leave code not covered with a test. Or a feature undelivered. Or dead code rotting in production.
  * You like to use data over opinions to make decisions. And are okay with finding the data yourself when it‚Äôs missing.
  * You value simplicity over complex solutions and always look for novel ways of simplifying the system. You build software without an ego but feel pride and joy seeing your work in production.
  * You prefer to improve the system as a whole and are not fixated on improving local optimums that may not impact the bottleneck.
