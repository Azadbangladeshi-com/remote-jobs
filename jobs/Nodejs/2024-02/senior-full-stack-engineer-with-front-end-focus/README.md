 **About BlueOcean**

Our first product is focused on completely changing the way brand tracking and measurement are performed, a mission-critical business process that has yet to be augmented or informed by software! The total US TAM is $74 Billion dollars, so it's a huge opportunity and just the first stop on this journey. In order to approach this problem, we have built our always-on brand tracking platform (Brand Navigator), a product that instantly informs brands about what to do today and tomorrow without waiting for an army of consultants or analyst groups to catch up. We already have great customers like SAP, Microsoft, and Bloomingdale's.

  

 **At BlueOcean, we have seven values that guide our mission and how we work together**

‚óè Get Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable.

‚óè We test, we learn, we release it

‚óè We embrace difference because diversity is our strength

‚óè We get comfortable with being uncomfortable because that‚Äôs how we grow

‚óè We achieve our goals when we build together

‚óè We celebrate wins and failures and hide nothing

‚óè We care about our customers, each other and our communities

‚óè We build trust when we do what we say

  

 **Equal Opportunity Employer:**

Blueocean.ai provides equal employment opportunity to all individuals regardless of their race, color, creed, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by state, federal, or local law.
