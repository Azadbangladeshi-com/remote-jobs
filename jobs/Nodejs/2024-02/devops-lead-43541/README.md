### Eco  
#### `ðŸ’° 65k-95k USD` `ðŸŒŽ Canada,United States`  

At Eco, our mission is to make peopleâ€™s money work for them â€” making it easier to hold, move and earn with your money, on your terms, than ever before. Our end vision challenges what people expect from money itself.

We believe crypto is simply a better way to hold and move money. We build products like Beam to make that a reality, and make it accessible to people. Beam is the fastest way to onboard into crypto and send money globally â€” from anywhere, to anyone, instantly, without limits. Killer features like autobridging, autorouting and Supersend (ask us!) push the boundary of what crypto enables and just how powerful the user experience can be.

Before building Beam, Eco was a major contributor to the launch of the Eco Currency. Now we remain active in its community, building future products and upgrades for the protocol. We continue to build one of the most selective teams in crypto, chasing one of its most ambitious visions.

Eco is on a mission to make your money work better for you. If youâ€™re interested in crypto, motivated by working on complex and important challenges that matter to everyone, and want to be part of a world-class team building market-leading products, we want to hear from you!
