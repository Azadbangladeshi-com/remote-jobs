 **What weâ€™re about**

At Job&Talent, we're revolutionising the employment market globally. Our mission is simple and clear. Weâ€™re empowering the people who do essential work - from delivery drivers and warehouse workers, to cooks and cleaners - to get work and get paid on their terms.

  

We match these people with companies weâ€™ve verified through our powerful tech platform. Apps, AI, web-based tools, innovative matching solutions and more. We create seriously smart technology, made for humans, by humans.

And the numbers show we're doing things right. 340,000 people got work with over 2,500 companies globally last year, with clients spanning industries from logistics to retail, hospitality and more. We generated â‚¬1.9 billion in revenue in 2022. And weâ€™re grateful to our top tier investors at Atomico, Kinnevik and Softbank.

  

We're headquartered in sunny Madrid, but we're a remote-first company operating in 10 countries across Europe, the United States and Latin America.

  

But thereâ€™s a missing piece. You.

  

 **Join our community**

If youâ€™re looking for a company that values innovation, high standards and data, youâ€™ve found it. Weâ€™re also good listeners, because everyoneâ€™s voice is heard at Job&Talent. These values help us make good decisions and keep momentum. Thatâ€™s how we operate. Standard.

  

When it comes to our people, weâ€™re all uniquely different. And itâ€™s that difference that makes us stronger.

  

We encourage everyone to bring their true selves to work. Being real and empathic means we can build better products, services and workplaces for our workers and our clients. And dare we say it, we think that makes us all happier humans.

  

 **Whatâ€™s in it for you**

We're building the worldâ€™s leading digital marketplace for essential work. Youâ€™ll hear 10x experience, AI, technology and human-centred design quite a lot. We strive for that across the entire company, from finance, to supply, to product.

  

 **Make an impact** through extreme ownership of the work you do. You create something and you help drive it forward. At Job&Talent, youâ€™ll make an impact across borders with cross-functional teams, wherever you are.

  

 **Be rewarded** financially. Itâ€™s ingrained into our company philosophy. We offer our employees competitive salaries and benefits. Our Talent team can tell you a lot more about the perks in your region.

  

 **Grow professionally** by doing, not just watching or talking. Weâ€™re completely hands-on and weâ€™re bootstrappers, making the most of our resources. And donâ€™t be surprised to find yourself on a call with one of our founders. They like the details as much as the big picture.

  

 **Proud to champion equality**

At Job&Talent we value diversity and we're an Equal Opportunities employer. We welcome applications from all suitably qualified people regardless of national origin, race, disability, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. Come join us. We look forward to your application.
