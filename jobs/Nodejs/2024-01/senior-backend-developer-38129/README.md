Join us at Commutifi, where weâ€™re building software to revolutionize commuting for a happier, more sustainable world. Enterprise businesses, universities, hospitals, commercial real estate entities, and the public sector use our platform to cut the time employees spend commuting, the carbon commutes emit, and the cost required to run commuting programs.  
  

We are seeking a highly motivated backend developer to join our team and contribute to the success of our mission. If you're a self-starter, eager to learn new technologies, and thrive on collaborative teamwork, we want to hear from you!  
  

Commutifi is a genuine remote-first company, with teams in across Canada and the US, including Montreal, QC and Boulder, CO. And when we say remote-first, we mean it: Whether you're hustling in the city or sitting on the beach, our virtual doors are wide open.  
  

Joining Commutifi means working under the leadership of veteran tech entrepreneurs. Your coworkers will include a CEO with multiple successful exits, a Director of Engineering with more than two decades of experience, and a CTO recently named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 social impact list. This depth of experience means weâ€™re not interested in the volatility of VC-funded startup life: Commutifi is a profitable company with long-term vision.  
  

Life is good at Commutifi, but donâ€™t take our word for itâ€”our employees have been here an average of 5 years, and weâ€™re proud of our near-perfect retention rate.
