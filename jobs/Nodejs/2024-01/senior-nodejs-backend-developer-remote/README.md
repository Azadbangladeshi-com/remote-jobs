We believe that (re)building better societies requires better fund distribution. That is why we created and are operating a software platform where organisations can build, own, control, operate and service their own fund distribution solutions. The platform allows users an efficient, transparent, and targeted distribution of their funds, preventing slippage and leakage.  
  
In this context, our SaaS management portal provides communities with an easy-to-use platform for managing stakeholders ranging from funders and merchants to spenders. This portal enables behavioural nudging, identity management, conditional earning, and targeted spending, among many other features.
