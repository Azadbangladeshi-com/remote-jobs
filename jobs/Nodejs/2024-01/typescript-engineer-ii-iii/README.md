**About Last Call Media**

Last Call Media is a 10+ year old company that started in Massachusetts, USA, and we‚Äôve been fully remote since 2017.

**How We Work**

We like to do work with purpose; a lot of our clients are higher ed, non-profit and charities, and government contracts with state/city departments.

Last Call Media has a nontraditional company structure; we have no ‚Äúpeople managers‚Äù and the individuals that do really well here are self-starters who can work independently, but know when to ask for help.

We‚Äôre a highly collaborative environment. From the projects we work on to the way our company is run, we believe that the more perspectives we‚Äôre able to take into account, the better things will be. We like to maintain alignment by checking in early and often and communicating frequently. We like to avoid people completing large deliverables in a vacuum, where misalignments can grow large.

Because of our nontraditional company structure, our highly collaborative environment, and our frequent check-ins, we approach accountability a little differently than many other organizations by having a high level of trust with everyone. Our work is the product of our collaboration--if improvements need to be made, we approach them as a team as opposed to placing blame on individuals.

Last Call encourages people to maintain a good work/life balance. People do not work on weekends, and we do not interrogate people who want to take time off. We do ask that all employees schedule their work days to have at least a five hour overlap with 9:00 am - 5:00 pm eastern time (EDT/EST), but how that ends up working out is different for everyone. What matters most is that your team can count on you to attend meetings and meet project deadlines. **Please note that the client for this role requires candidates to be located within the contiguous 48 United States, and work 9-5 Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.**

We heavily utilize Slack and Jira for frequent daily communication. Other tools in our belt include Google Apps (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.), Confluence, Harvest, and more that are specific to specialized teams. Teams at LCM are based around a specific project, and will have their own meeting cadences (daily standup, retros, etc.) as well. Almost everyone at Last Call is a member of one or more teams, and we come together as a company (virtually) regularly.

All of us at LCM pride ourselves on being:

  * Able to empathize, which helps us understand the needs of the client, the customer, the product, and the team at LCM 
  * Highly communicative
  * Able to work independently
  * Comfortable asking for help
  * Experienced with communicating with clients directly
  * Eager and motivated to learn new concepts
  * Team players in a collaborative environment
  * Fast learners  
  

**Compensation & How To Apply: **

This position is compensated at a salary commensurate with skill and experience, with an anticipated range of $90,000 - $120,000 USD annually. LCM also offers a comprehensive benefits package including an annual (unlimited) professional development budget; a flexible PTO policy; health, dental, and vision insurance; and more!

If this position already sounds like you or where you're headed, please apply. Applications must be completed in English. AI use is welcomed, with the expectation that you understand and can explain your responses.  
  

**Our hiring process has five steps:**

  1. First, you‚Äôll complete the application, which includes a questionnaire about your skills and experience - we do not ask for cover letters.
  2. If selected, you‚Äôll perform a brief code review that will take no more than 20 minutes.
  3. If selected, you‚Äôll be interviewed by members of our team.
  4. If selected, you‚Äôll complete a more in-depth skills assessment that will take no more than 2 hours.
  5. If selected, you‚Äôll be invited to discuss your solution with members of LCM‚Äôs Government Solutions Group.
