## About the role

As a Senior Backend Engineer for Automations, you will take ownership of one domain of our software, build new features for our customers and sometimes even for other teams.

You will leverage your skills to design and implement services that improve our level of automation and integration, develop and maintain our data pipeline, enabling users to use their data with integrations of major third-party platforms like Facebook, Google, and Zapier. In addition, you will enhance the integration part of our app, which is all about integrating our app into our users' existing workflows, connecting Funnels to apps like CRMs, analytics tools, and others to transfer and share data, help users process and nurture leads, and collaborate throughout the app. You will also exchange knowledge and learnings with other developers, and collaborate closely with your peers while still being autonomous and remote. Finally, you will leverage the feedback from customers to build features that align closely with their needs.

## What you will be doing

  * Develop new features and improve existing ones in an iterative way so that they¬¥re reliable, secure, scalable, well-tested, cost efficient and performant. And we know, it always sounds easier than it might be but this is part of our job. We have to make the right tradeoffs, prioritize properly and focus on impact. You know how it is. #lessbutbetter
  * end2end ownership following the you-build-it-you-run-it principle: You¬¥re part of the full lifecycle of our products, i.e. from discovery through implementation, releasing to operating, observing and maintaining them. No one throws code over the fence of another team. From our experience, full ownership is key. #fullownership
  * Work remotely and collaborate in cross-functional teams with a high level of autonomy. 
    * This does not only mean you¬¥re a great team player with strong communication skills, it also means: 
      * you work very well with all the peers and stakeholders in the team and are not afraid of giving and receiving feedback. Feedback is a wonderful gift, the essence to a great remote culture and the core of our growth and success. #succeedwithjoy #becordial #keepgrowing
      * we all are delivery managers. As such, we create transparency about the progress of our work and take care of releasing our artifacts. And sometimes we even craft some nice instructions for our colleagues in customer support to make their and our customers¬¥ lives easier. #customerobsession #succeedwithjoy
      * you care about what we build and participate proactively in ideations, roadmap plannings, discoveries and other team meetings. #fullownership #customerobsession
      * the code you write is great to work with for current and future peers (e.g. by writing clean code, following best practices, principles and patterns, writing tests, documenting important decisions, ‚Ä¶) #keepgrowing
  * Solve what matters: we don¬¥t want you to be an engineer that just finds a solution for a problem but a product engineer that solves the issues of our customers and builds products they love. We want you to be proud of your work. Not because of overengineering but because our customers love what we build. And how would you know that? Because you¬¥re a data-driven engineer tracking the KPIs you created to measure our success. Think like an entrepreneur. #customerobsession #thinkdesign #lessbutbetter

## Who you are

  * You are intrinsically motivated for owning and driving core backend parts of a SaaS product
  * You have a strong problem solving mindset with the customers in mind
  * You have a strong entrepreneurial mindset, we do not want to micromanage people, we want to empower them and know they know what¬¥s best for our customers to drive initiatives end to end
  * You are fluent in English both written and verbal (knowledge of the German language is a plus)
  * You have 6 or more years of experience as an Engineer. We could say ‚ÄúBackend Engineer‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlatform Engineer‚Äù, but in the end, we want you to be set up for success in your role
  * You are capable to program in Node.js and Typescript, if you have experience with CDK, nice!
  * You have experience in architecting and implementing an API and running it in production
  * You know your basics as an engineer, best practices, principles, patterns, you name it
  * You have a good understanding of challenges and common approaches in distributed systems
  * You have already worked with a NoSQL database in a professional production environment
  * You don¬¥t take yourself too seriously, we don¬¥t either ;)

If you think this job is the right job for you, even though you do not perfectly match the profile, we would still love to hear from you. ü§ó
