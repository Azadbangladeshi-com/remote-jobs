###  **Job Description**

Bitkey sits within the Proto team. Proto's purpose is to accelerate the worldâ€™s transition to a more open economy by making products that increase access and independence for everyone. The first two initiatives weâ€™ve identified that represent the biggest impact to this purpose are in the Bitcoin space with Bitcoin mining and Bitkey, a self custody Bitcoin wallet. While weâ€™re starting there, we donâ€™t believe the need for tools to increase oneâ€™s independence is limited to bitcoin or the financial space. One principle across everything we do in Proto is open development â€“ show and tell. We develop products in the open, you can read more about them at bitkey.build and mining.build.
