# [Account Executive](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/account-executive-83165)  
### Anima  
#### `üåé United Kingdom`  

Do you wish your work had greater tangible impact? üåü  
  
At Anima, we're building the next generation care enablement platform for healthcare teams. You'll be building a product that saves lives; multiple Clinical Engineers (ex-MDs and fullstack Software Engineers) quit lucrative medicine jobs to join Anima for that very reason!

 **Our mission is to deliver precision medicine to everyone in the world, within 24 hours. We know** _ **exactly**_ **how to get there and we‚Äôre moving ferociously with focus.**

Our ambition is to be the OS for all of healthcare and life sciences, through a proprietary active learning, crowdsourcing training architecture - we call it Anima 2.0. We already have one of the biggest, highest quality labelled datasets in the world.

 **We're profitable, growing at 100% MoM, and went from $0 ARR to $1m ARR in 6 months from launch (Apr '22)**. **We‚Äôre on track to hit $10m ARR by H2 ‚Äò24.** That's pretty unprecedented in SaaS, never mind healthcare!

###  **Backed by a top 1% VC and Y Combinator (home of epic companies like Airbnb, Coinbase, Stripe)** üöÄ

We were one of the hottest companies of YC‚Äôs W21 batch: we raised over $2.5m before Demo Day within 4 days, led by Hummingbird (consistently top 1% of global returns), giving us a runway of 4+ years. **We have now closed an over subscribed Series A round.**

 ****We have a pretty unique hacker culture at Anima** with a flat hierarchy: almost everyone is technical and can code **. A 'knights of the round table' structure and thinking from first principles is core to our culture,** and is how we've made such rapid progress**. It's reflected in how we operate:

  1. There's no separate founder, product & engineering teams - instead, we have Clinical Engineers who are both their own customers (MDs) and are strong fullstack engs, collaborating with pure software engineers. Due to the quality of our team, there's a heavy focus on coaching and teaching, with minimal to no line management.

    * We've been able to make huge strides in the NHS because we all deeply understand the problem, grading tasks based on our engineering expertise, and real life clinical trade-offs. This deep domain knowledge is ultimately how we integrated with the major electronic health records (EMIS and SystmOne) in just 4 months.

  2. We're relentlessly resourceful - in 14 months, we've built an extremely loved enterprise app (NPS = 87) that users have said 'seems too good to be true'. Anima can take an information complete medical history as good or better than a typical human doctor, and automates patient comms and clinical notes.

  3. Anima is a safe haven for free thinkers and we've been careful to build a culture where everyone feels comfortable being their complete unfiltered self, sharing their honest thoughts, feelings without ever needing to self-censor. Our hiring acceptance rate is around 0.5-0.8%, which is lower than YC. You're joining hyper elite special forces, and your crewmates will never let you down or waste your time.

  4. We hire talented people who think from first principles and have high growth potential - great decision makers who deserve to have complete autonomy and are forces of nature when empowered with it. Decisions are never made in isolation by the founders. All information is transparently available to the whole team on our Notion - every meeting, decision, success, failure.

  5. At the same time, we are deeply collaborative, and through mutual and self-challenge, we converge towards the optimum, and decisively execute. We are united by child-like intellectual curiosity and experiment and wander freely when the right path isn‚Äôt clear. We believe all future managers should be formidable individual contributors & domain experts.

  6. We hire candidates from all over the world. We have remote hubs in **EU West, NA and India,** and plans to seed some in person teams in those areas too in the next 12 months (in addition to our fully remote teams). We offer flexibility over work schedule and location.

  7. We have a good time :) we've had team lunches in Duck & Waffle, Breakfast Club, dumplings in Chinatown, had private screenings in our own cinema, booked out the Sky Pool etc. We get the whole team together at least twice a year for team retreats, with the last ones in Brittany, France and Mexico!

###  **Join Anima and save lives** üåü

 **Hi - My name is Shun, a medical doctor and CEO of Anima. Thanks for checking out our job ad**! We‚Äôre tackling a problem that has affected everyone in some way:

  * Globally, millions die every year because their medical problems aren‚Äôt treated quickly enough. Hundreds of millions suffer pain, worry and discomfort needlessly because of long waiting times.

  * We‚Äôve built ambitious software to automate the entire healthcare workflow - from history taking consultations, to report abstraction, to recommending & saving a coded action plan for the patient, ready for a human doctor to greenlight.

  * By doing this, we get patients optimal care within 24 hours and 10x the clinical workflow in the process. It's a win-win for patients and healthcare professionals.

We are pretty unique among health techs: we have _both_ medical and engineering domain expertise - there are 4 doctors working full time at Anima, as well as 'pure' software engineers. I wrote the first backend in Node, 80% of which is still used. As a doctor and former HM Treasury health policy advisor managing ¬£4bn budgets in UK health spending, I have full stack domain knowledge and personal experience of the problem we‚Äôre solving.

 **Like me, the whole Anima team have personal experience of the problem we're solving: we're building what we wished we had as doctors.**

### Do you want to save lives with every clinic that you onboard?

_Please note that as this role may involve site work and on-site support for our users, we can only consider your application if you are based in the UK. You will not be able to complete our screening task if you are not based in the UK, so please bear this in mind when submitting your application. We hope to welcome you to the team soon!_

Join Anima, and you'll use your influence and people skills to get Anima into clinics and entire regions: an urgently needed product that saves lives amid critical levels of patient demand, with healthcare systems in crisis across the globe.

Since launching in the UK a year ago, we're now used in by GP practices, primary care networks and federations across the country who collectively provide care for over 500,000 patients. We‚Äôve been growing more than 100% MoM in terms of users and revenue, and recently it‚Äôs been more like 2-3x MoM! We‚Äôre profitable, and on track to hit $10m ARR by H2 ‚Äò24, from $0 in Apr ‚Äò22.

### Have amazing stakeholder conversations with users who fanatically love the product, and steer our product direction

Our current distribution team have said that one of the biggest perks of working at Anima is seeing the delight and disbelief on people‚Äôs faces when we show them our demo, something that is truly a 10x generational leap. Here‚Äôs what some of our users have been saying:

*‚ÄúI sent a plan to the patient and it‚Äôs incredible, within a few minutes they‚Äôre coming back to me saying that they can make the appointment!‚Äù

"I would call that next generation, I think you have that badge"

‚ÄùSometimes you need to stop driving a Fiesta and buy a Mercedes"*

Lots of us went into medicine because we wanted to maximise our positive impact. At Anima, we understand that distribution is the other half of a legendary product. Here are incredible things we‚Äôve built as a result of our fullstack sales team:

  * A Clinical Director at one of our practices wanted to streamline multiple access channels and make access equitable and fair. After some great discovery and deep listening, the AM together with the customer suggested we build something called ‚Äòproxy requests‚Äô, which would allow the reception team at a clinic to complete Anima requests on behalf of a patient who was on a landline call - this made it possible to give someone with no internet or mobile phone the same access to care. This is now one of our most popular features that has led to viral referrals and fanatical users.

  * Bronagh, a fullstack account manager, realised that adding a configurable feature that allows patients to self-book appointments directly into the electronic health record calendar would be critical to closing large enterprise accounts. By deeply understanding the pain points and anxieties underlying the feature, Anima built the feature in 9 days, to the great excitement of users at demo calls and $1m+ ACV meetings.

  * Off the back of fanatical referrals from our existing users, the team was invited to present to NHS England at national and regional level, and we‚Äôve been helping to shape the future of the primary care market through an upcoming $1bn+ procurement framework.

###  **Does this sound like you?**

  * Hungry and wants their shot to change the world - a force of nature when empowered with the tools, resources and development to do it.

  * Exceptional communicator, able to distill complex information into clear and concise bullets without jargon. An excellent conduit between users and the rest of the company.

  * Able to execute a high sigma discovery process and in combination with incisive people intuition, elucidate deep pain points and opportunities to excite within minutes of the first call.

  * Has incredibly high standards for themselves and an unshakeable growth mindset: able to challenge themselves and those around them to push to do things better.

  * Exceptionally organised: able to build & maintain multiple relationships across a diverse range of organisations, and consistently execute on plans to onboard and retain users. Reliably follows up on 100% of qualified leads at optimal intervals.

  * A gifted relationship builder, able to quickly build rapport and emotional anchors with almost anyone and any persona.

  * Pragmatic rather than dogmatic in decision making: able to weigh real world data appropriately, changing course when necessary towards optimal outcomes for patients and clinicians.

  * Keen to understand the big picture & entire context of the company and vertical; impatient to grow towards a senior executive role.

  * Seeks to maximise combined team productivity, communicating the right things at the right time through the right channels.

  * Intellectually curious and loves learning - able to tackle entirely novel challenges that lack prior precedent through first principles thinking, creatively using the right pragmatic approach, with an understanding of alternatives and trade offs.

 **It's helpful to have B2B/SaaS experience, generating leads of $30-50k+ ACV, but not mandatory - we will make exceptions if you‚Äôre a high performing BDR. You need to have demonstrated a high growth mindset and potential for rapid skill development through past projects. For this role, you will need to be based in the UK.**

###  **Our current users & what to expect from the role**

We're live with GP teams across the country, being used by teams across the NHS. Over the rest of 2023, we're continuing to onboard teams that want to build the future of healthcare, and will be working with the NHS to deploy Anima at regional & national level. We‚Äôll also be identifying international partners to power Anima‚Äôs next stage of growth.

Here‚Äôs some information on our technical stack in case you are interested (this may not make much sense to you - that's okay!): we are tech agonistic, and collectively choose the best tools for the job. We‚Äôre constantly looking to maximise our productivity and minimise what we call ‚Äúdiscounted dev time cost‚Äù for shipping features. We have 2 separate fully functional web apps in prod: one for clinical users and one for patients. We have good functional & unit test coverage and we recently implemented an advanced CI/CD pipeline which supports golden screenshots and automated frontend tests.

We‚Äôre looking to add talented account managers who are hungry and understand the urgency and importance of what we‚Äôre doing for society.

### First month - some examples of what to expect:

  * Participate in user discovery & demo calls to develop a deep understanding of their fundamental motivations and needs/pain points, translating these insights into optimal feature roadmaps.

  * Source leads and execute campaigns. Get as much exposure as possible to developing the full lifecycle of an opportunity from lead through to closure.

  * Join the team at events & conferences, speaking to potential users, conducting demos and converting leads.

### Next 6 months - some examples of what to expect:

  * Build domain expertise to scale our prospecting, identifying the teams in the most pain who are likely to become fanatical users of Anima.

  * Become the central point of contact for assigned GP practices and PCNs. Your job is to maximise discounted fanaticism, doing whatever is necessary to help practices start - and continue - using Anima.

  * Work with customer success colleagues to maximise virality and fanaticism across your accounts, doing whatever is needed to ensure every account leads to the maximum number of fanatical referrals.

### 6+ months - some examples of what to expect:

  * Potential to transition into a Strategic Enterprise AE, with managerial responsibility for junior AEs joining the team.

  * Take on account management responsibility for larger accounts e.g. GP federations and ICSs (covering 1m+ patients).

  * Work with the team to scale our sales & marketing, including working with NHS leaders to identify and secure regional & national-level procurement opportunities, including those beyond primary care.

  * This is a permanent role: things get even more exciting down the line!
