  * Architect and implement NoSQL database clusters with a focus on redundancy, resiliency, backup/recovery, observability, and cost optimization.

  * Automate the deployment of NoSQL databases to both physical datacenter hardware and cloud environments, including AWS and within Kubernetes infrastructure.

  * Construct end-to-end workflows leveraging AWS resources like EC2, EBS, Step Functions, S3, and others as necessary.

  * Maintain, troubleshoot, and scale NoSQL databases throughout product lifecycles, adapting deployments based on evolving data volume and throughput needs.

  * Respond to critical NoSQL database incidents such as node failures, loss of network connectivity, or storage issues.

  * Liaise with NoSQL database vendors for best practices, patches, and performance enhancements.

  * Analyze and optimize costs associated with NoSQL database deployments over time.

  * Participate in on-call rotations for critical support issues.

 **Minimum Requirements:**

  * Proven experience with NoSQL database technologies (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Dremio, Zookeeper, MongoDB, Neo4J, Weaviate, etc.) in both clustered and non-clustered environments.

  * Strong experience with infrastructure automation using Ansible, Terraform, and Python.

 **Critical Skills:**

  * Proficiency in deploying and managing NoSQL databases in both datacenter and cloud environments, primarily AWS.

  * Experience working with Kubernetes, and knowledge of clustered-NoSQL database (eg. Dremio, Weaviate, etcâ€¦) deployments within Kubernetes would be a significant asset.

  * Ability to build and maintain AWS resource workflows.

 **Additional Skills:**

  * Strong understanding of system monitoring, performance tuning, and cost optimization techniques.

  * Excellent collaborative skills to work with cross-functional teams and stakeholders.

  * Problem-solving mindset with a proactive approach to addressing challenges.

If you are a results-driven software engineer passionate about NoSQL database technologies + cloud infrastructure and are seeking an opportunity to make a tangible impact within a dynamic organization, please submit your resume and cover letter for consideration.
