### Employment Hero  
#### `üåé United Kingdom`  

### Our mission and where you fit in

At Employment Hero, we‚Äôre an ambitious bunch on a mission to make employment easier and more valuable for everyone.

Since our inception in 2014 we've had some pretty impressive growth (100% YoY), now serving 300,000 businesses globally, with 2 million+ users on the platform, reaching unicorn status in 2022 - and we have no plans to slow down.

There‚Äôs never been a more exciting time to join one of the fastest-growing SaaS unicorns, so let‚Äôs see if we could be a match!

### What your days might look like

This role is with our HR, Benefits and Payroll Integration teams who build and run an all-in-one platform so our customers can manage everything from pay and annual leave to professional development and employee engagement.

We think support engineering is just as important as feature development and it's crucial to our revenue. As the first Senior Engineer in our newly created UK Support team, you'll have instant impact for customers as you investigate and fix urgent technical issues.

### Week to week you'll be:

  * Working across our Ruby, Typescript, React and Node.js codebases which are run in an AWS cloud environment using EC2 and Kubernetes
  * Navigating different parts of a complex SAAS product - picking up new tools, technologies and subject domains quickly
  * Working with UK Product Owners to triage and then delegate and resolve P1 and P2 tickets
  * Working smart: building tools and automations which help customers fix issues themselves
  * Building strong, collaborative relationships with engineering colleagues in Vietnam
  * Being the go-to-person for the UK support engineering team which includes an intermediate and junior engineer 

You'll accelerate your career quickly, working with talented people in a fully remote and flexible environment. We encourage our teams to embrace new technology, actively leveraging Github Copilot and other generative AI.

### What will you bring

### We're looking for someone who:

  * Has solid experience with at least one of Ruby on Rails, React, Node.js or Typescript and is keen to pick up new languages and frameworks
  * Finds it rewarding to investigate and solve issues for customers
  * Is a strong communicator who can work with + learn from teams across different time zones
  * Is happy solving problems under pressure and knows when to escalate issues
  * Can effectively manage their own time as well as prioritising and delegating work for a team
  * Would like to mentor and build capacity in mid-level / junior engineers

Experience is important, but for us the biggest measure of success is people who can live and breathe our values. Show us what you can bring to the table, and we‚Äôll empower you to let your talents shine.

### Life at Employment Hero

We also recognise the value of face-to-face connection, and organise local and global gatherings throughout the year to celebrate our wins and make meaningful connections with our colleagues.

But don‚Äôt just take it from us, here‚Äôs a quote from one of our UK heroes:

_‚ÄúA couple of years ago I couldn‚Äôt have even imagined that I would be sitting here in my apartment in London, doing my dream job with a team on the other side of the world. But what I really didn‚Äôt expect is how safe and supported I feel in my role, and that so much trust and such a friendly working environment has been built quickly and virtually.‚Äù_
