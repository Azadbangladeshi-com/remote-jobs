Substackâ€™s mission is to build a new economic engine for culture. As a member of Substackâ€™s Growth team, you will be responsible for building mobile features that bring writers and creators to Substack and help them succeed here â€“ improving discovery, activating new users, strengthening Substackâ€™s network, and running A/B tests on key user flows. Engineers on Growth work in close partnership with designers, product thinkers, and customers to make it easier than ever for writers and creators to make a living.

Substackâ€™s compensation package includes a market-competitive salary, equity for all full-time roles, and exceptional benefits. Our cash compensation salary range for this role is $165,000 - $210,000. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.

###  **Responsibilities**

  * Develop features that help grow the Substack app and ecosystem.
  * On Android, we use Kotlin and all the latest Google-approved technologies (i.e. Jetpack Compose, Room, Coroutines, etc.). On the web, work with JavaScript, especially Node/Express and React, and Postgres. Itâ€™s helpful if you know these technologies already, if not, weâ€™ll be excited to help you learn. 
  * Collaborate with other Android engineers at Substack to define architectural patterns and ship new features for the Android client.
  * Collaborate with designers, writers, support staff, and many others. From product concept and research to implementation and deployment, we expect you to own your work and operate autonomously.
  * Work directly with customers to solve their problems.

### Requirements

  * At least 8 years of software engineering experience.
  * Experience shipping high quality Android apps.
  * Independent and autonomous. Weâ€™re too small to micromanage, and expect that every person at the company owns their work and can be a leader.
  * Hold yourself and others to a high standard when working on production systems.
  * Take pride in building elegant and delightful product experiences. Substack works best when it gets out of the way so writers can focus on writing and connecting with their readers. 
  * Enjoy collaboration with a diverse group of thinkers while bringing our own unique experience and background to the team.
  * Believe in Substackâ€™s mission to build a new economic engine for culture.

Experience at a fast-growing startup or working on a high-performing growth team is not required, but is a plus.
