### Octopus Energy  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

The energy industry is undergoing the largest transformation since industrialisation at an unprecedented rate of change and we are positioning ourselves to be at the heart of that change.

Our aim is to be the leading global provider of solutions that enable customers to release Â£30bn of value per annum from distributed energy resources (DERs). We are building a Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription business with a global addressable market of Â£2.4 billion per annum, by digitally connecting hundreds of thousands of DERs with energy markets.

We have already attained a market leading position and KrakenFlex is a recognised thought leader and innovator in the industry. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed and we are pleased to announce that we now have the full support and backing of Octopus Energy, an award-winning UK energy supplier who share our passion and values.

Sennen has recently combined forces with KrakenFlex! Our vision is to transform infrastructure through technology together, for a more sustainable world. Our mission is to become the go-to technology provider for renewable energy operators who are serious about safety, automation and efficiency at scale.

Our technology has two primary functions. For offshore wind farm operators, our sophisticated modular solution is designed to manage marine coordination, work management and health and safety control through a single integrated platform. For asset owners and funders, our software enables asset managers to streamline reporting, improve data quality and manage risk and compliance.

As a company, we seek to collaborate, deliver and grow. We listen to our customers and each other in order to offer support and share our expertise. We have trust and confidence in our team and let our creativity flourish. We donâ€™t have all the answers and are always learning. Underpinning everything we do is a commitment to help deliver the energy transition to combat climate change and limit environmental destruction.

### What you'll do

  * Creating intuitive and powerful new modules and functionality that will serve operators of renewable energy projects. The front end is handled through Sennenâ€™s own dashboard framework linking these through to the database structures. 
  * You will work in a small team of developers with plenty of opportunities for collaboration and skill development.

### What you'll need

  * Solid experience in JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript 
  * Experience writing HTTP/JSON APIs and Node.js/Express services
  * Familiarity with SQL/databases desirable but not essential
  * Passion for creating innovative software using high quality, well architected and clean code.
  * Ability to write concise, robust and readable code
  * Good coding practices including testing and peer code reviews
  * Interest in creating clean looking user interfaces
  * A collaborative approach, comfortable working with users and stakeholders with diverse perspectives and needs
  * You may also bring - or like to gain - skills in functional programming in JavaScript
  * Exposure to agile working practices. 
  * You have an interest in renewable energy, offshore wind and other infrastructure on which our society depends

### Why else you'll love it here

  *  **Wondering what the salary for this role is?** Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
  * Octopus Energy is a **unique culture**. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we were voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people 
  * Visit our perks hub - Octopus Employee Benefits

Ideally you will be based in the Greater Manchester and happy to come into the office a couple of days per week! But we appreciate that things have changed and flexibility is at the top of everyone's agenda, so if you would rather be remote please let us know.

**If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.**

 _Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, an inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone._
