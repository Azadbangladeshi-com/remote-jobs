Description

You enjoy writing code, but in the back of your mind youâ€™re always wondering: what problem does this solve? Who will be using this software and how will this make their work easier? You are fascinated by how your software is used and how it can be improved. You like to dive into the end usersâ€™ workflows to make them as seamless as possible. Because itâ€™s not just about the code, itâ€™s about the results.

Youâ€™ve found that having a robust, automated test suite frees the team to take on refactoring efforts with confidence, knowing that the system youâ€™ve built wonâ€™t let you deploy broken software even if you try. You believe that collaborating with others makes it so that everyone learns, you build a better product, and you can sleep at night and go on vacation with the assurance that what youâ€™ve constructed is stable.

The Device Detections and Tasking team is responsible for pulling data from our customersâ€™ environments and running automated detections on that data as quickly as possible, because every second counts during a security incident. We're building a next-generation data ingestion and detection pipeline that empowers our detection and response engineers to focus on what they love about security.

To accomplish these goals we need help building out our data pipeline and user interface, which will allow our users to describe detection logic. Proficiency with React is strongly preferred, along with an eagerness to learn more about data-intensive systems (in Go). If this sounds like you, then we believe you'll love our team, and weâ€™d love to talk to you!
