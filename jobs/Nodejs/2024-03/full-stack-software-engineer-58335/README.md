  * Develop efficient and reusable components and utilities to drive web and mobile application development.
  * Create software features that are robust, reliable, and user-friendly for both internal teams and our customer base.
  * Execute the full software development life-cycle, including problem definition, design, development, testing, demoing, and supporting production use of the features you own.

### We Might be a Good Fit If

  * You have experienced developing best-in-class mobile and web apps, as well as monitoring and supporting them in production.
  * Being close to customers (speaking to them, if needed) and leading projects to make their lives better sounds exciting.
  * You like to go deep on technical problems in a low-structure, high-ownership environment, but still come up for air often to communicate progress to your team.

### **Perks of Working with Us**

  * Do meaningful work in healthcare for customers who could really use your help.
  * Work on a product with strong product-market fit and a backlog of validated customer problems. If you build it, they will use it.
  * Enjoy fully remote work with zero commutes. There is no “back-to-office” because we were remote from day 1.
  * Being globally remote means we know how to work asynchronously. We work hard, but we also enjoy a flexible personal schedule and unlimited paid time off.

### Our Interview Process

The interview process is designed to simulate the type of work that engineers typically perform on a daily basis. We do not ask deceptive questions, delve into obscure topics, or present academic conundrums. You do not need to dust off your algorithm textbook or grind Leetcode problems to pass our interviews. **We are hiring engineers across the stack, so wherever your expertise lies, we’ll tailor your interview questions to match your strengths.**

The interview process consists of the following steps. The order may vary depending on your availability:

  * Woven Asynchronous Assessment
  * Technical Screening
    * Code interview (~1 hour)
  * Technical Deep-Dive
    * Two code interviews (~1 hour each)
    * System design interview (~1 hour)
  * Hiring manager interview (~1 hour)

You will receive information about the interview formats and what to expect beforehand, including preparation tips and sample problems.
