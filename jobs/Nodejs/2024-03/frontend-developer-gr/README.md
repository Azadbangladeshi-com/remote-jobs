### Job Description

Our micro-frontend portal framework (internal project name ‚ÄúJukebox‚Äù) adds dynamic configuration of micro frontends on top of Luigi. This enables large-scale distribution and loosely coupled development of UIs into single frontend application. While in most Luigi-based applications, the configuration is hard-coded, Jukebox determines the configuration (i.e. the navigation entries including the links to the micro-frontends) during runtime. This is achieved by reading the configuration data from a persistence provided within a Kubernetes cluster. Jukebox consists of a server application implemented using the NestJS framework and a frontend application implemented as Angular application using the Luigi framework.
