 **About the Team**

The key focus of the Intelligent Automation team is to maximize Workdayâ€™s automation investments by creating platforms and services that enable engineers the ability to compose, execute, schedule, and track highly repetitive automation and orchestration tasks through a consistent, intuitive, and scalable self-service framework. We provide cost optimization by improving operational efficiency and business agility through automation as well as risk mitigation by converting error prone human driven manual tasks into data, event, or response initiated repeatable automation as code at scale.

 **About the Role**

As a member of the Intelligent Automation team, you will assist and lead in the research, development, build, and support of scale remote procedure call, automation, orchestration, and heuristics-based DevOps/AIOps solutions across a wide swath of Workdayâ€™s technical areas. Our IA team has built several critical tools that support Workdayâ€™s SaaS properties, its engineers, and its management. Our products and tools typically go from a need based conceptual discussion with our stakeholders to production deployment. We follow agile methodologies. We look to amplify or reuse our existing frameworks where possible but are always developing and evaluating new technology to meet our customerâ€™s needs.

 **About You**

You will provide strategic operations support, oversee all agile processes, and advocate for scalable architecture and processes across all development teams, further strengthening our technical capabilities and enhancing organizational efficiency.

You fully understand that technology suites and tooling shift rapidly in industry but that, largely, the core fundamentals of computing do not. What we are looking for is someone that enjoys computer science, solving hard technical problems, and is willing to accept and give help where there are gaps. We donâ€™t expect that any individual will have all answers to all things and so the ability to interact and work with the full team highly critical to a team memberâ€™s and teamâ€™s success.

  * Bachelors in computer science, Electrical Engineering, or equivalent or an MS in Computer Science will be an acceptable equivalent if technical experience is less than 10 years.
  * Full understanding and ability to construct a complete cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) infrastructure composed of compute, storage (object/block), network, database, interfacing services, security rules, containers, and container management technology (CNCF).
  * Highly proficient in at least one of the following functional languages: Ruby, Go, C, Java, or Python
  * Ability to work with design and tune a modern relational database with a strong preference toward Oracle database technologies.
  * Ability to code proficiently in at least one scripting language such as Bash.
  * Proven experience coding and completing POC development using frameworks such as APEX, Node, Sinatra, WLS, tomcat. 

**Other Qualifications**

  * Ability to interview and build relationships with our engineering and management customers to satisfy their needs and deliver functional software in a timely manner.
  * Familiarity with how to work and interact within an Agile team.
  * Experience and proven background in Streaming technologies including but not limited to Kafka Streams, RMQ, NATS Streaming etc.

 **Our Approach to Flexible Work**  

With Flex Work, weâ€™re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote "home office" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Pursuant to applicable Fair Chance law, Workday will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

Workday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.
