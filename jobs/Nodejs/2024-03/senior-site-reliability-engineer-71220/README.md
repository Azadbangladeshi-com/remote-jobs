# ****About MoonPay 🌖💸****

Hi, we’re MoonPay. We’re here to onboard the world to Web3.

Why? Because we think Web3 is a unique and democratizing technology. It gives people back control of their money, digital identity, data, and property like nothing else before it.  
  
 ** **What we do****

We’re the leading infrastructure company in Web3. This means we offer our partners everything from payment solutions (we call them 'Ramps') to minting software for digital collectibles, like NFTs. And over 16 million people around the world now trust our products — just take a look on Trustpilot.

We’re also big on collaborations. And we've worked on stunts, drops, and partnerships with some of the world's most prestigious and forward-thinking brands.

But that’s not all. At the start of 2023, we launched our own consumer app because we wanted to see if we could build a better Web3 account. It’s taken off in a big way, so we’re working to hone it further.

So whatever your background, we’re sure there’s something for you here. Come help us build the future of Web3 and digital ownership.

 **About the Opportunity ✍️**  
Site Reliability Engineering at MoonPay is responsible for providing a resilient, secure, production-ready platform that enables MoonPay to safely deploy applications and services in a self-serve, repeatable manner.

  * Own the deployment pipelines and continuously improve our monitoring and alerting capabilities.

  * Collaborate closely with all other engineering functions to provide timely feedback from our environments.

  * Support Engineering on their journey to deliver better software, faster and more safely (think “It’s OK to deploy on Fridays” 😎).
