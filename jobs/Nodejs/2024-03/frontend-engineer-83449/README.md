**💬 Why this role now?  
**  

Our product team is ~10 Engineers, 3 QAs, 2 designers (Valentin, Russ), 1 PM, Engineering Manager and our founders (Pulkit & Brian). We are building the best product in our category and are shipping great functionality, (see this or our LinkedIn page) but we want to go even faster 🚀 . We currently work in two pods: Better (core product) and Bets (growth/new).

  
We raised a Series A last year after years of bootstrapped and sustainable growth, so are in a financially strong position. We have never conducted layoffs and believe in thoughtful hiring through forecasting.

  
We are looking for a **Frontend Engineer** who excels in a fast pace remote environment, is enthusiastic about building excellent software, and enjoys tackling a diverse range of problems.
