💬 Why this role now?  
**  

Our product team is ~10 Engineers, 3 QAs, 2 designers (Valentin, Russ), 1 PM, Engineering Manager and our founders (Pulkit & Brian). We are building the best product in our category and are shipping great functionality, (see this or our LinkedIn page) but we want to go even faster. 🚀 We currently work in two pods: Better (core product) and Bets (growth/new).  
  

We raised a Series A last year after years of bootstrapped and sustainable growth, so are in a financially strong position. We have never conducted reduction in workforce layoffs and believe in thoughtful hiring through forecasting.  
  

We are seeking a **Fullstack Engineer** who thrives in a startup environment, has a passion for creating outstanding software, and enjoys solving a wide variety of problems. The **Fullstack** part of this Role is in connecting the dots from our backend to either the customer-facing or the end-user facing JavaScript clients.

  * Create customer-facing and internal APIs (MongoDB, Heroku, AWS)
  * Build and maintain data import pipelines and analyze data to make better predictions
  * Work on your Sprint backlog; highlight your questions, document your progress (Trello)
  * Review pull requests of other engineers (Github)
  * Record “product walk” videos to request feedback and to showcase your features (Loom)
  * Low-latency pairing with other Engineers to make progress with the high context (Tuple)
  * 2-3 scheduled calls per week ( _yes only 2-3_ 🤩) everything else covered ad-hoc, async, through peer pairing or monthly 1-1s with your manager (Slack, Google Meet, Lattice)
  * Work on our customer dashboard building new UI/UX (React, Rails, Node.js)

**  
Skills and experience that will aid success in this role**

  * **4+ years** working full-time as an Engineer and **2+ years** of React experience
  * Experience collaborating with other engineers

  * Experience working with testing suites (RSpec etc.)
  * Self-motivated and independent; proactive in problem-solving and capable of structuring and managing your own work.
  * Be able to provide guidance and answers the first time, see blind spots and complexity before it impacts the flow of work

**  
Other requirements**

  * You have a fully functioning workstation and a quiet place to work (and take calls) with a high-speed internet connection (we’ll send you a new M3 Macbook Air with 16GB ram)
