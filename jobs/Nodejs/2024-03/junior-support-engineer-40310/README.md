_(Fully remote, async-first, DevOps SaaS, 40h/week, time zones: UTC+0 to UTC+3)_

Join Checkly, the company behind Monitoring as Code (MaC). We‚Äôre a fully remote startup on a mission to enable developers to detect and resolve issues 10x faster through code-driven synthetic monitoring. In other words, Checkly lets you know if something is wrong with your production website or API even before your end-users know. We‚Äôre a group of (mostly) engineers who love to ship quality stuff fast using the best tech for the job.

Thousands of developers are using Checkly already, including those at Vercel, Render, Sentry, 1Password, Crowdstrike, Deno, Autodesk and AutoTrader. For our role in starting the shift to Monitoring as Code, we have recently been recognized by Gartner.
