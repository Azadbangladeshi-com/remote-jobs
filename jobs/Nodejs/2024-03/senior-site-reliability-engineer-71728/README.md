Description

Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About Infura**  
Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

**What youâ€™ll do**

Be part of a world-class infrastructure and tools team responsible for core Infura engineering projects. Infura builds and supports a globally available, high-performance service. Modern tools and practices help our developers work safely and efficiently.

As a reliability engineer, you would be instrumental in building tooling for test automation, infrastructure as code, single panes of glass observability, Kubernetes, and execution tracing. Our reliability engineers are key in helping our SRE teams, engineering teams, and testing teams run efficient and secure infrastructure. Security, platform engineering, and right-sized capacity planning are key aspects of the reliability engineering work stream.

We work with infrastructure as code tools (e.g. Terraform), containers and container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes, EKS, ECS); event source / message based architectures (e.g. Kinesis, Kafka); frontend applications (e.g. React, nodejs, etc); both RDBMS and NoSQL Datastores (e.g. Postgres, Mongo, Redis, DynamoDb); Linux based operating systems; and of course blockchain and DLT. Understanding both traditional virtual server infrastructure, containerized workloads, and modern serverless workloads is a key part of the expertise we seek.

**Would be great if you brought this to the role**

  * The ideal candidate would have 7+ years of experience in a DevOps, system operations, or SRE role. 
  * Extensive experience troubleshooting, debugging, and working with microservices, Cloud Native, or Kubernetes/EKS.
  * Experience with Kubernetes/EKS and supporting components utilized to run k8s (e.g. karpenter, kyverno, promtail, prometheus, etc)
  * Experience with at least one or more of the following Infrastructure as Code frameworks: Terraform or Amazon CDK.
  * Infura maintains cloud-based systems, so deep experience with one or more cloud providers (bonus for AWS) is preferable.
