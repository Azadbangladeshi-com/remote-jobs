About BoomPop, Inc.  
Who we areBoomPop is on a mission to bring people together. We make it easy for you to have fun and connect on a human level with the people you work with, no matter where you are. We launched with amazing virtual events and quickly expanded to IRL (think: offsites, retreats, client summits, annual kickoffs) as well as a single platform that makes it easy for any company to manage everything in one place. Although we‚Äôre barely 3yrs old, we have over 5,000 clients (Google, Apple, Netflix, Nike, Accenture) and have brought over 200,000 people together so far. And we‚Äôre just getting started. Umm‚Ä¶ corporate events?Oh YES, corporate events. We, as humans, spend ‚Öì of our time working. And ‚Öì asleep. The majority of our life is spent with people at work! The tectonic shift that is remote work has left 57% of office space vacant (yeah‚Ä¶$1.7T of annual spend: poof), and companies such as Airbnb, Salesforce, Shopify, and Reddit are all adopting the new mantra: ‚ÄúOffsites are the new office.‚Äù
Companies around the world need help bringing their teams together and our goal is to make planning a company kickoff, client summit, or retreat as easy as buying products on Amazon. Watch. Us. Do. It. (Or actually, come help.) Group travel pre-pandemic was already 40% of the $800B corporate travel industry and it‚Äôs absolutely exploding as companies shift facilities spend to IRL events. (by the way, 73% of clients are managers planning events for the first time in their careers ‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt be their job.)
