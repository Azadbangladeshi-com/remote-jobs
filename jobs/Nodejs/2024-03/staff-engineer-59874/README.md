### Sparta Commodities  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Spain`  

### Hey, weâ€™re Sparta Commodities!

We are a Swiss, VC-backed scaleup with a global reach. Our mission is to digitize the commodity trading market and become the leading platform for traders in all commodities verticals. Weâ€™ve already gained significant market traction and are financially backed by Venture Investors.

We currently have a fantastic opportunity for a driven and passionate Staff Engineer to join our growing Engineering team, based remotely in Spain or the UK. This is a great career opportunity for an experienced and delivery-focused front-end, full-stack, or generalist developer to play a key role in the development and maintenance of premium commodity trading data products for a leading and highly regarded business.

We are a fully remote company with a modern tech stack, and we strive for fast deployments to support the rapid growth we are experiencing, this hire is key to our continued success.

### About The Team

Our naturally diverse teams are divided into verticals, with a mix of multidisciplinary members. Each team has at least four backend engineers, three frontend engineers, a designer, a QA engineer, a Product Owner, a Team Manager, and a Staff Engineer.

We work on bi-weekly sprints with quarterly goals. Each project is kicked off by a product request, from which we build a technical proposal that is refined within the team. Once the project has been greenlit one team member becomes its owner. An owner follows the project through development and deployment, making the other team members accountable for their responsibilities.

The technical direction of these teams is led by the Integration team. Formed by the CTO, VP of Engineering, VP of Data, SREs, and the Staff Engineers. This teamâ€™s goal is to keep the cohesion between squads and design the mid and long-term project that affects the infrastructure, continuous integration, and product quality.

### About The Tech

We have a modern frontend development stack, using the latest versions of React, modular SASS, and Vite. We have a friendly team of developers who love to stay updated with the latest improvements in the industry, as we target the latest 3 months of Chrome releases.

In 2024 weâ€™re going to build a dashboarding experience, investigate the benefits of SSR for our customers in other regions, and extract our Design System to its own reusable library.

### About You

We are looking for a pragmatic and generalist engineer who has had ownership of projects from inception until after release, and who is familiar with observability, product metrics, and maintainability. They will be involved in the design of technical solutions as owner and implementor, on top of reviewing designs from other team members.

On the day-to-day, you will lead a squad and will be their model for balancing product/business and engineering. Successfully planning and delivering complex, multi-system long-term projects, and exhibiting ownership across the organization.

As part of the integration team, you will define long-term goals and ensure the active projects are in service of them, define the strategic vision, and help reduce complexity to get more done.
