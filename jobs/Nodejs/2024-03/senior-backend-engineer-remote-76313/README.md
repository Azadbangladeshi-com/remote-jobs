 **About Localize:**

The Localize platform is used by 700+ companies to automate the translation of their web and mobile applications and bring their products & services to new markets at record speed. We help companies like Ahrefs to translate their website, NYU Langone Health to translate their urgent care scheduling page, and the University of Nebraska at Kearney to translate their international admissions page. To see our product in action, click any of those links and use the website's language switcher to switch from English to another language.

Localize works by providing a code snippet (similar to the Google Analytics JavaScript snippet) that our customers add to their website/web app. The Localize snippet pulls in content from the page into the Localize dashboard where our customers log in to add translations and manage their content. Localize automatically deploys those translations to the customer's production site, reducing development costs and accelerating time to market.

We are a team of ~20 people working fully remote. We offer competitive pay, a full benefits package, and a culture with an emphasis on work + life balance.

  

This position is only open to applicants who reside in and are eligible to work in the US.

Along with your resume, send us a cover letter that showcases your personality and tells us why we should hire you. Previous experience working in a remote position is a must.
