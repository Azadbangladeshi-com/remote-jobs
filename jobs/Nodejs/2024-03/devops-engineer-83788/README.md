# [DevOps Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/devops-engineer-83788)  
### Legatics  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

### We are hiring remotely for this role in Europe

### Help us simplify legal transactions

A large segment of the legal industry works on transactional legal processes. Building a wind farm, merging two companies or selling a skyscraper - lawyers help make these things happen and their work is surprisingly similar to planning and leading a technology project. There are documents to be produced, agreements to get signed, and a whole lot of detail to be understood, agreed and made clear. Thereâ€™s an order in which things need doing and there are stages that need to be complete before you can move on.

For example, how do you make sure that when you buy a building youâ€™re getting all the land you think youâ€™re getting? How do you make sure you donâ€™t fund a wind farm and then find that there is no permission to build it or that the people you funded are scammers? How do you make sure there isnâ€™t an ambiguous clause thatâ€™ll make it all go wrong? You get a lawyer to manage the transaction.

Since the dawn of Microsoft Word, this humble word processor has been the default way to manage these legal transactions. We want to change this, by building a platform that allows transactions to be managed online, and in a collaborative way. That means weâ€™re on a mission to transform the $600bn market for legal services worldwide.

Our customers include some of the worldâ€™s top law firms, such as Allen & Overy, Hogan Lovells, Herbert Smith Freehills, Shearman & Sterling and King & Wood Mallesons. And weâ€™ve been used on transactions in more than 60 countries.

### The Role

We are looking to hire a specialist DevOps engineer to join our team. The role is available at junior or mid level, dependent upon your skills and experience.

We see DevOps as a team-wide ethos and approach and something that involves all of our engineers - we arenâ€™t aiming to build a classical infrastructure operations team with a different name. Our goal is to have a group of experts who are responsible for infrastructure setup and configuration, monitoring and visibility but who also develop and deploy tools, reusable frameworks and components for use in product development and to help us optimise our infrastructure and working practices.

We are working towards full Continuous Delivery, using feature flags and canary or blue/green deployments to allow frequent, small releases to our production environments. We need to further develop our logging and monitoring solution, including adding advanced features around security and distributed anomaly detection.

We build web-facing applications, running on Linux, deployed in AWS and working in Agile teams. We work in feature teams, focussed on particular product and system areas. We use GitLab for source control and CI/CD tooling and use Kubernetes, Kustomize, EKS, Terraform/Terragrunt and shell scripting to define and configure our environments. We use React, node.js and Python, with GraphQL between front- and backend.

### What you will be doing

  * Assist in designing and implementing, with our development teams, scalable, reliable infrastructure, deployment processes and tools
  * Contribute to the automation and streamlining of deployment, testing, and release processes using appropriate tools, building on what we already have and extending with new capabilities where helpful
  * Monitor and optimise system performance and availability, helping engineering teams to troubleshoot and resolve issues as they arise
  * Develop and maintain documentation for infrastructure, deployment, and release processes
  * Participate in on-call rotation to provide support for production systems
  * Contribute to improving security posture and system reliability through continuous evaluation and recommendations
  * Work with Security team in security assessments and implementing best practices
  * Support Kubernetes clusters for container orchestration and deployment

### Who would you be working with?

### Steve Wheeler, CTO

Steve Howe, Devops Lead - who you will be reporting into, alongside a welcoming, inclusive and committed team.

Team culture is really important to us. We are looking for someone who is excited to join us as a key employee at this important stage in our growth and who will bring new and exciting perspectives to Legatics. We are a friendly and passionate bunch with a wide range of interests. We love to socialise together too, holding regular team events.

### Technology

We follow a microservices approach written in Node.js on AWS, managed using Terraform, Kustomize and Kubernetes. GraphQL and Apollo are used between front and backend. Our frontend is an SPA built with React and Redux, with some Ramda. We have a dedicated test / QA team, doing a combination of manual and automated testing.

We work according to DevOps principles and weâ€™re working towards full CI/CD, aiming for frequent small releases supported by feature flags, distributed config management, monitoring & tracing, etc.

### Power in diversity

We put users at the heart of our design to provide legal transaction experiences that everyone loves. In order to make that a reality, we seek to foster a diverse and inclusive working environment that can empower our people to be creative, effective and innovative, to build a brand we are proud of.

We donâ€™t discriminate against gender, race, religion or belief, disability, age, marital status or sexual orientation. Whatever your background may be, we welcome anyone with talent, drive and emotional intelligence. We're committed to building a diverse team and are constantly looking for ways to improve our processes to help us do that.
