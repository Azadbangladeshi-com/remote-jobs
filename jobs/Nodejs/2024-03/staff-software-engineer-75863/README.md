### The Company

Outschool's mission is to inspire kids to love learning. We achieve this by linking learning to kidsâ€™ interests, connecting them with other classmates who share their passions, and giving them the autonomy to pick their own paths. Our small group classes meet over live video chat with teachers who celebrate their unique strengths and empower all learners to develop confidence and a strong sense of self.

We're also focused on removing barriers for historically underserved learners who face systemic challenges to their success. Outschool.org is a nonprofit that partners with homeschooling co-ops, community-based organizations, and schools across the U.S. to provide marginalized communities with access to virtual and hybrid learning experiences.

We believe that diversity drives learning. To meet our mission, we encourage, support, and celebrate different ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds. As a fully distributed (remote) team, we challenge one another to find the most effective way to empower learners, teachers, and parents.
