# [Senior Software Engineer - Full-Stack - Web Platform team](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-full-stack-web-platform-team)  
### Pallon  
#### `üåé Switzerland`  

    
    
    üíß About Pallon

At Pallon, a spin-off from ETH Zurich, we‚Äôre creating AI that automatically detects defects in sewer inspection videos and advises cities on when & how to fix them. By providing more precise, objective data, we aim to fix wastewater leaks, reduce CO2 emissions, and prevent urban flooding. Our mission is to make cities more sustainable and resilient.

    
    
    ü§ù Your Team

You will join the small but dedicated platform development team. We are building a **complex and highly interactive web platform** that caters to two intriguing and challenging use cases.

 _1) The first part of our platform allows our customers, sewer professionals, to manage their sewer networks and engage with services like our AI-based defect coding and condition grading. Sewer network management is a collaborative effort, involving network operators such as cities, inspection companies, and engineering offices that work together to devise rehabilitation strategies. There is great value inbringing these workflows into a modern web application. Think about how Figma changed the design space by ‚Äújust‚Äù bringing design tools into the browser._

 _2) The second part of our platform is designed for our internal users, who perform quality control on our AI predictions. Sewer defect coding is incredibly complex, and even after inspecting thousands of kilometers of pipes, we still find surprises in the sewers (some of them we share in our_ Sewer-Wiz _posts). Given the high stakes of potential errors, we put considerable thought into streamlining the process while ensuring the highest quality. For this part of the platform, we do more than ‚Äújust‚Äù bringing existing workflows into the web; we innovate entirely new solutions, creating an exciting mix of creativity, metric-driven development, and frequent experimentation._

Among the features our platform team engineers have developed are:

  * A 3D viewer that enables users to virtually walk through their pipes and perform geometric measurements.

  * Wrote a type-safe foreign function interface to share business logic between TypeScript frontend and Python backend

  * A Domain Specific Language that allows us to accommodate various sewer defect coding standards in a scalable manner.

  * A linear programming matching algorithm used for the quality control of our quality control.

  * Build a design system that provides highly reusable, beautiful components, enhancing consistency between design and code.

We have a product-market fit and over 150 paying customers who love our platform and services. **Join us now to be part of scaling our industry-changing product!**

    
    
    üí™ Your role

Owing to the technical nature of our product, we actively involve engineers in product decision-making. Many of the ideas that distinguish our product have originated from our engineers. Our team members are engaged in end-to-end project work, from collaborating with product designers and making key technical and architectural decisions to setting up metrics that measure adoption and impact post-release.

### In this role you can expect to:

  * Leverage your previous experiences and existing information to make key technical and architectural decisions affecting how fast defects can be identified and repaired.

  * Wear a full-stack hat, while developing new features, from the blueprint to shipping production code, and contributing to all parts of our product and tech stack.

  * Write robust, well-documented, and easily extensible code.

  * Share your expertise with the team and help your peers grow as engineers.

    
    
    üöÄ Our tech stack

 _Note: we do not require experience in these exact technologies, but generally value a broad technical background: Full-Stack._

  * Frontend: Typescript, MobX, React, WebGL, Canvas.

  * Backend: Python, NodeJS, Typescript, Postgres, Django.

  * ### Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Docker.

  * ### Analytics: DBT, BigQuery, Metabase.

    
    
    üéØ You will be successful if:

  * **You gained profound technical expertise working with complex and highly interactive web applications.** Looking at the industry average; this can mean 5 years of having worked as a software engineer and building successful applications across different domains.

  * **You owned features end-to-end.** Meaning, that you can flex both your front- and backend experience, and demonstrate strong expertise that people come to you for.

  * **You have worked in smaller companies and teams.** So, you thrive in an environment where collaboration, proactive communication skills, and mutual learning and teaching are key.

  * **Are passionate about all things software engineering and want to build scalable complex systems.** This means you understand the importance of algorithmic understanding while understanding potential tradeoffs when making technical decisions.

  * **You can lead by example and know what great code looks like.** Ideally, you bring some experience with our tech stack.

  * Optional: Experience in project management and team/project leadership will be helpful as we all work highly independently while supporting each other where needed.

    
    
    üòé Benefits & team culture

### As a part of Pallon, you will:

  * Contribute to a positive impact on society and the environment

  * Develop a novel product that changes a whole industry

  * Work in a stimulating and fast-paced environment

  * Be part of a motivated, smart, fun, and supportive team

  * Own a part of Pallon and have a part in our success with our Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)

  * Work for the Underworld, not the Devil: exploring sewers virtually and in real life during our Pallon offsite

  * Work from home or enjoy access to our beautiful office space located in Z√ºrich

    
    
    Inclusion statement

At Pallon, we highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under-represented backgrounds to apply.
