### Retool  
#### `ðŸ’° 393000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### ABOUT RETOOL:

Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software: Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for internal use. This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies donâ€™t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows.

At Retool, weâ€™re on a mission to bring good software to everyone. Weâ€™re building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And thatâ€™s a mission worth striving for.

Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!

### WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU:

Our sales engineering team is critical to Retool. Sales Engineers drive revenue by partnering closely with potential customers and ensuring theyâ€™re successful with Retool.

Our revenue and business goals this year are aggressive, and we need the right team to help turn prospects into happy Retool customers.
