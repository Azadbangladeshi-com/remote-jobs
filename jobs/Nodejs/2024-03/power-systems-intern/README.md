### The Company

Camus Energy empowers electric utilities to transform how the grid operates for a reliable, affordable, and zero-carbon future. Our grid orchestration platform equips utilities with the tools to harness local energy resources to keep the grid running smoothly 24/7/365.

We combine world-leading experience pioneering high-reliability distributed systems at technology companies like Google and Meta with robust power systems expertise from across the energy sector. As the adoption of electric vehicles, rooftop solar, battery storage, and flexible loads continues to accelerate, utilities need partners who can help them orchestrate these local resources reliably at scale. Thatâ€™s where we specialize.

If helping utilities unlock the full potential of local energy resources sounds like the right challenge for you, letâ€™s talk.a

### The Role

Camus Energy is seeking a graduate intern who is excited about decarbonizing the grid! We are developing a grid orchestration platform to boost grid reliability, affordability, and resilience all while connecting and coordinating more renewable resource generators, energy storage, electric vehicles, and much more. This project involves modeling, benchmarking and visualizing power flow models for large distribution grids, specifically,

Project: Power flow modeling for distribution grids

### Minimum Qualifications

  * Graduate student majoring in electrical engineering or related field
  * Developing power flow models in OpenDSS from proprietary data formats
  * Benchmarking models via OpenDSSâ€™s python interface OpenDSSDirect.py
  * Quantifying metrics of interest & building tools to visualize data at scale
  * Self-starter, eager to learn more about the power distribution industry, and excited about the energy transition!
  * Experience or coursework with OpenDSS 
  * Proficiency programming in python (and standard libraries for scientific applications such as numpy and pandas) 
  * You are fluent in English

### Bonus

  * Experience with large distribution grid models such as the IEEE 8500 node test feeder
  * Scripting with OpenDSSDirect.py
  * Use of jupyter & colab notebooks for data analysis
