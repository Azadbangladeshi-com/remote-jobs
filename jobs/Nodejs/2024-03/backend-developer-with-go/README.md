Description

**Location:** Remote in Poland

  

**We create innovative, world-class engineering solutions**. We donâ€™t mean to brag, but in our daily work, we **solve unconventional problems you canâ€™t really google**. Whenever possible, we open-source our libraries and share them with the developer community.

  

About the role:

Youâ€™ll be a member of **the Platform API team** responsible for developing our core backend services.

Youâ€™ll develop the **API** used internally **in our products**. Thanks to that, youâ€™ll get to cooperate with various teams.

On top of that, the exact same API is used by **external developers** , who build LiveChat integrations. Your work will **shape** the entire **LiveChat Platform ecosystem** and the **LiveChat Developer Community**.

Youâ€™ll have **full ownership** of the features youâ€™ll work on. Youâ€™ll get to propose, design, and implement a solution. Youâ€™ll have our support all the way to fixing bugs on production ;-)

  

We work in SCRUM, but itâ€™s hard to describe a **typical day**. Your team will be divided into **technological** and **project groups** youâ€™ll be a member of. Sounds enigmatic? Weâ€™ll be happy to tell you more.

  

Our tech stack:

Go, node.js, C++

MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ

gRPC, Protobuf, Websocket

Weâ€™re open to experimenting with new technologies. We analyze each problem and choose the right tools to solve it.

  

Who are we looking for?

  

_T_ _echnical skills:_ You should know **at least the basics of Golang programming language.** Weâ€™re advocates of **software craftsmanship** , who truly care about the **quality** of their code. We hope you share these values, too.

  

_Soft skills & attitude:_ Weâ€™re a team of developers driven by passion, who enjoy each otherâ€™s company and like to joke around. At the same time, weâ€™re open to feedback, both positive and negative. We donâ€™t avoid difficult subjects but resolve problems by discussing them. Weâ€™ll get along well if youâ€™re **cheerful** , **ready to give & take feedback**, and **passionate about coding**. Your **enthusiasm** and **proactive approach** can make up for a more modest experience.

  

_Language skills:_ You need to have **very good knowledge of written and spoken English**.
