# About Us üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

  
We specialize in developing AI tools tailored for lawyers within corporate environments, akin to Grammarly but designed specifically for legal marketing tasks. Our innovative tool seamlessly integrates with popular task management platforms such as Jira, streamlining the legal marketing review process. Marketers and legal professionals leverage our solutions directly within familiar environments like Google Docs and Microsoft Office to identify and address potential issues within marketing content, effectively mitigating risks for their organizations. Companies spend hundreds to thousands of legal man-hours of manual marketing review each month, which is expensive and slows down the enterprise.  
  

  
We‚Äôre founded by former product managers, marketing lawyers, and early startup engineers with backgrounds like AWS, Meta, Lyft, and Block.  
  

# Why Join Now? üöÄ

  
We are a venture-funded company, and we‚Äôve raised a $4M seed round, so you‚Äôll have job stability while working on cutting-edge applied AI products. Our customer waitlist is rapidly expanding, comprising reputable, often publicly traded clients. We offer competitive compensation packages, accompanied by regular performance evaluations leading to title promotions and increased responsibilities for high performers. Embracing remote work, we provide flexibility while also facilitating regular on-site engagements to foster team collaboration and connection.
