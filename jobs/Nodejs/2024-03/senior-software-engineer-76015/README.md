### Trellis  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

### **What weâ€™re building and why weâ€™re building it**

Trellis is an insurtech start-up. Our mission is to build industry-leading solutions that make insurance easy for everyone, from consumers to partners to insurers. Our embedded insurance solutions bring the market's leading insurance brands into the apps and ecosystems consumers already use to help them find, compare, and purchase personal insurance, harnessing the power of their personal data.

Weâ€™re fast-growing! Our partners include 4 of the top 5 digital banks and 7 of the top 50 personal finance apps in both app stores, including Rocket Money (formerly Truebill), Albert, and Acorns. We have backing from multiple top venture capital investors, including QED (Credit Karma, SoFi), General Catalyst (Airbnb, Stripe), Nyca (Acorns, Revolut), as well as Amex Ventures.

Weâ€™re fully remote. We believe it allows us to find the best talent wherever it is, provide our team with maximum flexibility, and stand out to candidates.

Trellis is led by third-time fintech entrepreneur, Daniel Demetri, who has previously founded multiple fintech and insurtech startups that now operate as publicly-traded companies.

  1.  **Extreme Ownership** â€“ We fulfill our promises to each other and to our customers. We own our responsibilities 110%.
  2.  **Speed** â€“ We work quickly and pragmatically. We move fast and get things done.
  3.  **Craft** â€“ We are constantly learning and bettering ourselves and the way we work.
  4.  **Collaboration** â€“ We work transparently, solicit feedback, and leave our egos at the door.
  5.  **Positivity** â€“ We see a cup half-full, focus on the team's potential, and rise to challenges..
