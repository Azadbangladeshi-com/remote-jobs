 **ABOUT THE TEAM ü§ù**

The Rocket Money Engineering team is comprised of full-stack problem solvers, infrastructure builders, accessibility advocates, quality champions, systems thinkers, musicians, woodworkers, writers, actors, and more.

We‚Äôre building a rapidly-growing financial platform that helps millions of people to live their best financial lives. Our engineering team has met numerous technical challenges, from accommodating rapid growth, securely ingesting billions of financial transactions, to building a best-in-class mobile application that has been the #1 finance app in the App Store. Our work is impactful ‚Äì in just a few years, we‚Äôve helped millions of people to collectively save more than $1 billion.

We‚Äôre growing our team, and are looking for an Engineering Team Leader who can help us take our platform to the next level, building tools that will empower our other teams to do the same.

 **IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:**

  * Lead a small team focused on making our applications fast and reliable, and building internal tools to help other engineering teams write and ship code efficiently.
  * Build a team that is not only dedicated to building quality software, but is enthusiastic about empowering others to do the same. The team will act as stewards for our platform by improving processes, reducing technical debt, and advocating for scalable architecture.
  * Identify and implement strategies and metrics for assessing user-facing performance, work with your team to implement those strategies, and implement solutions for performance bottlenecks that you discover.
  * Lead the team in using profiling tools and techniques to pinpoint areas of the codebase that are causing slowdowns or inefficiencies.
  * Work with other engineering teams to identify pain points in their day-to-day activities, and work with your team to develop solutions to streamline processes that allow our developers to write, test, and ship code more efficiently.
  * Foster strong working relationships with cross-functional counterparts (in areas such as Cloud Architecture, Information Security, and QA) where problems are addressed directly, and decisions are made based on what‚Äôs best for our users, team members, and the business.
  * Work with a high level of autonomy and know when to escalate concerns or collect feedback. You‚Äôll own day-to-day decisions and have space to iterate on team norms and processes.
  * Be accountable for making, measuring, and delivering on team commitments, as well as pivoting when necessary in order to keep the team focused on the most impactful work.
  * Invest in your team by building and supporting growth plans with engineers and identifying opportunities to grow the team thoughtfully.

 **ABOUT YOU ü¶Ñ**

  * You are an engineer by trade, with a history of shipping production code and designing distributed systems to work at scale.
  * You have 6+ years of engineering experience, working with some combination of Node.js/TypeScript, React (or similar framework), GraphQL, and PostgreSQL (or similar relational database).
  * You‚Äôre comfortable identifying, owning, and solving problems from end to end, across domains, encompassing the full technical stack.
  * You have experience with profiling and Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools, and understand how to measure and assess user-facing performance.
  * You lead by example. You take pride in writing quality software, and provide tools and mentoring to help others do the same.
  * You‚Äôre pragmatic and empathetic. You seek to understand how performance issues impact users, and how process-changes impact developers. You seek to align your team‚Äôs efforts towards business outcomes, and strive to make that alignment engaging, exciting, and achievable.
  * You can tailor your management style to suit your team members, identifying where some people might succeed with a more hands-off approach than others.
  * Experience with FinTech or consumer apps is a plus.
