Description

**ABOUT ROCKET MONEYüîÆ**  
  
At Rocket Money, we‚Äôve built an app that enables people to save more, spend less, see everything, and take back control of their financial lives. With millions of users already onboard, we‚Äôre continuing to grow and are looking for a seasoned engineering leader to take our technical vision and execution to new heights. This role will take the reigns of our product engineering function, leading groups of full-stack teams as they work cross-functionally to deliver high quality user experiences and reliable systems.

  
 **ABOUT THE TEAM** **ü§ù**  
  
We‚Äôre looking for someone with a strong mind for both technical and organizational challenges, as well as someone who believes in sustainably growing an engineering team to balance velocity, team member development, and a healthy engineering culture.

 **  
ABOUT THE ROLE ü§π  
  
In This Role, You‚Äôll‚Ä¶**

  * Take ownership of the quality, reliability, and performance of a product that is used by millions of people. You‚Äôll be a critical escalation path for production incidents in addition to a guiding voice as the team works to resolve them.
  * Lead an organization that balances thoughtful, rigorous technical decision-making with rapid product iteration and experimentation.
  * Design systems that scale teams and people ‚Äì career ladders, development processes, team structures, etc.
  * Represent engineering in collaboration with the heads of product, design, data, marketing, and others to define and execute on a roadmap for our product.
  * Challenge organizational direction and advocate for the company we should be, not just the company we currently are.
  * Identify, attract, empower, and retain top engineering talent to build an organization that can execute against an ambitious roadmap.
  * Use your wealth of technical experience and expertise to set technical direction for the engineering department, and work with group leaders and a senior team to carry out that vision.
  * Empower the rest of the organization by driving the adoption of technical solutions and new tooling for complex problems.

 **ABOUT YOU ü¶Ñ**

  * You‚Äôre a builder at heart who is motivated by the challenges that exist at the intersection of designing a system and scaling a business. You have no desire to stay in your lane and focus on purely technical concerns.
  * You have experience building high quality consumer-facing applications and systems that support millions of users.
  * You‚Äôre a generalist who can participate in conversations across the stack, from React application logic through what‚Äôs happening on the backend and into the underlying infrastructure on which the code is deployed.
  * You‚Äôre eager to dig into code, systems, and architecture to understand how the system works and where it can be improved. You‚Äôre an engineer who leads, not just a leader of engineers; opportunities to look at the code and talk through it with someone on the team are cherished.
  * You scale processes to the needs of the organization rather than the other way around, understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to organizing a team. What works for a team of 2,000 engineers doesn‚Äôt necessarily work for a team of 200 engineers.
  * You have deep familiarity with most of our stack and challenges ‚Äì scaling AWS infrastructure, operating large PostgreSQL databases at scale, shipping mobile applications to the app stores (ours are built with React Native), and designing/deploying Node/Typescript applications.  
  

 **WE OFFER üí´**

  * Health, Dental & Vision Plans
  * Competitive Pay
  * Matching 401k
  * Unlimited PTO
  * Lunch daily
  * Snacks & Coffee
