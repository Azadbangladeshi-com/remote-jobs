### Kojo  
#### `ðŸ’° 270000.0` `ðŸŒŽ Canada`  

### **About Kojo**

It's time to build. Whether it's creating more housing, upgrading our infrastructure, or adapting to climate change, one thing is clear: the construction industry is at the center of solving our biggest problems. Weâ€™re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.

Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we canâ€™t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, thereâ€™s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.

 _ **This role will include:**_

  * Co-owing the delivery of a product that transforms the construction industry

  * Serving as an integral part of building engineering, product, and company roadmaps

  * Helping support the continued growth of Kojoâ€™s engineering organization, from process, to hiring, to culture

###  **About you:**

### What youâ€™ve accomplished:

  * Proven track record of shipping quality software _(3+ years professional experience preferred)_

  * Deep experience working with Typescript, GraphQL, Node, Docker, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL

  * Comfortable with a wide range of AWS technologies, such as RDS, EC2, S3, Beanstalk, Lambda, and other common services

  * Inside knowledge of WebSockets, HTTP, FTP, and other networking protocols as well as RESTful APIS and OAUTH authentication flows

  * B.S. in CS or a related field, or equivalent experience

  *  _Bonus:_ Experience with integrating with third-party APIs and databases, working with another construction or ERP software, and/or familiarity with Datadog, Sentry, or other application/platform monitoring systems

  *  _Bonus:_ Architecting monorepos, infrastructure as code, CICD pipelines, and other DevOps related configurations

### What you care about:

  *  **Customer Obsession:** You care deeply about our customers and go the extra mile to delight them

  *  **Intentional Communication:** You have a bias towards written communication and documentation to open up access to your thinking, and you listen with openness and curiosity.
