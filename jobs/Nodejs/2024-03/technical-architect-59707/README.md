# [Technical Architect](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/technical-architect-59707)  
### MLabs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ United Kingdom`  

We are currently seeking a Full-time **Technical Architect** on behalf of our Client for the Constitutional Committee (CC) role. This position is crucial as the first Constitutional Committee for Cardano is set to go live after the Chang upgrade in 2024. The CC plays a pivotal role in Cardano's governance process, focusing on upholding the Cardano Constitution by assessing the constitutionality of on-chain governance actions.

As the CC tooling is not yet mature, our client is looking for a Technical Architect to understand, prepare, document, and train the CC members on the suite of tools required to fulfill their role. The initial focus will be on supporting the CC in their current responsibilities, including testing and identifying tooling, providing technical support, creating technical documentation, and conducting training sessions.

Upon successful completion of the initial phase, there will be a need to design and define user-friendly tools for the constitutional committee, reducing barriers to entry for other community members. This may involve selecting, customizing, and preparing polling tools for the constitution work in 2024.

 _ **Please be aware that the availability of this role is contingent upon MLabs Ltdâ€™s Client agreeing to and signing a contract with MLabs Ltd. Until such a contract is signed, the job offer is considered conditional.**_

###  **Duties** :

  * **Support preparing the constitutional committee**
  * **Testing and identifying tooling:** User acceptance testing (UAT) of the tools that the constitutional committee will use. This includes cardano wallets, CLI, DBsync, X.509 credential management, using sites like the Cardano Forum, the Voltaire GovTool, Swagger UI and others that may need to be explored to fulfill the UATs.
  * **Technical support** : Support constitutional committee members on how to set up and operate the tools identified and defined through the UAT. For example, setting up a Cardano node to run the CLI, instructing how to interface with the CLI and wallets to vote, checking the progress of on-chain governance actions, advising on credential management configurations, creating metadata hashes, advising on metadata storage, aggregation of technical information relevant to governance actions, and checking that on chain governance actions match the off chain proposal. This support will be necessary for an in-person training event, and may be needed following initial training so that the members are ready to serve on the constitutional committee.
  * **Technical documentation** : User guides for the CC tools need to be created for multiple roles within the constitutional committee. This will include a user guide for credential management, voting, and registering/retiring as a constitutional committee member. This may include providing technical details within other documentation of processes like assessing governance actions, on-chain voting, and the election process.
  * **Training** : Support in-person and online training related to the tooling for the constitutional committee members. This will include supporting a private testnet to allow learners to go through the exercises of voting on-chain before mainnet is available. This may include tailoring the technical user guides for training sessions and preparing for a dry run of all processes with Q&A.
  * **Architecting new user friendly tools**
  * Understanding the business requirements, architect user friendly tooling for the constitutional committee members of Cardano. Ensure the designs are secure, working with the Cardano blockchain and where appropriate, integrates with existing tooling. This may include collaborating with software development vendors and across organizations. Produce easy to understand documentation of the architecture.
  * **Support getting the interim constitution on-chain**
  * Helping to understand the requirements to get the interim constitution hashed, a testing plan and testing to prepare for the hard fork. This includes helping to incorporate the interim constitution into the genesis file for the Chang hard fork.
