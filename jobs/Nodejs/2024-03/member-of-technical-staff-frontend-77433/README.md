Runway is a research company pioneering new tools for human imagination. Runway has been at the forefront of multi-modal AI systems ensuring that the future of content creation is accessible, controllable and empowering for creatives. Runwayâ€™s mission is to ensure that anyone anywhere can tell their stories. We believe that deep learning techniques applied to audiovisual content will forever change art, creativity, and design tools.

Runway is leading a shift to generative media that is unlocking an unprecedented level of creative potential. The invention of the camera 200 years ago forever changed our world â€“ AI is a new kind of camera that will reshape storytelling forever and lead to full feature films that are entirely generated.

###  **About the role**

Weâ€™re looking for a Senior Software Engineer for our Frontend team to help us build cutting-edge, AI-powered video creation and collaboration tools. Rather than specialists, weâ€™re seeking curiosity-driven engineers who are determined problem solvers and thrive in fast-paced, high-ownership environments. Our engineering team is highly collaborative and works on a wide variety of exciting challenges, including developing new interfaces for AI content creation and deploying cutting-edge computer vision and generative models to production.

### A peek at our technical stack

The rich UI of our generative AI tools is powered by **Typescript** and **React/Redux,** while the real time compositing and graphics engine behind our interactive preview runs on **WebGL2** and **WebAssembly.** Our API endpoints for real-time collaboration and media asset management are written in **Typescript** and **node.js** and are deployed as serverless functions on **AWS Lambda**.

### What youâ€™ll do

  * Create rich multimedia interfaces using the latest, cutting-edge AI video generation models: Gen-1 and Gen-2
  * Work with a world-class engineering team pushing the boundaries of creativity and content creation on the browser
  * Take on new challenges across the Frontend stack to implement new product features for Runwayâ€™s machine learning based generative AI tools
  * Improve the performance, reliability, and code quality of our codebases

### What youâ€™ll need

  * 3-6 years of industry experience in a software engineering role, ideally frontend focused
  * Demonstrated fluency of one or more programming languages, including but not limited to Javascript/Typescript
  * Experience in architecting production-ready systems and familiarity with debugging and profiling tools
  * Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines
  * Humility and open mindedness; at Runway we love to learn from one another
