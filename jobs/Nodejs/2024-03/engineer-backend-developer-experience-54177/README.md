## **About You**

**You love building.** You have 5-7 years of experience as a Software Engineer building and shipping distributed, scalable web-applications. You're familiar with Python, CI/CD, service bootstrapping, and you enjoy driving improvements across the DX journey: Design, Develop, Test, Release, Run, Observe, Evolve, and Scale. Zapier is built on Python, Django, React, Node.js, and AWS with Terraform, Gitlab CI, and Docker and previous experience with some of these technologies will help you hit the ground running.

**You are an advocate for the developer experience.** You identify internal developer platform capabilities that are missing or need improvement. You are proactive and empathetic in working with developers to understand their challenges and needs. You drive sustainable solutions and patterns that can be applied across engineering teams.

**You value collaboration.** You understand that building modern software is a team sport, and you enjoy working as part of a tight-knit team. Youâ€™re happy to pitch in and help the team, whether by reviewing code, pairing on a tricky problem, or brainstorming with the team about how to solve the challenges weâ€™re facing.

**You value exploration and versatility.** You are comfortable learning about other teamsâ€™ codebases and implementation. This will involve working with other teams, becoming familiar with their developer workflow, and collaborating with stakeholders on the other teams to solve engineering wide challenges.

**You are vocal and discerning about development best practices.** Your opinions on development best practices and software design are informed and assertive. You understand the delicate balance between meticulous planning and pragmatic decision-making. This insight enables you to identify which decisions require careful deliberation and where agility and shortcuts are appropriate, ensuring that development is both strategic and adaptable to the dynamic needs of the project.

**You advocate for the user.** You have a keen eye for developers' needs, and youâ€™re empathetic to the needs of the end-user. When you see users struggling to succeed you take it as a personal challenge to understand why and help the team build a better product.

**You care about the 'why' more than the 'what'.** Your approach to engineering isn't just about ticking boxes or following directives. You deeply value clarity and purpose in your work. If priorities seem nebulous or not optimized, you're confident and proactive in seeking clarity, ensuring that the team's efforts align with the broader vision. Misalignments don't escape your keen eye, and you're quick to flag them, ensuring that the team remains on a coherent and impactful trajectory.

â€‹â€‹ **You embody the "let's make it work" ethos.** Challenges, whether monumental or minuscule, don't deter you. You dive in with a can-do attitude, unfazed by the magnitude or nature of the task. You understand that in the broader scheme of things, not every task will be about building the next flashy feature. Sometimes, it's about fortifying the foundations, ensuring that the system is robust and resilient. You're discerning enough to know when to invest time in hardening the system versus when to prioritize speed. In essence, you're a true team player, understanding that every task, no matter how glamorous or mundane, plays a pivotal role in the team's collective success.

## **Things You Might Do**

Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:

  * Directly impact how our customers can be more productive by building and supporting the foundational building blocks for shipping code at Zapier.
  * Set standards for how applications at Zapier are built with our internal application bootstrapping tools and templates.
  * Refactor or improve existing code as languages, frameworks, or techniques evolve. Help the team pick appropriate tools to solve new problems as they arise.
  * Work closely with our product engineering teams to make it easy for them to ship code fast.
  * Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to help us become a better, more effective organization.
  * Help teach your colleagues new skills, through code review, discussions and mentoring. Help us all become better engineers and humans.
  * Help Zapier ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.

Youâ€™ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your growth at Zapier as we believe that each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute in all areas. We encourage collaboration and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist with projects.

## **How to Apply**

At Zapier, we believe that diverse perspectives and experiences make us better, which is why we have a non-standard application process designed to promote inclusion and equity. We're looking for the best fit for each of our roles, regardless of the type of education or companies in your background, so we encourage you to apply even if your skills and experiences donâ€™t exactly match the job description. All we ask is that you answer a few in-depth questions in our application that would typically be asked at the start of an interview process. This helps speed things up by letting us get to know you and your skillset a bit better right out of the gate. Please be sure to answer each question; the resume and CV fields are optional.

After you apply, you are going to hear back from usâ€”even if we donâ€™t see an immediate fit with our team. In fact, throughout the process, we strive to never go more than seven days without letting you know the status of your application. We know weâ€™ll make mistakes from time to time, so if you ever have questions about where you stand or about the process, just ask your recruiter!

Zapier is an equal-opportunity employer and we're excited to work with talented and empathetic people of all identities. Zapier does not discriminate based on someone's identity in any aspect of hiring or employment as required by law and in line with our commitment to Diversity, Inclusion, Belonging and Equity. Our code of conduct provides a beacon for the kind of company we strive to be, and we celebrate our differences because those differences are what allow us to make a product that serves a global user base.

Zapier is committed to inclusion. As part of this commitment, Zapier welcomes applications from individuals with disabilities and will work to provide reasonable accommodations. If reasonable accommodations are needed to participate in the job application or interview process, please contact jobs@zapier.com.

**Application Deadline:** The anticipated application window is 30 days from the date job is posted, unless the number of applicants requires it to close sooner or later, or if the position is filled.

_Even though weâ€™re an all-remote company, we still need to be thoughtful about where we have Zapiens working. Check out this resource for a list of countries where we currently cannot have Zapiens permanently working._
