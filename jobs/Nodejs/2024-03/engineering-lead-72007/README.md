Letâ€™s build a safer and simpler web that anybody can access.

  

 **Overview:**

We are searching for an Engineering Lead who will be a critical member of our engineering team, and help spearhead the build of our account abstraction wallet that makes buying a token as easy as buying a share in Robinhood.

  * Degree in Computer Science, a related discipline, or commensurate experience.
  * 7+ years of professional software engineering experience.
  * A demonstrable passion for web3 and the future of the decentralized web.

  * Mastery of mobile development using React Native, Typescript, and NodeJS is highly preferred.
  * Experience in agile project management processes.

### Bonus:

  * Prior development experience with web3.js or ethers.js.
  * Experience with Solidity and the EVM.

### Why you might be excited about Fire:

  * Build the next generation of user experiences of Web3: You will be part of the next generation of how users use crypto and Web3.
  * Launch new product lines from scratch: From initial idea and rapid user testing to world-class products used by millions of consumers - you'll love every step of the way. Be a part of shaping our roadmap and helping us execute.
  * Tangible impact and quick feedback loops: Our team members have shipped features that have doubled metrics overnight. Say bye to waiting weeks or months before anything fun happensâ€¦
  * Shape our product culture from the ground up. You'll help define our product processes, values, working rhythms and more.
  * We're backed by Atomic. When entrepreneurs co-found with Atomic, they team up with an experienced group of operators who have started dozens of companies, and created billions of dollars in enterprise value.
