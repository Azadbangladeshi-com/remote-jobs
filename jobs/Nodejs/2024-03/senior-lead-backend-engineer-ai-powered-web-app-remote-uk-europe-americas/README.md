# [Senior/Lead Backend Engineer, AI-Powered Web App - REMOTE UK/Europe/Americas](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-lead-backend-engineer-ai-powered-web-app-remote-uk-europe-americas)  
### Mimica Automation  
#### `üåé United Kingdom`  

### What we are building

Mimica's mission is to accelerate the discovery and deployment of automation with AI. Our first product, **Mapper** , learns patterns from employee clicks and keystrokes, identifies key steps, decisions and exceptions in user data and generates ‚Äúblueprints‚Äù for automation. Today, it supports RPA teams, that build software bots for repetitive computer tasks such as data entry, form completion and claim processing. Alongside creating process maps for automation, we've launched a companion tool, **Miner** , which helps enterprises identify and prioritize automation opportunities.

### Our approach to engineering

  * We prioritize customer needs first 
  * We work in small, project-based teams 
  * We have flexibility in terms of the problems we work on
  * We own the full lifecycle of our projects
  * We avoid silos and encourage taking up tasks in new areas
  * We balance quality and velocity
  * We have a shared responsibility for our production code
  * We each set our own routine to maximize our productivity

### Your mission

In this role, your mission will be to enhance and scale the backend systems powering the Mimica platform. This means designing and implementing a scalable architecture, developing and optimizing backend services and APIs, improving the performance and reliability of existing components, and taking operational responsibility for what you build. As a member of our early engineering team, you‚Äòll have the opportunity to shape our technical direction, processes and culture.

###  **Part of your day-to-day**

  * Contributing to architectural decisions and collaborating across teams to identify and implement product improvements.
  * Developing and optimizing a real-time backend service that enables multiple users to edit graph data and re-train AI models through their input.
  * Creating libraries and building APIs in our Node backend to interact with the various ML components of the system.
  * Diagnozing fault-tolerance and availability issues, as well as performance bottlenecks, and resolving them.
  * Refactoring our components and services and producing documentation for your implementations.
  * Providing feedback to peers through pair programming and code reviews and helping those around you to level up.
  * Participating in hiring and onboarding new team members; taking on end-to-end project management responsibilities as we grow.

### Requirements

  * Background in backend engineering, focusing on developing high-performance production software and scalable architectures.
  * Proficiency in in JavaScript/TypeScript, and a willingness to utilize various modern frameworks and technologies (e.g., Docker, K8s) to build high-throughput, low-latency systems.
  * Practical experience in designing APIs and managing databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB), with a keen eye for query optimization and efficient data storage & handling.
  * Commitment to upholding high engineering standards, prioritizing code quality, maintainability, reliability, and security.
  * Strong analytical and troubleshooting skills ‚Äì methodically decomposing systems to identify bottlenecks, determine root causes and implement effective solutions.
  * Drive to continually develop your skills, improve team processes and reduce debt.
  * Fluency in English, with effective communication skills ‚Äì articulating complex ideas, concepts, and trade-offs clearly.  

### Bonus

  * Experience owning projects from start to finish, including speccing, architecture, development, testing, deployment, release and monitoring.
  * Firm grasp of distributed systems concepts and techniques ‚Äì microservices, load balancing, caching, horizontal/vertical scaling and stateless architectures.
  * Working knowledge of secure software design principles and familiarity with secure communication protocols and data protection mechanisms.
  * Experience working within a high-impact, high-ambiguity startup environment ‚Äì delivering value quickly and iteratively.
  * Active interest in AI, automation, or related fields.

 **We‚Äôd love to hear from you, even if you feel you don‚Äôt quite have all of the skills mentioned above!**

### Benefits

We take a structured approach to determining salaries and take into consideration our salary framework, market data, and candidates‚Äô skills. We also offer health benefits and ample paid time off, as well as a range of non-tangible benefits like flexible schedules and location, start-to-finish project ownership, and the opportunity to contribute to projects that will change the future of work.

### Location

This is a fully remote position. You can be based anywhere in the UK, Americas, or Western Europe **within a UTC-6 to UTC+1 timezone.**
