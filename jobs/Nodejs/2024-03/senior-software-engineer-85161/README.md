### Company Description

### Job Description

What if you could use your technology skills to develop a product that impacts the way communitiesâ€™ hospitals, homes, sports stadiums, and schools across the world are built? Construction impacts the lives of nearly everyone in the world, and yet itâ€™s also one of the worldâ€™s least digitized industries, not to mention one of the most dangerous. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re looking for a talented **Senior Software Engineer** to join Procoreâ€™s journey to revolutionize a historically underserved industry.

As a **Senior Software Engineer** at Procore, youâ€™re given the unique opportunity to partner intimately with our customer base, translating their fundamental needs into technological SaaS solutions. Backed by the might of our teams, weâ€™ll provide you with the tools and resources needed to achieve extraordinary results that render a significant impact extending beyond the boundaries of traditional engineering roles.

This position will report to our Software Delivery Manager and will be **based in our Cairo, Egypt** location. Weâ€™re looking for someone to join our team immediately.

 **What youâ€™ll do:**

  * Help establish standards for development teams and collaborate on initiatives with infrastructure, platform, and other software engineering teams
  * Assist fellow teammates by conducting code reviews and pairing
  * Leverage our tech stack: Primarily Ruby/Rails/Node.js/React/Postgres hosted on AWS and increasingly using Kubernetes and languages such as Java and Typescript, CircleCI for Continuous Integration, and a combination of Spinnaker and an in-house tool for CD.
  * Drive critical projects, including: 
    * Delivering Software at Scale: Weâ€™re growing rapidly and need engineers ready to take on the challenge of building our next-generation CI/CD pipeline to enable hundreds of other developers to deliver high-quality software safely at a high velocity.
    * Delivering Services at Speed: Weâ€™re continuing our transition to a service-oriented architecture, and we need to build, test, and deploy pipelines that allow developers to put their services into production quickly and safely, with a minimum of handoffs to other teams.
    * Software Delivery Observability: We intend to become an elite performer in the software industry, and we can only do this if we learn and adapt quickly. We need telemetry from our software delivery systems to continually learn how to improve our lead time for changes, our change failure rate, and our mean time to recover from failure.

 **What we're looking for:**

  * Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience
  * 5+ years experience in software engineering fundamentals, Test Driven Development and Design principles (React, Javascript, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Python, or similar languages preferred)
  * Understanding the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term goals and balancing immediate needs with strategic initiatives
  * Track record of anticipating technical problems that will fall out of major projects and designing solutions to overcome those problems
  * Experience in working with software, platforms, and infrastructure at scale (we run thousands of hosts and have millions of users) 
  * Experience in building modern Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery systems at scale
  * Experience working with a team on large initiatives with the ability to course-correct as needed
  * Experience working with modern web development, including testing, staging, deploying, and monitoring
