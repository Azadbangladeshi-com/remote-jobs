**Introduction üëã**

  

Hello. We're Prismic.

We are on a mission to change the way the web is being built. As this is not an easy task, we need platform engineers to design, implement & evolve our state-of-the-art system architecture.

  

We aim to create a Website Building experience that is both enjoyable & productive for marketing & development teams by simplifying their workflows and eliminating the barriers between them.

  

Many call us a headless CMS or API-based CMS, but we like to think beyond the technical architecture we provide. We believe our job doesn't stop at providing an API to developers or a UI to marketers who will figure out how to work with it. That's why we're investing heavily in an ecosystem of open-source tools, APIs & web applications. Our headless CMS puts the developer & marketer experiences at the very center through intuitive workflows & seamless integrations.
