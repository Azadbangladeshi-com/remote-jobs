# [Senior Protocol Engineer, Node](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-protocol-engineer-node)  
### OP Labs  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Worldwide`  

We believe Ethereum has the potential to solve some of humanityâ€™s most crucial coordination issues. Since our initial inception as a research group, we have sought to scale both its technology and values.

At present, the most pressing bottleneck to the growth of Ethereum is its performance and scalability. We are building the most elegant solution to this problem. We do this in the open (under an MIT open source license) because we believe in open source innovation and its ability to accelerate growth.

OP Labs is building Optimism mainnet, and by extension, the infrastructure that powers all OP-Stack chains. We are improving Ethereumâ€™s performance by orders of magnitude and donating the profits from doing so to funding Ethereum public goods. By operating as a Public Benefit Corporation, OP Labs can align its incentives with the public good and take positive-sum steps toward a sustainable future for the internet.

What are the role responsibilities?

  * Work alongside the OP Labs Protocol Team to build the Optimism protocol
  * Act as a main driver of the core OP Stack development process. E.g. develop op-geth, op-node, op-batcher, and op-proposer
  * Implement protocol upgrades
  * Work with the OP Labs DevInfra team to maintain the production networks (OP Mainnet & Sepolia) and the wider Superchain infrastructure
  * Support additional core development teams in contributing to the OP Stack

What skills do you bring?

  * Extensive experience in a software engineering role shipping production code
  * Significant experience developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts to mainnet
  * Deep knowledge of Ethereum and the EVM
  * Strong grasp of computer science and distributed systems fundamentals
  * Experience writing Go and Solidity or a willingness to learn

What will you like about us?

  * We take care of our employees. Competitive compensation, fully paid medical, dental, and vision, and a 4% 401K matchâ€”learn more about our benefits, culture, and all recruiting FAQ here.
  * We take pride in the accomplishments of our teammates and support each other in doing the best work of our careers.
  * Our team is a diverse group of people from varied backgrounds. We cherish our eclecticism and consider it a great strength.
  * Weâ€™re fully remote, deeply engaged, highly skilled, and like to have fun.
  * We think long-term. Our founders have been scaling Ethereum since 2015.

**We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds to apply.** We believe that our work is stronger with a variety of perspectives, and weâ€™re eager to further diversify our company. If you have a background that you feel would make an impact at Optimism, please consider applying.
