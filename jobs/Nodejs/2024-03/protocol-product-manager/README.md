  * Analyze the industry to establish trends and opportunities
  * Influence Mina Protocol Roadmap with customer, industry, and technology insights
  * Identify and track metrics
  * Evaluate and prioritize specific opportunities and areas of improvement (e.g. TPS, node operator experience, block time, etc) for the Mina protocol
  * Develop product requirements (PRDs)
  * Collaborate with other o1Labs engineering teams, including sdk, crypto, and platform.
  * Be familiar with PM tooling, such as Github, Figma, Notion, or similar.

**Ideal candidates will have** :

  * 1-3 years of previous experience in product management of one or more successful products or services, ideally in a web3 company.
  * Some understanding of blockchain or distributed systems
  * Strong technical background
  * Strong project management skills. You should like getting things organized and out shipped.
  * Strong communication skills
  * Familiarity with technical concepts such as APIâ€™s, GraphQL, blockchains or distributed systems, etc
  * Experience with cryptography, zk, or proof systems is a bonus

**About Us**

O(1) Labs has developed the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our remote team is spread across the world, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

The US base salary range for this full-time position is $143k to $180k and equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role and level. The range displayed on each job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for the position for remote roles. Within the range, individual pay is determined by role, level, and additional factors, including job-related skills and experience. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range during the hiring process.

We have recently brought Mina Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets (22KB). Mina can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cell phones to be fully verifying nodes. We're now working on catalyzing a new generation of apps powered by zero-knowledge cryptography

We believe it's important to incorporate diverse perspectives from conception through realization. This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity, as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
