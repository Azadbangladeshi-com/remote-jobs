 **Why You'll Love This Role**

Are you excited about enabling customers to find, refine, analyze, and leverage their operational data, no matter where it lives, regardless of format or storage medium? Cribl Inc is looking for an Engineering Manager to lead and grow a new, remote-first, diverse, inclusive, cross-functional team of software developers focused on the Cribl Search product, as we execute on our mission to unlock the value of all observability data. Cribl Search flips observability on its head by distributing queries to where your data already lives and aggregating the results - no more expensive data replication, centralized aggregation, megaIOPS+petabyte storage, or kilocore+terabyte hosts required to see what‚Äôs going on in your deployed environments. Want to find specific events, trace an execution, identify a threat, or graph metric trends from (ex.) data stored in EBS volumes, Cribl Edge nodes, Splunk, S3 buckets, Azure blob stores, containers, RDBMSes, data lakes, or even a custom datastore? How
about being able to do that from a single pane, regardless of heterogenous storage / location / hosting / on-disk format? That‚Äôs what Cribl Search enables, and we think it‚Äôs a game-changer for helping Cribl become the data engine for IT and security.
