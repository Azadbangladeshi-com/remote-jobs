**About Mercy Corps**

Mercy Corps is powered by the belief that a better world is possible. To do this, we know our teams do their best work when they are diverse, and every team member feels that they belong. We welcome diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skills so that we can be stronger and have long term impact.

**The MicroMentor Team**

MicroMentor is an initiative of Mercy Corps and functions much like a technology start-up. Through a proprietary online mentoring platform, MicroMentor provides a technology solution that connects small business owners and entrepreneurs with skilled volunteer business mentors on a global scale. In addition to managing the general community of users, MicroMentor provides a niche product offering to corporations, international NGOs and government entities as a program-implementing partner.

**The Position**

As a member of MicroMentor‚Äôs web services development team, the Senior Software Engineer will collaborate in maintaining and further evolving and expanding MicroMentor's multi-target mentoring platform, both in the front- and backend. The ideal candidate brings deep experience in serving online communities on web and mobile, and offers direction and tutelage to our younger software developers, while driving the team‚Äôs velocity with best-practice aware, test-driven, and peer-reviewed coding. This is very much a hands-on, take action and lead by example role. While collaborating with internal and external stakeholders to understand the product vision, its mission and, eventually, feature requirements, the major majority of the day will usually go to developing code and reviewing PRs.

MicroMentor‚Äôs technology stack includes primarily Node.js Express based server applications with MongoDB data storage, plus a Flutter based multi target, mobile-first frontend. This role requires deep experience with all key components in the backend: Scalable server applications, sysops, data aggregation, analytics and, to some degree, integration with a business intelligence solution. Secondly, experience with frontend applications, both web and mobile, are essential for this position. MicroMentor does not require extensive experience with native mobile application development, but having built hybrid mobile applications, such as with Flutter, React Native, Ionics or Cordova will be very helpful to hit the ground running.
