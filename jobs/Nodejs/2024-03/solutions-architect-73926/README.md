# [Solutions Architect](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/solutions-architect-73926)  
### Airbyte  
#### `ðŸ’° 320000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  
Airbyte is the open-source standard for EL(T). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt pre-built connectors to their needs. So far, we've built over 350 connectors and have had 35,000+ companies replicating data with us. We've raised $181M from some of the world's top investors (Benchmark, Accel, Altimeter, Coatue, Y Combinator, etc.) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls. Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in Silicon Valley. Weâ€™re fully transparent as a company.
