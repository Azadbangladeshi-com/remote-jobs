 **About Localize:**

  

The Localize platform is used by 500+ companies to translate websites and applications into other languages. We help companies like Trello to translate their help center (https://help.trello.com/), Tinder to translate their blog (https://blog.gotinder.com/), and RocketMiles to translate their web app (https://www.rocketmiles.com/) - to see our product in action, click any of those links and use the website's language switcher to switch from English to another language.

  

Localize works by providing a code snippet (similar to the Google Analytics javascript snippet) that our customers add to their website / web app. The Localize snippet pulls in content from the page into the Localize dashboard where our customers login to add translations and manage their content. Localize automatically deploys those translations to the customer's production site.

  

We are a team of 12 people working fully remote. We offer competitive pay, a full benefits package, and a culture with emphasis on work + life balance.

Remote (within North America)
