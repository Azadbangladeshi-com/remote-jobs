### Isla  
#### `💰 100000.0` `🌎 United Kingdom`  

🕙 **Role details:** This is a full time role for 40 contracted hours per week

💷 **Salary** : £46,000 - £54,000 per annum based on experience and track record

🌍 **Location** : We are a hybrid team, based throughout the UK. We offer the flexibility to work outside of the UK up to 90 days per year, however you must be able to **work and live permanently within the UK** , and travel to London every few weeks for team meeting sessions.

Isla enables healthcare systems to deliver next level healthcare, meeting the challenges of global increase in demand for services through an efficient new model and technology platform. We provide clinicians with the platform they need to receive a continuous flow of clinical information from patients and create an always up to date understanding of a person’s health. This provides valuable clinical context for decision-making whilst delivering convenient care for patients, empowering clinical teams to deliver responsive care with fewer appointments. The Isla platform is intuitive, endlessly scalable, and approved by NHS Digital as a cloud storage solution.

### The Team

We are a growing team dedicated to improving healthcare. We are ambitious, customer focused, and driven by the impact we are having in healthcare. We’re also a well funded startup, which brings a level of uncertainty, but also agility and growth opportunities unlike anywhere else.

You will work directly with our other Engineers and Founders to ensure you're developing professionally, as well as happy, motivated, and understand the wider business & health context that we are working in. The people around you will be super smart and motivated, and expect a lot from you. That will be exciting for you.

### The Tech

Isla is a healthcare platform with an Angular app deployed to Firebase as a user facing component, supported by Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub and Docker via Cloud Run. Connectivity with our clients is largely handled via the Google Healthcare API, in addition to private VPC access via the NHS HSCN (Health & Social Care network). We store some data in a Redis DB and some in a Postgres DB to fit with our user query needs. In terms of testing, we use Jest for unit tests, Cypress for component tests and Playwright for end to end tests. We run our end to end tests on multiple environments through Lambdatest before release.

You will be our only dedicated quality & testing engineer across a growing team of currently 12 other developers. We have a strong quality culture in which developers write unit, component and end to end tests, as well as a product team who are very quality focussed, adding edge case handling/ testing requirements to tickets as we scope out work.

We are looking for a dedicated quality engineer to continue to extend our component & end to end test coverage, build on the quality processes that we already have in place, support our squads & other developers in their testing approaches and support releases to ensure the team can maintain a high bar for quality whilst continuing to move as quickly as possible.

### Over the next 12 months you will:

  * Test Automation Development:
    * Design, develop, and maintain our end to end tests, ensuring we are prioritising high risk, low coverage areas of the code base
    * Collaborate with development teams to integrate automated testing into the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline
  * Code Review:
    * Participate in code reviews to ensure that testability has been considered and tests are implemented in line with expectations
    * Collaborate with developers to address and resolve issues identified during code reviews
  * Test Planning and Strategy:
    * Contribute to/ lead test planning and strategy discussions
    * Work across the tech team (engineering, product, design, support) to identify and prioritise test cases for automation
  * Continuous Improvement:
    * Stay updated on industry best practices, tools, and technologies related to testing and test automation.
    * Proactively identify opportunities for process improvement and efficiency

### Requirements

  * 2.5+ years of relevant experience (as specified below)
  * Programming Skills:
    * Proficient in the testing frameworks that we are using already (Jest, Cypress or Playwright)
    * A reasonable understanding of the broader development tools/ frameworks (JavaScript/TypeScript & Nodejs, Angular)
  * Testing Knowledge:
    * Strong understanding of software testing principles and methodologies
    * Knowledge of different types of testing (e.g., functional, integration, and/or performance)
  * Development Practices:
    * Experience with Git
    * Awareness of serverless infrastructure (Cloud Run / Cloud Functions)
    * Knowledge of CI workflows (Github Actions)
  * Communication and Collaboration:
    * Strong communication and collaboration skills
    * Ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams
    * Ability to work independently, with the confidence and communication skills to support other team members in implementing new process & technologies

Recruitment is not one-size-fits-all and we're happy to tailor our hiring process to better meet the needs of individual applicants. Please email recruitment@isla.health with any requests for support.

### Using AI tools for your application

Most of our roles include several questions as part of the application process. AI tools such as ChatGPT might be useful in structuring or proof-reading your cover letter or your application answers. We encourage you to do your own research though to fully understand the company and the role you are applying to as you will be asked questions during any interview. Generic AI-generated answers are also really obvious. We'd like to get an idea of how you think early in the process; you should also make sure Isla is the right fit for you before you apply. Make AI tools work for you, not against you!
