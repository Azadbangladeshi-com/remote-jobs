Weâ€™re looking for an experienced backend software engineer to work on building remarkable experiences for Sanityâ€™s content platform.

###  **Who are we?**

Sanity.io is a modern, flexible content platform that replaces rigid legacy content management systems so companies like **PUMA, Spotify, Figma, Riot Games** , and **Skims** can create amazing digital experiences for their customers.

One of our big differentiators is treating content as data so that it can be stored in a single source of truth but seamlessly adapted and personalized for any channel without extra effort. Forward-thinking companies choose Sanity because they can create tailored content authoring experiences, customized workflows, and content models that reflect their business.

Backed by Netlify, Vercel, the founders of Twitter and Medium, Herokuâ€™s ex-CEO, and leading VCs like ICONIQ Growth, Threshold Ventures, and Lead Edge Capital, Sanity is at the epicenter of the modern digital product development stack.

You can only build a great company with a great culture. Read about our values and join us in building a diverse and inclusive team.

###  **About the Role**

As a backend software engineer, your role will involve delivering functionalities that drive the platform functions of Sanity, such as the management interface, billing/metering systems, identity management, and third-party integrations.

This team has a huge problem space to explore and deliver solutions to help Sanity and our customers excel in their respective domains. Weâ€™re all remote first and highly experienced, motivated people with cross-functional backgrounds.

  * Build secure, well-tested, observable code.
  * Enjoy taking ownership of ideas from conception through to production.
  * Experience working with Go and PostgreSQL.
  * Able to clearly and concisely communicate technical designs and thinking verbally and in writing.
  * Experience working at a product/SaaS company.

### Nice to haves:

  * Experience with Google Cloud Platform.
