### Lyka  
#### `ðŸŒŽ TELECOMMUTE Australia`  

### **Description**

 **Who are we?**

Lyka is an Australian founded pet wellness company thatâ€™s shaking up an outdated industry and paving the way for happier, healthier pets. Despite medical advancements, animal lifespans are on the decline. Today, the average pet only reaches 37% of their full potential lifespan and statistics have shown us that many suffer from dental disease, cancer, and obesity. Simply put, the status quo is not enough.

As humans, weâ€™ve experienced firsthand the positive impact fresh wholefoods can have on our health and wellbeing, and we believe our furry friends deserve the same. We're on a mission to do just that, starting with nutritionally balanced, wholefood meals delivered direct to doors around Australia. As the worldâ€™s most sustainable pet wellness company, weâ€™re putting pets and our planet first â€” one bowl at a time.

Today, we are proud to share weâ€™ve served almost 30 million meals to puppers and their parents across Australia, and this is just the beginning. Our vision is to create multiple nutritional products, adding disease prevention meals and supplements, and expand into new markets.

Currently, we have a team of 200+ pet-obsessed and we're continuing to grow (yes, looking at you!). These carefully selected people are dedicated to building the next generation of technology and products to help empower pet parents to take control over their petâ€™s wellbeing.

To date, we have raised over $60M in funding from venture capital investors and pet industry insiders, who believe in our mission and ability to drive change in a stagnant industry, providing nutrition that nourishes puppers from the inside out.

Are you ready to shake things up and give pets the life they deserve? Come join our pack!

 **Our Mission**

The time we share with our pets is being cut short. Despite medical advancements, theyâ€™re getting sicker earlier. Theyâ€™re dying prematurely. The industry has it backwards â€” prioritising treating symptoms instead of addressing the root cause. Thatâ€™s where we come in.

At Lyka, we take a preventative, holistic and personalised approach to pet care. We look at the full picture, factoring in the diet, lifestyle and environment of each individual animal.

We donâ€™t stop at symptoms, instead we dig for the root cause. We create nutrition plans unique to each pet, because itâ€™s not just about living longer, but living well too.

Our mission is to double the average lifespan of dogs and cats by 2050.

###  **About Lyka**

Pet food. An unregulated industry, based on a sub-par product that's not seen innovation since the 1950â€™s, with kibble being prepared at 300 degree temperatures and designed for a shelf life of up to 25 years.  
  
Lyka is here to change this. Weâ€™re making human-grade dog food with love right here in our Sydney kitchen that prioritises nutrition rather than shelf life, and itâ€™s our mission to improve the lives of every Australian dog (we even try the food ourselves).
