# [Senior Software Engineer, Hardhat](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-hardhat)  
### Nomic Foundation  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote in UTC+2 to UTC-4 timezones`  

The **Nomic Foundation** is a non-profit advancing the Ethereum ecosystem. We build open-source runtimes, compilers, build systems, and deployment solutions that are used by tens of thousands of developers. We emphasize robust engineering and lean processes, allowing for quick decision-making and distraction-free software development. You have the opportunity to shape the future of the Ethereum ecosystem through deep technical work on critical developer infrastructure, where your specific contributions will have a tangible impact.

  
**About the team:**

The Hardhat team builds our established and market-leading products. These are user-facing infrastructure that developers use to write, test, compile, and deploy their Solidity contracts for Ethereum. Our users depend on our products for their end-to-end experience of building software. We deliver these features at scale, with users ranging from beginners learning the ropes to teams managing production systems with billions in user on-chain capital at stake. We aim to provide the Ethereum ecosystem with a professional developer tool that they can rely on to rigorously build, test, and maintain Ethereum software.

**This is a fully-remote role, and weâ€™re open to candidates applying within UTC+2 to UTC-4 timezones.  
**  

**What you'll do:**

  * Work on an open-source project
  * Help triage Github issues and support users
  * Tackle large, complex, and ambiguous projects, starting from a set of high-level product requirements
  * Identify and/or clarify requirements and analyze tradeoffs, risks, dependencies, user value, and non-functional requirements
  * Deep dive into user pain points, concerns, and requests
  * Independently solve tasks that range from complex design/architecture issues and complex previously unknown blockers to churning through coding tasks and bugs at a high pace
  * Uncover unknowns or gaps and prototype solutions for major risks
  * Act as a force multiplier for the team
  * Contribute to project management and roadmap planning. Youâ€™ll outline risks and dependencies and break down scopes and roadmap items into tangible milestones while optimizing for fast delivery
  * Keep timely communication with management stakeholders, other engineering teams, and other functions
  * Coach other engineers on technical topics

  

**Who we're looking for:**

  * At least 5 years of experience as a software engineer
  * 2+ years of working with **TypeScript**
  * Knowledge and experience with **Node.js** , particularly if it involved tooling development
  * We work remotely and mostly asynchronously, so the ability to take ownership and work with minimal direction is crucial
  * As this is an expansive **open source** project, in a rapidly changing ecosystem, we are seeking a teammate who is comfortable adapting to changing requirements
  * Prior experience working in a **remote** and globally-distributed environment
  * **Enthusiasm** for the prospect of shepherding a major open source project and a cornerstone of Ethereum development

  

**Compensation & Benefits:**

  * Unlimited PTO
  * Budget for hardware equipment
  * Annual Learning & Development Budget
  * Vesting ETH grant as part of total compensation
  * Statutory benefits specific to your location (depending on the employment contract)

  

**Why join us?**

**Mission-driven value creation**

Your contributions will directly impact an ecosystem that is shaping the future of finance, data, and ownership. You wonâ€™t be working on optimizing a revenue stream to increase shareholder profits; youâ€™ll create value for the Ethereum community and developer ecosystem.

**Lean and robust**

We run robust engineering practices and lightweight processes that provide us with structure and fast decision-making. Your time will be spent on technical challenges, coding, and launching features.  
  

_We value diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We recognize they are essential to growth and innovation, and sometimes the perfect candidate might not tick every box in the job description. If you're passionate about what you do and have valuable experience - we want to hear from you. Your unique background and skills could be just what our team needs and we warmly encourage you to apply._
