### Help us simplify legal transactions

A large segment of the legal industry works on transactional legal processes. Building a wind farm, merging two companies or selling a skyscraper - lawyers help make these things happen and their work is surprisingly similar to planning and leading a technology project. There are documents to be produced, agreements to get signed, and a whole lot of detail to be understood, agreed and made clear. Thereâ€™s an order in which things need doing and there are stages that need to be complete before you can move on.

For example, how do you make sure that when you buy a building youâ€™re getting all the land you think youâ€™re getting? How do you make sure you donâ€™t fund a wind farm and then find that there is no permission to build it or that the people you funded are scammers? How do you make sure there isnâ€™t an ambiguous clause thatâ€™ll make it all go wrong? You get a lawyer to manage the transaction.

Since the dawn of Microsoft Word, this humble word processor has been the default way to manage these legal transactions. We want to change this, by building a platform that allows transactions to be managed online, and in a collaborative way. That means weâ€™re on a mission to transform the $600bn market for legal services worldwide.

Our customers include some of the worldâ€™s top law firms, such as Allen & Overy, Hogan Lovells, Herbert Smith Freehills, Shearman & Sterling and King & Wood Mallesons. And weâ€™ve been used on transactions in more than 60 countries.
