Hello!  
  

Anthony here, Co-Founder of AdCopy.  
  

We're seeking new talent to add to our fast growing team here as we continue to innovate digital advertising with AI. We've spent the past year growing our AI Powered Ads software that publishes ads to Facebook, reads ad accounts for optimization and is destined to be a complete optimization + ad launching suite. Our ultimate goal is to make media buying nearly autonomous by users leveraging our technology.  
  

As our backend engineer and Employee #3, you will be a pivotal (and early) part of our core team and help us build the scalable foundation associated with our product roadmap. We're poised to reach tremendous heights and would love to have you join us for the ride as an early stage employee that wants to participate in building something BIG.

If you can't tell, we want you to get creative here with us. Your input will be held in high regard, so quality of work + experience should be in line with those expectations as you're making a serious impact on the project.

Please DO NOT APPLY if you are reaching out on behalf of an agency or aren't fully capable of completing the scope at hand at a high level... But If this sounds like something you can tackle with confidence - start your cover letter with AdCopy 2.0 to get bumped up the stack and we'll begin to discuss things!  
  

This will begin as contract commitment of 20-40 hours per week and expected to expand to a full time opportunity.  
  
In your application, tell us how your impact on AdCopy will be different than any "regular" developer. We won't take this lightly, want to know who you are and what sets you apart. This job comes with meeting deadlines and hard work which will also go in tandem with tremendous opportunity for growth and perhaps the opportunity to become a shareholder. If you've been looking to become part of something to make a serious impact that's felt and have a voice in your company, then look no further.  
  

**Compensation & Perks (the good stuff)**

\- Competitive hourly rates for premium developer talent.  
\- Company allowances for wellness, learning and growth (upon full time)  
\- Flexible schedule and fully remote work  
\- Massive room for growth and potential shareholder opportunities on the table. You are an early and core team member.  
\- Get to develop something that will be ahead of the curve for advertising data. Join us in innovation.
