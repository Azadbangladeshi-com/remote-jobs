# [Senior Android App Developer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-android-app-developer)  
### Rising Academies  
#### `ðŸŒŽ TELECOMMUTE Accra, Greater Accra Region, Ghana`  

### **Description**

 **The context:**

Across the developing world, more children than ever are in school â€“ but they are not learning. A recent study estimated that less than 1% of school children in Sub-Saharan Africa attend a school where the teaching meets basic standards of quality. At Rising Academies, weâ€™re changing that, and we want your help. Our mission is to create the best schools and the most powerful teaching and learning tools for the people that need it most. Weâ€™re one of the fastest-growing quality-focused education companies in Africa, and a Certified B CorpÂ®.

**About us:**

We own and operate our own great value private schools, partner with governments to improve the quality of public school systems, and use our content and technology to help other education providers. Founded in Sierra Leone in 2014, we provided emergency education to children kept out of school by the Ebola Epidemic before opening our first school in April 2015. Today, we serve more than 250,000 students across more than 900 schools in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana and now Rwanda.

Through great curriculum, intensive teacher coaching and actionable data, we help teachers and school leaders bring quality to every classroom. And we get results: independent studies show Rising students make more than twice the progress of their peers in comparable schools.

We have recently closed our Series A funding round and won a multi-year, multi-million dollar grant to accelerate the development of our digital ed-tech solutions for low-income students across the globe. Our â€˜Bambaiâ€™ suite of digital tools already includes a school information system, school observation tool, chatbot tutor, accelerated learning program and teacher coaching app. This is just the start. We want to expand our range of digital products to help improve the quality of education for millions of students around the world. If you want to make a difference to the lives of teachers, students and parents, then we are the right place for you.
