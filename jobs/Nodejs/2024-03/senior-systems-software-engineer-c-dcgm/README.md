Description

NVIDIA is looking for outstanding software engineers to work on NVIDIAâ€™s Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM) software. In this role you will work closely with the broader NVIDIA team to design and build Linux-based management agents, CLI tools and end-to-end integration solutions that combine GPUs with the rest of the data center software management ecosystem. We are focused on supporting NVIDIA products across HPC, cloud and enterprise on both bare metal and virtualized platforms as the role of GPUs in all of these environments expands rapidly.

Your contributions will span many aspects of GPU system integration, including telemetry and metrics, health checks, diagnostics, configuration, accounting and policy. These tools fill roles of both passive background monitoring and active online management with a core emphasis on operational transparency and seamless integration in customer environments. Your code will support single node developer systems through large clusters with thousands of nodes. To be successful, you will need to have a strong Linux C/C++ background, familiarity with distributed software development, and a proven work ethic. You will be expected to jump in quickly and provide important contributions from day one. This is a dynamic work environment with many exciting opportunities awaiting. NVIDIA GPUs are central to many hot trends in the enterprise, cloud and datacenter. Come join us as we craft the future of accelerated computing and AI!

 **What we need to see:**

  * BS or higher in Computer Science or equivalent experience.

  * 5+ years of meaningful industry experience with a strong C++ development background

  * Familiarity with modern C++ standards (C++17/C++20). User space development and debugging expertise under Linux environments

  * Experience with APIs and interface design. Experience with IPC and Multi-threading

  * Outstanding written and verbal interpersonal skills

  * Strong motivation and commitment to learn new skills

  * Ability to implement all aspects of the software development lifecycle

  * Ability to manage time in a fast, heavily multitasked environment

  * Experience writing unit and system tests to ensure the correctness of fixes and new features

 **Ways to stand out from the crowd:**

  * Development experience with Python, Go, and Rust. Experience with Jenkins and GitHub/GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Experience with containers, common orchestration frameworks and common logging/telemetry backends

  * Experience with APIs and interface design. Exposure to GPU programming with CUDA. Experience with enterprise software development. Experience with cross-language interfaces (FFI, swig, etc.) in Go (CGO), Python, and Rust.

  * Experience with metrics gathering/monitoring best practices. Experience with Open Telemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, etc. Good understanding of extensive distributed systems and data-center operations/limitations.
