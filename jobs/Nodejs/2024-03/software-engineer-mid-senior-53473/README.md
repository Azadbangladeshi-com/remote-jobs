  *  **Web-app architecture design.** You have curiosity or understanding of how everything fits together from web services up through display and love designing reliable and extensible systems
  *  **Adaptability.** Weâ€™re a startup and project needs can change quickly. You love to jump into a new problem, learn whatâ€™s needed, and solve it
  *  **Customer-centric mentality.** You care about the user, strive to understand their needs and build tools to solve their problems.
  *  **Leadership.** With rapid growth, we need and expect everyone to be a leader. You have the humility and self-awareness to understand and navigate the unknown while holding yourself and others to a high bar. Additionally, you enjoy mentoring and fostering the development of fellow engineers

###  **Nice to have:**
