### Aledade  
#### `ðŸ’° ~0k` `ðŸŒŽ Remote,Houston, TX`  

As a Staff AI/ML Infrastructure Engineer, you will lead teams of engineers to develop ways to harness knowledge from one of the most extensive data sets of medical records, diagnoses, claims, and prescriptions. In this process, you will improve the efficacy of patient identification and delivery methods. You will enjoy the flexibility of being a part of a U.S.-based, permanently remote engineering and platform team. You will engage with stakeholders across multiple teams to lead the design, development, and productization of machine learning systems and solutions that help improve health outcomes for patients.

  

At Aledade, you will sit at the intersection of:

 **A huge problem** ; amounting to trillions of dollars of waste in U.S. Healthcare spending.

 **An approach that moves the needle** ; In the U.S., we wait until someone has a stroke, then are hospitalized. From there, no expense is spared. Using technology, Aledade changes that by enabling doctors to intervene with the proper preventive care, like blood pressure control, before it becomes a stroke.

 **A platform that works at scale** ; last year 11,000 physicians across 36 states served ~1.7M patients, saving 24,000 unnecessary hospitalizations and 120,000 visits to the emergency room using Aledadeâ€™s technology.

  

 **But the journey is only 1% done,** come join us to build a world-class team that will not quit till it addresses the trillions of dollars of suffering in U.S. healthcare spending

  * Architect systems to improve the relevance and drive business outcomes by making large, complex data sets more accessible. 
  * Work closely with Product Management, Practices, Sales, Customer Success, and other stakeholders to understand product usage patterns and trends and to make data-driven decisions and forecasts.

As the engineering team grows, you will lift the people around you:

  * Mentoring and galvanizing new engineers to do their best work.
  * Working across disciplines to shape a product strategy and execution.

 **Who We Are:**

Aledade, a public benefit corporation, exists to empower the most transformational part of our health care landscape - independent primary care. We were founded in 2014, and since then, we've become the largest network of independent primary care in the country - helping practices, health centers and clinics deliver better care to their patients and thrive in value-based care. Additionally, by creating value-based contracts across a wide variety of payers, we aim to flip the script on the traditional fee-for-service model. Our work strengthens continuity of care, aligns incentives, and ensures primary care physicians are paid for what they do best - keeping patients healthy. If you want to help create a health care system that is good for patients, good for practices and good for society - and if you're eager to join a collaborative, inclusive and remote-first culture - you've come to the right place.
