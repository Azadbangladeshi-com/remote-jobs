ClassDojo's goal is to give every child on Earth an education they love.

We started by building a powerful network for communication. ClassDojoâ€™s flagship app is the #1 communication app connecting K-8 teachers, children, and families globally. Teachers use it to share whatâ€™s happening throughout the day through photos, videos, and messages that make parents feel like theyâ€™re there. Itâ€™s actively used in over 95% of US schools, reaching over 50 million children in 180 countries, with a team of just around 200 people [1]. We are now beginning to use this network to give kids the best learning experiences in the world, far beyond those a standard school can provide.

We hire for talent density. Our team comprises the most talented, entrepreneurial, and innovative teammates from around the world, with experience in education and large scale consumer internet companies, including Instagram, Netflix, Dropbox, Stripe, Uber, Y Combinator, and more.

As a full-stack engineer at ClassDojo, you'll help build the systems that will support our rapid growth. Youâ€™ll work on production code from day one in a pair programming environment, deploy often, move quickly, and have your work used by millions of students, teachers, and parents around the world every day. In addition, youâ€™ll help us further develop our high-quality engineering culture, one that values rapid iteration, collaboration, and best practices. Our code is heavily tested and deployed daily, and weâ€™re serious about building a world-class engineering team.
