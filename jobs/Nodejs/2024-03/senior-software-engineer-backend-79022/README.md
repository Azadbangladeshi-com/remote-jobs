Description

#### Scout Motors

Here at Scout Motors, we're carrying forward the heritage of one of the most iconic American vehicles in history. A vehicle dating back to 1960. One that forged the path for future generations of rugged SUVs and will do so once again.

But Scout is more than just a brand, itâ€™s a legacy steeped in a culture of exploration, caretaking, and hard work.

Scout is all about respect. Respect for the environment by developing all-electric vehicles with the capability to get you to any location. Respect for the past and the future by taking an iconic American brand that hasnâ€™t been around for a while, electrifying it, digitizing it, and loading it with American innovation. Respect for communities by creating a company that stands for its people and its customers. And respect for both work and play, with vehicles that are equally at home at a camp site, a job site, or on a Tuesday commute.

At Scout Motors, we empower our talented, inclusive, and entrepreneurial teams to innovate. What makes a Scout? Someone who is a visionary and a leader, who seeks new paths and shares lessons learned. A knowledgeable doer who collaborates across the company to build better. A go-getter with unrivaled passion.

Join us at Scout Motors and be part of shaping the future of transportation. If you're ready to drive change and make history, apply now!
