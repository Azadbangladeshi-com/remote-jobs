Description

#WeAreCrowdStrike and our mission is to stop breaches. As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing over 1 trillion events a day with a petabyte of RAM deployed in our Cassandra clusters - and this traffic is growing daily. Weâ€™re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to developing and shaping our cybersecurity platform. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.

 **About the Role:**

Organizations are scaling their data environments at an increasing rate, leaving massive gaps in visibility into activity on endpoints, in particular, _knowing what endpoints are there to begin with!_ These evolving, heterogeneous environments are immensely difficult to protect because thereâ€™s no single-pane-of-glass visibility clarifying what machines (both virtual and physical) comprise the environment to begin with. Our team is looking to hire a **Sr. Cloud Engineer** to join our Falcon Exposure Management team. You'd be a part of the engineering and delivery of an infinitely scalable and instantly deployable real-time application that allows companies to quickly identify and eliminate malicious or noncompliant activity by providing unmatched visibility into the devices, containers, systems, users and applications in their network.

Youâ€™d be joining a team of backend-focused developers who work primarily in Golang, Kafka, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Docker/Kubernetes, and AWS-native services, making use of distributed/micro-services based architecture to build features for our highly available cloud SaaS platform, Falcon.

  * Lead the engineering efforts and architectural design of an application meant to scale to billions of processed data points 

  * Work with and mentor a team of highly skilled and dedicated engineers

  * Ability to design scalable and resilient microservice-based architectures, including clean REST APIs and streaming communication channels 

  * Strong programming skills either in Go or in Java, C++, Node.js or similar, with willingness to use Go. 

  * Deep understand of multithreading, concurrency, and parallel processing 

  * A thorough understanding of engineering best practices from appropriate testing paradigms to effective peer code 

  * Cloud Infrastructure Knowledge: AWS or GCP / Azure 

  * Team player skills â€“ we embrace collaborating as a team as much as possible 

  * Lead and Mentor junior team members with task detailing and directing execution for software development. 

  * Communication with product management to understand and execute requirements.

  * Collaborate with multi-functional team in various physical locations 

**Bonus Points:** â€‹
