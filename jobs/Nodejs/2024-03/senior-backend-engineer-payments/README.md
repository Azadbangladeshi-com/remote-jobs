Weâ€™re on a mission to empower every person to own their inner potential, and weâ€™re seeking candidates who want to impact our journey.

Empowering the world starts with living our values and empowering our team. As a quickly growing company focused on helping people live healthier and happier lives, we work to promote work-life balance and ensure that our team members have what they need to do their best work â€” both in and out of the office. We have offices in San Francisco and San Diego for those who prefer hybrid or office settings and employee hubs, including New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, and more.

Weâ€™re seeking an experienced Senior Backend Engineer to join our growing Software engineering organization in the USA. Weâ€™re made up of a set of cross-functional squads, each with a specific area of ownership across the Oura product. You will work on the Checkout Squad, improving the experience and resiliency for customers to purchase rings and begin their health journey with Oura.

 **What youâ€™ll do:**

  * Be part of a revenue-generating organization with a charter to increase Ouraâ€™s brand recognition, drive online sales, and build an intuitive user experience to drive traffic and foster customer loyalty and retention. We focus on both D2C and strategic partnerships with retail partners.
  * Be a key contributor on our Checkout Squad, helping to shape and define the architecture and approach to our backend systems as we continue to scale. Youâ€™ll be expected to be comfortable doing technical discovery, planning, leading design reviews, and leading feature development through delivery and beyond.
  * Collaborate with Product, Security, TPM, and engineering leaders across Oura to deliver critical business initiatives.
  * Contribute technical expertise to the team, while mentoring and leading more junior engineers.
  * Champion engineering excellence, establish key metrics, and drive continuous operational improvements.

We would love to have you on our team if you have any of the following, but don't worry too much if you don't fill in all the requirements:

  * 6+ years of backend development experience
  * A doer who enjoys working in a start-up environment - mission-driven, action-orientated, adaptable, comfortable with ambiguity
  * Hands-on experience with processing payments and integrating with payment processors like Braintree, Stripe, etc.
  * Deep experience with Typescript/Javascript and the NodeJS ecosystem. 
  * Experience with API documentation tools (Swagger, etc.)
  * Deep experience with automated testing (Jest)
  * Well-versed in the RESTful design principle and can build APIs that are intuitive, secure, testable, performant, and extensible.
  * Have an operational excellence mindset and can design and build systems with actionable metrics, error messages, and logging messages.
  * Leverage tools like Datadog and Sentry to proactively monitor the health of our systems and discover disruptions or optimization opportunities
  * Strong communicator and collaborator. You should be able to help initiate and steer conversations with the team and product managers that relate to your work.
