FHI 360 has an exciting internship opportunity for a student interested in growing their skills within the international development sector. Under close supervision, an Intern will perform entry-level professional duties which will provide the opportunity for professional training in various functional areas throughout the organization. Internship assignments serve to offer practical experience and broad exposure to a global nonprofit development organization.

At FHI 360â€™s National Institute for Work and Learning (NIWL), we believe that equitable access to quality education and fulfilling work empowers people to reach their highest potential. Thatâ€™s why NIWL focuses on two key drivers of individual well-being: education and employment. In the 50 years since our founding, the ways in which individuals and communities navigate work and learning have transformed dramatically. NIWL is housed under the U.S. Business Unit.

NIWLâ€™s Research Team serves as both an internal evaluation team for NIWLâ€™s college and career-readiness programs and an external evaluation team for several clients, including Cherokee Nation, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, American University, and North Dakota Regional Education Agencies. Our work includes evaluation planning and quantitative and qualitative methodsâ€”survey design, implementation and analysis, secondary data analysis, data dashboards, interview and focus group question design, implementation and analysis, and report writing.

Under NIWLâ€™s supervision, the Intern will assist with evaluation of projects serving youth who have had justice system involvement or serving other marginalized populations. Tasks will include online research and secondary data collection, developing tables to present data, qualitative data collection, writing research briefs, and supporting Research Team members.

This is a paid internship with a flexible schedule based on project needs.
