 ** **About Salesforce****

Weâ€™re Salesforce, the Customer Company, inspiring the future of business with AI+ Data +CRM. Leading with our core values, we help companies across every industry blaze new trails and connect with customers in a whole new way. And, we empower you to be a Trailblazer, too â€” driving your performance and career growth, charting new paths, and improving the state of the world. If you believe in business as the greatest platform for change and in companies doing well and doing good â€“ youâ€™ve come to the right place.

Monitoring Cloud is seeking engineers to architect, implement, deliver and operate our monitoring & analytic services that run in the public cloud at massive scale.

Monitoring Cloud is an integral part of the Salesforce Infrastructure that provides key insights for all development teams to quickly detect and remediate incidents to ensure the highest availability of Salesforce products for our customers. This cloud owns the entire telemetry stack starting with the agents that emit, collect and ship telemetry to large-scale backend systems that store data and enable efficient and low-latency queries to provide valuable insights. We support all the key pillars of telemetry - metrics, logs, traces and events at massive scale. Our teams have built these services using a combination of open source technologies and home grown technologies, both of which were essential at Salesforce scale and this has been architected from the ground up to run efficiently in the public cloud.  
  
We are looking to add engineers, with experience building and owning distributed services, who can step up and own big chunks of this vision on these projects. Youâ€™ll be challenged to blend customer-centric principles, industry-changing innovation, and the reliable delivery of new technologies. You will work directly with engineering, product, and design, to create experiences that reinforce the Salesforce brand by delighting and wowing our customers with highly reliable and available services.

  * Work with engineers on the design, deployment, and continuous improvement of observability services (i.e., logging, monitoring, and alerting).

  * Implement fault-tolerant systems and disaster recovery mechanisms, minimizing downtime and ensuring uninterrupted data access as well as identifying and eliminating bottlenecks, reducing latency, and improving query execution times, ensuring our observability platform runs at peak efficiency.

  * Collaborate with cross-functional teams to drive innovation within our platform, optimize infrastructure resources, and reduce operational costs while maintaining high availability
