### Vitally  
#### `ðŸ’° USD 205000.0~205000.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  

At Vitally, we know the most powerful tools or cleverest feature sets aren't worth much if the end-user struggles with their interface, and we need help building out and improving our user-facing code base as we add new features and scale our product to serve more customers. If you have experience building high-quality web apps that are easy to maintain and extend, we want to chat.  
  
 **We'd love to find someone with these traits to join the team:**

  * You are an exceptional engineer with excellent problem-solving skills
  * You collaborate well with designers, customer-facing teammates, and other engineers to deliver helpful features and improvements with solid technical foundations.
  * You are comfortable with javascript frameworks and the javascript/node ecosystem in general.
  * You write beautiful and usable web interfaces with semantic HTML and clean, understandable CSS (or scss/less/css-in-javascript)
  * You're familiar with common server-side systems and patterns (ORMs, job systems, MVC frameworks, restful apis, etc.)
  * You have at least 4 year of professional coding experience (preferably with some focus on client-side web development)

### Additional points if you:

  * Have extensive experience with Node, Typescript, React, & Redux
  * Have experience working with relational databases (we use Postgres)

### Some work you might do:

  * Build a calendar or kanban-style view for tasks in the Vitally product
  * Help implement a visual builder for automation flows that allows users to create complicated systems that are easy to set up, change, and understand
  * Build green-field user-facing features like new integrations, independently or in collaboration with a back-end developer (depending on your skill set)
  * Improve and augment our existing set of reusable components and document them in our style guide
  * Review existing components and features for usability and accessibility and make improvements
  * You tell us! We're proud of the work we've done so far, but there's always room for improvement. You'll be encouraged to take ownership of the codebase and product and surface work that *you* think is most valuable
