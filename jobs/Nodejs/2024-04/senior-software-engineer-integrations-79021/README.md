Our team loves working at Gladly because of its people, continuous growth opportunities, all in commitment to DEIB, collaboration, and culture.

**About the role**

We are in search of a Senior Software Engineer to join our team, focusing on the development of foundational infrastructure for Gladly's App Platform - helping to turn Gladly from a product into a platform. In this role, you will spearhead the creation of a framework that empowers our customers to seamlessly integrate with external systems and partners. While not directly responsible for individual integrations, you will architect and implement the backbone of our platform, enabling customers to effortlessly develop their own Gladly applications. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, including software engineers, product managers, and designers, you will ensure the scalability, reliability, and extensibility of our API framework. The ideal candidate will possess a deep understanding of RESTful principles, GraphQL and proficiency in programming languages such as Go, and a passion for delivering innovative solutions that drive customer success. Join us in revolutionizing how
businesses connect and integrate with Gladly.

**Some product areas owned by the App Platform Team**

  * API frameworks used by all internal product teams to ship new APIs
  * New mechanisms for third-party developers to integrate with Gladly, such as embedded UIs and actions in external systems
  * Tooling for developers to build and debug their Gladly Apps
  * Tooling and monitoring to ensure API scalability

**What you‚Äôll do**

  * Build! You‚Äôll design, code and maintain innovative, scalable and secure systems. You‚Äôll mix time spent writing code with leading projects.
  * Mentor. You‚Äôll provide technical guidance and mentorship in software engineering best practices to help others grow their careers.
  * Collaborate. You‚Äôll work closely with a small, nimble, cross-functional team of engineers, product managers and designers. You‚Äôll often consult with Gladly‚Äôs developer community to get input and incorporate feedback.
  * Own it. You‚Äôll participate in all aspects of the project lifecycle, from ideation to specification to release and iteration (sometimes in a leadership role).

**You might be a fit if you**

  * Have 5+ years of full-stack engineering experience, with experience designing and shipping scalable distributed systems. Experience with Saas integrations and platforms is a plus.
  * Are relentlessly focused on the customer. You look at everything you create through the lens of how it improves things for our customers, which can be developers and partners.
  * Value collaboration. You know successful software development is a team sport and aren‚Äôt above doing glue work to help the team deliver high quality products.
  * Communicate clearly. You‚Äôre comfortable communicating cross-functionally to describe how various technical approaches might impact the product behavior (and vice versa).
  * Love learning. You are innately curious, whether you are researching new technologies or digging into hard-to-debug issues our customers encounter.
  * (Bonus) Have experience with the technologies we use: Go, Kafka, Postgres, Redis, React, Node, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and ElasticSearch.

Research has shown that individuals from marginalized groups are less likely to apply to jobs where they don't meet 100% of the criteria. Gladly values diversity of experience, so if you believe you have the right skill set, we welcome you to apply - even if you don't check every box in the job description. We're committed to an inclusive workplace and would love to see if you could be the next great addition to our team.
