If youâ€™re like us, you agree that open source software is a wonderful and unique gift that the community of software developers across the world have given to each other. At FOSSA, we want to proliferate its usage with our software supply chain management platform that helps our customers know what licenses, vulnerabilities, and dependencies go into their software as they utilize open source software packages. And we wonâ€™t rest until all companies, big and small, love and feel as comfortable with using open source as we are.

**FOSSA** is a rapidly growing series-B company with a truly distributed team. While our roots are in San Francisco, our growing team has members in several countries across many time zones.
