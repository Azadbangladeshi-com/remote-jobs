#### `ðŸŒŽ CA San Francisco, California, United States`  

**COMPANY**

At 0x, our mission is to _Eliminate the Complexity of Accessing Tokens and Liquidity_. Weâ€™re a mission-driven and diverse team of world-class talent from Coinbase, Google, Meta and other top companies. We are a remote-first and fully distributed company with team members across all continents besides Antarctica. As early pioneers in the space, weâ€™ve made significant technical contributions to various Ethereum standards over the years; _fun fact - our team helped establish the NFT token standard (ERC721)._

In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.

Founded in 2017, 0x created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: the open-source, global backbone for decentralized exchange. Alongside the core protocol, we build and maintain products and service offerings, including Matcha, the search engine for tokens, and 0x API, the endpoint for multi-chain aggregated liquidity. These offerings allow 0x to continue marching towards our vision of building a tokenized world where all value can flow freely at the best prices and with the lowest transaction costs. This way, we can help businesses eliminate the complexity of accessing decentralized markets across all layers of the Web3 exchange stack and have more time to focus on what matters most: their product.

0x currently supports nine major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Base and Celo, and the 0x ecosystem has been rapidly expanding. With integrations across all of the top wallets and apps, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase NFT, Polygon Wallet, Brave, Matcha, dYdX, Zapper, Zerion, and Shapeshift, 0x is fast becoming the trusted standard for all decentralized exchanges.

Weâ€™re a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time. Weâ€™ll consider your application regardless of where you call home.
