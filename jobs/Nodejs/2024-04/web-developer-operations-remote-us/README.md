Description

Grafana Labs is the company behind Grafana, an open-source tool for visualizing and analyzing metrics. It's commonly used for infrastructure and application monitoring, but we've also seen installations to monitor things like beehives, power-plants, or even ambulances. Grafana's mission is to democratize metrics: users can create dashboards that help them get insights into how their applications behave, enabling them to iterate, take action, and improve faster.

Grafana Labs is seeking an operations-focused Web developer.

This role is for you if:

  * You are an engineer that enjoys web development.
  * You are interested in automating and scaling a content-as-code web pipeline.
  * You have experience building components and publishing web pages, and are proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
  * You are an expert or advanced git and CLI user.
  * You are familiar with cloud native technologies, specifically terraform or other IAC tools.
  * You have developed and deployed containerized applications with tools such as Docker and/or Kubernetes (k8s).
  * You have a passion for developing elegant websites with priorities on speed, semantics, and accessibility.

As part of the web team, you will be working with our designers, authors, editors, and a range of stakeholders to help build https://grafana.com.

You can handle ambiguity, adapt to changing circumstances, and remain flexible and focused while working on complex projects.

### Requirements and responsibilities:

  * You are comfortable working in a remote-first company; communication and async work is key. For us, working together means being collaborative, friendly, kind and respectful. 
  * Understanding of cross-browser compatibility and web accessibility standards.
  * Able to pivot on projects as objectives evolve.
  * Develop new and iterate existing components from design mockups - transform prototypes into fully functional web interfaces.
  * Stay one step ahead of translating our design into code by translating UI patterns into reusable components.
  * Participate in code reviews with other developers on the team.
  * Conduct diplomatic stakeholder feedback rounds.

Experience with Hugo, Figma, Alpine.js, Node.js, CI/CD tools such as Drone CI and GitHub actions, Jamstack methodologies, Netlify CMS (now Decap CMS), Docker, Kubernetes (k8s), Jsonnet, and Nginx or similar technologies are a plus.

In the US, the Base compensation range for this role is $105,000 - $126,000. Actual compensation may vary based on level, experience, and skillset as assessed in the interview process.
