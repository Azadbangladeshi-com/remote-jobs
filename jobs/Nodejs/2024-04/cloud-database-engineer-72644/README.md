If youâ€™ve ever given online to a Democrat or progressive organization, chances are youâ€™ve used our powerful online fundraising platform.

We put power in the hands of small-dollar donors and help thousands of groups â€” from presidential candidates to environmental organizations â€” build grassroots movements. We envision a democracy where everyone looking to make progressive people-powered change can easily and effectively deploy their resources, energy, and creativity to shape our country and futures. Each and every one of us, from the political activists to the tech innovators to the customer service pros, is fully committed to our mission.
