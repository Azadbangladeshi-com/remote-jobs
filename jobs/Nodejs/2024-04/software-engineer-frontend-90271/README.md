Our vision is to build the next generation platform to enable easy and fast creation of audio and video content powered by cutting-edge AI. Building a revolutionary way to record, transcribe, edit and mix spoken audio and video comes with a series of unique challenges and requires solving hard and complex problems.

Weâ€™re looking for a frontend software engineer to help us refine and expand our next-generation web-based, collaborative audio and video editing tool. Frontend engineers at Descript work on wide-ranging projects, from the nitty-gritty details of editing interactions, to the critical features of a modern cloud product, to the systems that power real-time collaboration and media playback, to cutting-edge AI integrations. As Descript is a unique product, engineers will often need to find creative solutions to problems in collaboration with product and design.

### What Youâ€™ll Do

  * Develop and refine front-end architecture and best practices to support a fast-moving product engineering team
  * Work alongside AI researchers to build innovative user experiences around the state-of-the-art advancements in AI
  * Iterate on our script-and-scene media editing paradigm to keep users in flow state during the editing process.
  * Push the web browser to its limit, writing high-performance code rivaling native applications

### What You Bring

  * 5+ years of professional software development experience
  * Industry experience in a frontend software engineering role.
  * Proficiency in one or more programming languages and frontend frameworks, especially Typescript/Javascript/React.
  * Pride in delivering high-quality, maintainable, observable, debuggable features
  * Desire to take ownership, and resourcefulness to find answers and simplify problems
  * Experience building or using creative tools (or a passion for learning how to build them!)
  * Self aware of strengths and seeking to constantly learn and improve
  * Strong written and verbal communication

### Nice to Have

  * Experience building creative tools
  * Experience building and optimizing single-page web applications (SPAs)
