Our Staff Software Engineers identify key strategic technical initiatives, deliver significant value to our customers and our business, and set the tone for engineering excellence and culture.

Vantaâ€™s mission is to secure the internet and protect consumer data. We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Our product integrates deeply with the services that present security risk to a company, pulls and analyzes data from those sources, and surfaces potential security threats to our customers in real time with guidance to remediate them.

### About Vanta

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation.

Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.

From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Now more than ever, making security continuousâ€”not just a point-in-time checkâ€” is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trustâ€” all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
