###  **Job Description**

 **What will you do?**

As a QA Lead Engineer at Third Bridge, youâ€™ll be an integral part of the product software engineering team. Collaborating with the wider team, youâ€™ll design and deliver manual and automated testing solutions to support on a number of development projects. Promoting the Quality Assurance mindset and embedding it into the team, youâ€™ll contribute to standards and principals for the whole team to adopt.

Youâ€™ll be working with AWS extensively, conducting API tests, and as a key language of our product engineers is node.js, youâ€™ll be using Playwright for end to end testing. Youâ€™ll be interacting with databases using MySQL and creating queries. The team are in a transition period and our ambition is to shift to a full automation, so your expertise across both manual testing and, increasingly, automation will be used in this role.

Operating in an agile environment youâ€™ll work with the whole team across different disciplines, coaching others where possible. Youâ€™ll grow our technical capability, improve the services we offer to our customers whilst optimising the day to day experience of our software engineers. Leading by example, youâ€™ll take responsibility for a small number of direct reports responsible for their performance and people management.

###  **Qualifications**

 **What will you bring?**

Youâ€™re an experienced Quality Assurance Engineer who doesnâ€™t see themselves as a â€˜testerâ€™ but an integral part of the development lifecycle, embedding the QA mindset into the culture of the team.

You have experience working with:

  * Cloud services, ideally AWS

  * Databases and queries, ideally MySQL

  * Typescript (Playwright)

  * Postman

  * Gherkin

  * Cucumber

  * Jest

You have worked within an agile methodology, and helped coordinate actions using tools such as jira. Youâ€™re a clear communicator, translating business needs and product designs into a clear testing strategy by taking part in architectural reviews. You see every day as an opportunity to learn from others, as well as share best practice and lead by example. You are a coach and mentor, taking a pride in supporting your direct reports to improve and develop their careers, as you set clear targets, give meaningful feedback, and model Third Bridge values and behaviours.
