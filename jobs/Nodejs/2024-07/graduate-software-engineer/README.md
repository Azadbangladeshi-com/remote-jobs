  * Work on a product with strong product-market fit and a backlog of validated customer problems. If you build it, they will use it.

# Our Interview Process

The interview process is designed to simulate the type of work that engineers typically perform on a daily basis. We do not ask deceptive questions, delve into obscure topics, or present academic conundrums. You do not need to dust off your algorithm textbook or grind Leetcode problems to pass our interviews. **We are hiring engineers across the stack, so wherever your expertise lies, we‚Äôll tailor your interview questions to match your strengths.**

The interview process consists of the following steps. The order may vary depending on your availability:

  * Woven Asynchronous Assessment
  * Technical Screening 
    * Code interview (~1 hour)
  * Technical Deep-Dive 
    * Two code interviews (~1 hour each)
    * System design interview (~1 hour)
  * Hiring manager interview (~1 hour)

You will receive information about the interview formats and what to expect beforehand, including preparation tips and sample problems.
