### Cribl  
#### `ðŸŒŽ USA - Remote`  

**Why You'll Love This Role**

Are you excited about enabling customers to find, analyze, and visualize their operational data, no matter where it lives, regardless of format or storage medium? Cribl Inc is looking for a front-end focused Principal Engineer to drive and mentor a remote-first, diverse, inclusive, cross-functional team of software developers focused on the Cribl Searchâ€™s front end, as we execute on our mission to unlock the value of all observability data. Cribl Search flips observability on its head by distributing queries to where your data already lives and aggregating the results - no more expensive data replication, centralized aggregation, megaIOPS+petabyte storage, or kilocore+terabyte hosts required to see whatâ€™s going on in your deployed environments. Want to find specific events, trace an execution, identify a threat, or graph metric trends from (ex.) data stored in EBS volumes, Cribl Edge nodes, S3 buckets, Azure blob stores, containers, RDBMSes, data lakes, or even a custom datastore? How
about being able to do that from a single pane, regardless of heterogeneous storage / location / hosting / on-disk format? Thatâ€™s what Cribl Search enables, and we think itâ€™s a game-changer for helping Cribl become the data engine for IT and security.

As a Principal Engineer, you will work closely with a group of highly-skilled engineers to shape the future of our front-end development. You will play a central role in designing and developing user interfaces and visualizations that are scalable, robust, and user-friendly. This role is ideal for someone who is passionate about building high-performance web applications and enjoys working in a dynamic, collaborative environment.

On top of it all, you will have fun! Cribl strives to be a great place to work for everyone.
