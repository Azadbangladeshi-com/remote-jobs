Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About MetaMask**  

Weâ€™re building for a future where the internet and world economy empowers people through interactions based on consent, privacy, and free association, where both communities and individuals flourish. To accomplish that, weâ€™re working hard to make web3 accessible for everyone.

MetaMask is both a crypto wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web. Our tools help people create communities, play video games, access financial services, make payments, invest in assets, protect against economic turmoil, and more. Our browser extension and mobile platforms meet the needs of millions of users and developers across the world.

#### **The MetaMask Wallet API Platform Team**

Empowering developers to deliver great decentralized user experiences is at the heart of MetaMaskâ€™s purpose. From the beginning, we have done so by providing the web with an API that allows any developer to turn their site or web-app into a decentralized app connected to the blockchain.

Currently the MetaMask Wallet API allows dApps to do things like: propose transactions to users, access the address of the users current account, use keys in MetaMask to help users encrypt and decrypt messages, propose to users that they sign specific messages, access the connected node/provider and call all methods on the Ethereum RPC API, and to propose that users add and switch to a specific network. We enhance and expand this list of capabilities and build tools to help other teams build new capabilities themselves.  
  
To get a fuller picture of the current API, you can check out our documentation https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/concepts/wallet-api/

By improving and expanding this API, we can make entirely new types of decentralized user experiences possible. There is also much work to do to make this API accessible for the many new developers joining our space.

We are hiring engineers to join our Wallet API Platform team and help us build the platform on which the worldâ€™s most exciting dapps will be built.

**What youâ€™ll do**  

  * Build and maintain Wallet API infrastructure and tooling. 
  * Help to manage and govern a pipeline of proposed new APIs.
  * Work with partners and standards bodies across the Web3 ecosystem to shape wallet API standards.

**Would be great if you brought this to the role**

We are looking for a senior software engineer who is:

  * Growth-minded and collaborative, and who thrives in an environment with some ambiguity, autonomy, and the freedom to experiment.
  * Proficient and thoughtful with asynchronous and synchronous communication and with giving and receiving feedback
  * Supportive of their teamâ€™s collective performance and growth
  * Successfully working in a fully remote environment, individually and within a team
  * Respectful, patient, and empathic in every interaction and relationship with their coworkers and the community
  * Able to work towards technical clarity amidst competing viewpoints
  * Enthusiastic and unwavering on shipping high-quality code
  * Interested in working with partners across the Web3 ecosystem on shared Wallet API standards

The Wallet API Platform team carries an important mission to craft and maintain the best API for developers so that MetaMask can continue to grow with the wider Web3 ecosystem.  
  
The senior software engineer role is a critical part of this team. They would be responsible for creating and managing the API that all MetaMask developers are using. As web3 evolves, the API needs to evolve with the larger ecosystem. This requires a team of highly dynamic and agile software engineers to serve MetaMaskâ€™s developer community.

Because of the complexity and nascency of web3, most of our API have a very long lifecycle after being made publicly available. The engineer who takes on this role will be the guardian of a high-quality API with a long lifecycle in a rapidly evolving ecosystem. This engineer must have a long-term mindset when planning and designing the API as well as introducing any new major change.

  * 2 years of experience working on a team of at least 3 other engineers with a strong focus on peer reviews

  * 2 years of experience managing an existing codebase
  * 1 year of experience owning and managing unit, integration, end-to-end tests, and/or testing frameworks/strategies
  * 1 year of experience with JSON-RPC, Swagger, and/or OpenAPI

Bonus points:

  * Mobile development experience
  * Security engineering
  * Involvement in EIP authoring or review processes
  * Browser APIs
