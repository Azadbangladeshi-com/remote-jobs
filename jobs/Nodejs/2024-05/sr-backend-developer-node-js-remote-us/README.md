### **Company Description**

 **WE EMBRACE A TALENT-LED CULTURE**

 **Our work is driven by our teamâ€™s desire to be pioneers.**

 **In 2009, we created Robots & Pencils with the then-contrarian view that mobile would be more transformative than the Internet. Turns out we were right.**

 **Today, our thinking is rooted in the belief that, in the age of unprecedented technology acceleration, maintaining a competitive advantage requires new strategies and a focus on innovation.**

 **Our approach has been to create a company designed to follow the talent, allowing us to amass an unfair share of hyper-skilled people who call Robots & Pencils home. A team of people who not only develop innovative solutions to transform businesses, but also create products that have been previously inconceivable.**

 **Our Core Values:**

  *  **Strong Work Ethic**
  *  **Top Drawer**
  *  **Always Learning**
  *  **Heart**
  *  **Discipline**
  *  **Efficacy**
  *  **Together**

 **Robots & Pencils Offers:**

 **We do this in many ways, by offering:**

  *  **An attractive compensation package**

  *  **A fast paced environment with a culture that embraces change, and working together to find a far better way**

  *  **High quality talent: we hire only the best talent we can find. You do remarkable things and solve tough problems where many others have failed before.**
  *  **Excellent benefits Medical, Dental, Vision etc. (this routinely gets reviewed each year for enhancements)**

  *  **Paid stat/federal holidays, vacation and sick days**

  *  **Flexible paid stat/federal holidays (because we care about what you care about and want to celebrate our culturally diverse team!)**

  *  **R &P branded swag**

  *  **Parental & adoption leave top up / salary continuance**

  *  **401K/RRSP matching**

**But we also know a job isnâ€™t just defined by the above, so we pride ourselves in being a company that also offers:**

  *  **A #FollowTheTalent mentality -- meaning you can be located anywhere in North America and work remotely. (We have 10+ years of experience building virtual working environments #WeKnowWhatWereDoing)**

  *  **A dynamic, fast-paced environment where weâ€™re constantly #alwayslearning.**

  *  **And lastly, a team that cares about you and wants to drive the talent experience. How do we do this? Over the years weâ€™ve hosted comedian shows, had holiday parties, happy hours, brunches with the CEO, surprise coffee runs for the team, health & wellness events and prizes, trivia nights, surprise dinners for R&P team members and their family and so much more! (And yes, weâ€™ve prioritized a way to do these things in a virtual setting and not just in person - thank you Zoom!)**
