**About the team**

Our Dev Experience team is building tools and processes that help our engineers get coding and deployment done with the minimum amount of fuss whilst ticking the safety, regulatory and compliance boxes we need.

We are committed to a 100% Infrastructure-as-Code approach to infrastructure builds using Terraform and currently deploy to AWS. We also follow the GitOps model of application deployment and use tools such as ArgoCD, Helm and Crossplane to facilitate this approach.

As part of the wider Cloud Infrastructure team, you will work closely with other cloud engineers to make this model for deploying and managing services usable for Tide. Youâ€™ll also work closely with our Information Security team to ensure we meet and exceed our regulatory obligations.

  * Building systems and integrations to make things better in the following areas:
    * Continuous Integration and deployment pipelines
    * Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
    * Environment provisioning for development and testing
    * Service catalogue
  * Finding problem areas in Tideâ€™s CI/CD pipelines and making them faster
  * Automating operational work to ensure Tideâ€™s systems run smoothly and without human intervention wherever possible
  * Working with technical teams and agile coaches to understand bottlenecks in our engineering processes and find technical solutions

**What we are looking for**

  * You have experience working in agile environments
  * You are a self starter who is comfortable reading and understanding documentation, getting stuck into a problem and turning out a quick prototype 
  * You are able to decompose big problems into solvable chunks, and deliver full solutions incrementally 
  * You have technical knowledge and experience with API-based products
  * You are comfortable working in a fast-moving company where priorities will change and processes may need to be created from scratch

**Our Tech Stack** _(You donâ€™t have to excel in all, but willing to learn them):_

  * Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)
  * Git and GitHub Actions
  * Terraform
