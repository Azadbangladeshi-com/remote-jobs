Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.

Working with Consensys puts you at the **forefront of an evolving paradigm** , transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and weâ€™re far from reaching our full potential. Youâ€™ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

Youâ€™ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects â€” challenging you to stay at the **top of your game**. Youâ€™ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the **edge of our ecosystem**. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

**About Metamask**

We aspire to build a diverse engineering team, inclusive to people from all backgrounds and demographics. It is also of great importance to us that working at MetaMask is an experience that catalyzes career growth and learning.

**What youâ€™ll do**

This Frontend Engineer will contribute to MetaMaskâ€™s curated portfolio and asset views and NFT experiences. We are looking for creative, talented and passionate individuals who are willing to dive deep into the complexity and challenges of blockchain and web3 and help deliver best-in-class curated experiences to our users across our multiple platforms (Portfolio Dapp, browser Extension and Mobile app). As a Frontend Engineer, you will help unify, enhance and transform our portfolio, assets, and NFT experiences across platforms.
