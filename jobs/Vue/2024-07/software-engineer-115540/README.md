# [Software Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-115540)  
### AJ Bell  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote,Hybrid - WFH / Bristol, United Kingdom`  

### **Job Description**

The Touch team is developing a next generation investment platform. We want to use technology to improve the way consumers access financial advice and manage their investments. The majority of existing platforms are still reliant on software and processes that arenâ€™t capable of supporting todayâ€™s technology, so we started from scratch, developing a modern platform that is as efficient as possible. We're building a mobile first investment app that lets advisers manage their clients' investments entirely through their Smartphone.

**What you'll be doing:**

  * Engage in the full software development lifecycle: requirements gathering with stakeholders, working as a team to build and test features, managing deployment and supporting the service in production. 
  * Work as part of a distributed team made up of self-motivated and collaborative individuals. Much of our communication is remote and async so good communication skills are key. 
  * Iteratively make improvements to a new product while aligning to our mutually agreed design and architectural principles. 
  * Always looking for ways we can improve our product, processes and practices. We donâ€™t like friction and waste. 
  * Automated testing, continuous integration and continuous deployment. We are huge proponents of automation. 
  * Working outside of your specialism when needed. While all our team members have a specialism, we donâ€™t let that restrain us. Our engineers jump in to help get things done even in technologies out of their core competency. 

**What you'll already have:**

  * Excellent programming and problem solving skills 
  * Understanding of relevant software design patterns and paradigms, such as OOAD, DDD, MVC, microservices, containers/orchestration or event-driven architecture 
  * Experience in creating performant, scalable, secure and well tested code. 
  * You take ownership of tasks and problems, clearing roadblocks and pulling in other people to help when needed. 

**Our tools and technologies:**

The below are all things that we are either currently using or have found to be a useful foundation when joining our team. Prior knowledge of them is not essential but would be beneficial to the role:

  * Go (we can offer training for experienced engineers who havenâ€™t used Go before) 
  * gRPC/proto 
  * PostgreSQL 
  * The HashiCorp stack, such as Nomad, Terraform and Vault 
  * Docker 

**Other technologies we use include:**

  * TypeScript and Vue 
  * Dart and Flutter
