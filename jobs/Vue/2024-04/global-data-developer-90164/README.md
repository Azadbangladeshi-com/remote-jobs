### **Description**

The Global Business Technology (GBT) department is essential to meet the Firm's strategic vision. We help to align technology services with the Firm's objectives. This alignment is essential for providing excellent service and value to the firm and its stakeholders. The Firmwide technology function mirrors the firm's Verein structure, balancing the delivery of standardized global services enabled by GBT with tailored local solutions offered by local technology teams. This approach reflects the firm‚Äôs strategy of building an integrated global law firm, while also recognizing the unique needs of individual local firms. Since its establishment in 2016, GBT has become an integral component of the firm‚Äôs support infrastructure, relied upon by Verein Members and Affiliates (VMAs). The team, now spanning over 50 members across 12 countries, has seen significant development with its adoption of best practices across various disciplines such as project management, IT service management, and
technology operations, highlighted by the introduction of the Central Technology Support (CTS) service.

GBT's role and mission have adapted to support the firm's strategic decisions, such as enabling an integrated firm ethos, maintaining a single brand promise, and supporting growth.

This has led to the creation of systems that aggregate data for client and people management and support cross-border incentive programs. Global Business Technology is shaped by industry best practices and is designed to optimize technology delivery within the firm's Federated IT model. The team is structured around four core groups: Global Technology Programs, Global Data &amp Application Services, Global Technology Services, and Global Commercial Services. Each group is responsible for specific areas
of technology and business, ensuring effective collaboration and clear accountability. This structure enables GBT to focus on delivering on its promise of Service Excellence.
