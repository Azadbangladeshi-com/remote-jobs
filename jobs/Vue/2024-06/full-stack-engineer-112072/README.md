# [Full Stack Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/full-stack-engineer-112072)  
### Healthengine  
#### `ðŸŒŽ Remote,Perth, Australia`  

### **Job Description**

This is your opportunity to join our team of forward-thinking, change-making individuals. Operating at the intersection of health and tech, you'll help us shape the future of healthcare.

**Our Mission**

Healthengineâ€™s mission is to improve access to healthcare by helping Australians find and connect with all primary care providers. We strive to achieve this through Australiaâ€™s leading healthcare marketplace, bringing together over 4 million active Australians, and more than 10 thousand practitioners that are powered by our technology - and growing.

Weâ€™re all patients, right? So, itâ€™s easy to get behind a mission that seeks to improve the healthcare experience for all Australians.

**The gig**

Healthengineâ€™ering is made up of squads, typically containing about 4-8 engineers, a product manager, and a designer; that deliver the major components of the Healthengine ecosystem. Several squads are aligned with business verticals, utilising the entire web stack to deliver products, and some are more specifically focused on their area of technology such as our SRE, Mobile, and Integrations squads.

As our newest engineer, we will work together to understand your strengths and goals to align you with the right engineering squad to both deliver great products and experiences for our users but also be in the best position to grow as an engineer, team member, and mentor (no matter how junior or senior you are, we all have something to teach and something to learn).

(Some of) the responsibilities:

  * Contribute to your squadâ€™s goals, delivering high-quality and high-performing experiences to hundreds of thousands of users
  * Collaborate with others, including engineers, designers, product managers and senior leaders to come up with innovative and delight-filled solutions
  * Work across the entire engineering organisation on guild initiatives, innovation projects, or one of the learning groups 
  * Identify and implement ideas that will increase developer velocity and create better user experiences
  * Support the learning and development of others by documenting, presenting and sharing your expertise with others 

**About you**

You're the kind of person who takes accountability in a fast-paced, autonomous and flexible environment. Fast may be your default (like us!) but you never, ever compromise on whatâ€™s important, willing to take a steady, more informed approach when it comes to maintaining the trust of our team and customers. You handle change like a pro, and continuous improvement is a way of life. You are not afraid to speak up and share your thoughts respectfully, with the intention of making positive change. You take initiative and drive your own learning journey without waiting for someone to point you in the right direction. And ultimately, you care: about people, health and innovation.

Experience youâ€™ll bring:

  * 2+ years in a similar role 
  * Experience with at least one JavaScript framework (React/Angular/Vue)
  * Good understanding of PHP (or strong experience in a similar language)
  * Good understanding of Postgres (or other relational databases)
  * Experience working with Agile development methodologies (Kanban/Scrum)

 **Additional Information**

Healthengine is where youâ€™ll be your best self. Youâ€™ll collaborate with smart, interesting people who will challenge you to be better. You will learn a lot and grow even more. Healthengine is the ideal workplace to bring ideas, make change and leave a lasting impact on your team and the industry.

In addition to an array of growth opportunities, we also offer:
