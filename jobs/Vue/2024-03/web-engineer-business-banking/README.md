 **About us:**

We’re here to make money work for everyone and we're doing things differently. For too long, banking has been obtuse, complex and opaque.

We want to change that and build a bank with everyone, for everyone. Our amazing community suggests features, test the app and give us constant feedback so we can build something everyone loves.

We're focused on solving problems, rather than selling financial products. We want to make the world a better place and change people's lives through Monzo.

 **We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive.**

Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone. You can read more in our 2022 Diversity and Inclusion Report **** and 2022 Gender Pay Gap Report.

 **About our Engineering Teams:**

We have around 300 engineers out of roughly 2,500 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you’ll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.

We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog **** is a good place to learn even more about what we do!

 **What you’ll be working on:**

We’re looking for a Web Engineer to help us grow the Monzo Business Banking web platform. Our vision is to become the ‘financial control centre’ for business customers by providing the features and services that businesses need. We want to fit seamlessly with the tools our customers use and provide a delightful banking experience across all the devices they use day-to-day.

As a part of our Business Banking team, you’ll be working alongside web, backend and mobile engineers, product managers, user researchers and designers to build the features that let our customers make the most of their Business account. You’ll be part of a team that’s helping to define how we make the most of the web at Monzo. This could involve building new web applications, using new libraries or setting the standard for how we showcase our products on the web. You’ll also work collaboratively with web engineers across the company to set standards and best practices.

Our Business Banking web platform is written in modern functional JavaScript using React/Next.js, and you'll help to define what kind of technology we use. You’ll also have the opportunity to improve the web standards and guidance that we use across Monzo.

 **Every day you’ll be:**

  * Working closely with designers to iterate and improve on the user experience (UX) of the web banking platform, building accessible and intuitive interfaces.
  * Actively contributing to every stage in the product development lifecycle within your team, and owning the development of new features from start to finish.
  * Working closely with our backend engineers to design APIs to support new frontend features.
  * Collaborating with other web engineers to add brand-new features to the Business Banking web platform.

 **You should apply if:**

  * You love building products in cross disciplinary teams using an iterative approach, driven by user feedback and data insight.
  * You care deeply about providing a great user experience for our users.
  * You have an interest in building performant web experiences and designing/building UI that makes it easy for users to accomplish what they need.
  * You enjoy working in a large front-end codebase with many stakeholders.
  * You understand the importance of prioritisation in your work to ensure a good balance between development velocity and code quality.
  * You have developed modern component-oriented JavaScript applications using frameworks and libraries (e.g React, Vue, Angular, Flow/Typescript, Webpack etc).
  * You are a keen learner and love sharing your knowledge with others.

 **The Interview Process:**

Our interview process involves three main stages:

  1. Recruiter Call
  2. Initial Call 
  3. Technical Interview
  4. Final interview including a system design and a behavioural interview 

Our average process takes around 3-4 weeks but we will always work around your availability.

You will have the chance to speak to our recruitment team at various points during your process but if you do have any specific questions or want to talk through reasonable adjustments ahead of or during application please us at any point on tech-hiring@monzo.com
