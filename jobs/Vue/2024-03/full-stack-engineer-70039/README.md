Description

## **About Clockwise**

https://www.getclockwise.com/

Clockwise is AI scheduling and calendar automation that coordinates the way you, your team, and your company prefer to work.

Every day, based on the preferences you set, Clockwise tests out millions of potential calendar arrangements across your company to determine what choices best balance time to meet, time for deep work, and whatever else you need. The result is a schedule that reacts dynamically to changing calendars to ensure your work day works for you, and a superhuman ability to schedule the impossible. It‚Äôs like an executive assistant for your entire team.

Time is a company‚Äôs greatest shared resource. Less time spent on calendar management means more time for fostering creativity, exploring new ideas, and driving innovation. Clockwise helps teams make time for the things that matter most and share their time with each other wisely. And with real-time analytics and team-level calendar preferences, companies get insight into bandwidth and mutual availability to maximize productivity and enhance meeting culture. The result? Healthier work-life integration, less burnout, and faster achievement on goals.

We can‚Äôt fix our schedules on our own. But we can build the solution together. Join us, and let‚Äôs rework the workday.

We're proud to have the backing of Coatue, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Bain Capital Ventures and other preeminent investors. Our team has decades of experience from places like Twitter, Asana, Salesforce, Dropbox, Meta, Stripe and Google. Join us to help the world make time for what matters.
