**Headquarters:**  
**URL:** https://csgoempire.com/roulette

**CSGOEmpire is looking for hungry, front-end developers that can think out of the box - developers that never back down from a challenge.  
**  

Weâ€™re looking for the shadowy anonymous types that:

  * Are enthusiastic about coding, problem-solving, and continuous improvement;
  * Try to almost obsessively optimize and hack everything they come across;
  * Are fully at home in the gaming and online gambling space, particularly with the CS scene

Weâ€™re not the place for vanilla corporate types that only care about clocking in and out. We want people that are truly special and truly driven to grow.  
  

Right now, weâ€™re looking for fully remote front-end developers to help fulfil our ambitious plans of building multiple, massive projects at once. This is a new opening to help manage our growing workload.  
  

**Candidates with a minimum of 3 years xp with the following are welcome:  
**  

**Tech**

  * Vue.js, HTML, and Tailwind CSS _(this is a must!)_
  * Jest
  * Big plus: Microservices, Websockets, Node.js

**Tools and services**

  * Docker
  * Jira
  * Git (Gitlab)

**Here are some of the areas youâ€™ll be contributing to:**

  * Collaborating closely with the senior developers and designers to develop seamless UI/UX features
  * Crushing bugs in a timely manner
  * Over time, crafting your own path to becoming a senior engineer

We want to go big, and we need the right people on board â€” and you can be one of them.  
  

**We exist as the antidote to scammers within the casino industry.  
**  

CSGOEmpire creates products that are fun to use, provide great value for players, and most importantly, are honest, transparent, and provide a fair experience.  
  

But our mission isnâ€™t easy. And many stand in our way.  
  

The scene is filled with scammers and exploiters looking to lie and cheat their way to big paydays. Empire has stood in their way many times, from the CSGODiamonds scandal back in 2018 to the CSGORoll files in 2023. Stopping scammers is a strong part of our identity â€” it's something we deeply believe in and think is crucial for the safety and growth of the industry.  
  

Joining us is a commitment - a commitment to a future where people can gamble safely, fairly, and openly, with an operator that always pays out wins and with games that can be verified to be provably fair.  
  

Joining us means standing against those that look to cheat and steal from our customers and our community. If youâ€™re ready to commit, if youâ€™re ready to take a stand, then a career with us might be your next big move.  
  

Weâ€™re looking for people that have that dawg in them!  
  

**Your Upside  
**  

Joining us at CSGOEmpire means that youâ€™re one of the best in your field. It means that you possess a special set of skills that no one else has. And these skills are indispensable in our ongoing fight for fairness and transparency in the casino industry.  
  

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s in it for you:

  * **Competitive compensation:** We're offering $60k per year for this role.
  * **A mission like no other:** Make the industry a better place, make a lot of money, create compelling products, and fight evil.
  * **Fully remote:** Work from anywhere, just sync with Central European time by 3-4 hours _(the locations mentioned in some of our ads are used for admin purposes only)_
  * **Limited meetings:** We keep meetings to a minimum and communicate almost entirely via Discord, Slack and Jira.
  * **No micromanagement** : We hire the best so we trust them to deliver results.
  * **Flexible schedule:** You set your schedule, just ensure consistent availability during the Monday-Friday, 9 to 5 Central European time window.
  * **Unlimited room for growth:** Those that can surpass expectations can have a place on our team forever. And theyâ€™ll be greatly rewarded.
  * **Consultancy-based contract:** We offer straightforward contracts focused purely on financial remuneration. No additional frills â€“ just direct, competitive cash compensation.
  * **Professional development:** We'll match 50% of your expenses on professional development courses, up to $1,000 annually.
  * **Laptop upgrade grant:** After 3 years with us, receive up to $2,000 for a new laptop or PC, redeemable every 3 years.

**  
How We Hire**

We have a merit-based recruitment process because we want to hire the best people. So University degrees arenâ€™t a requirement for any role, and we have no such thing as a diversity quota.  
  

Your application will be considered holistically. For example, someone with a marketing degree applying for an influencer management role but no industry contacts would not be chosen over a high school dropout that has a deep network and a history of structuring great deals.  
  

On the other hand, a degree could be a big plus for a research assistant application as it proves your ability to persevere and focus on high-level tasks. Itâ€™s all about context.  
  

So if you think youâ€™re the best, it doesnâ€™t matter who you are or where you come from â€” introduce yourself.  
  

After submitting an initial application, hereâ€™s the usual process for shortlisted candidates:

  1. Let your skills shine through a technical assessment
  2. Join us for a 45 min. interview/Q+A with 2 Senior Devs from our team
  3. Meet our CTO in a final 20 min. chat
