Description

Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.

 **The Community You Will Join:**

Payments is key for any healthy marketplace, and is just as central to our product at Airbnb. The Payments org at Airbnb is responsible for everything related to settling money in Airbnbâ€™s global marketplace. We build technology that powers Airbnbâ€™s massive daily transaction volume to collect payments from guests, distribute payouts to hosts and everything in between. Our goal is to make the Payment experience on Airbnb as delightful, magical, intuitive, and easy as possible.

Within Payments, the Compliance Experience team focuses on building best in class product experiences for Airbnb hosts, such that even the most rigorous compliance process is delightful.

The APIs, UIs, workflows and tools that you develop will implement critical controls for identification (KYC), authentication (SCA) and detection of financial crime (Sanctions/AML) while providing an intuitive and polished user experience for Airbnbâ€™s global host community.

As a senior frontend engineer, youâ€™ll also be responsible for contributing to the broader technical vision and building alignment within engineering and cross-functional teams - all while delivering a solution that is flexible, always available, efficient, and scales with the needs of the business.

  * Proficiency in one or more back-end server languages (Java/Ruby/Go/C++/etc.)
  * Strong understanding of how complex backend logic can be expressed cleanly in the UX and architectural patterns of a high-scale web and data applications
  * Rigorous attention to detail - our products have to work correctly to keep Airbnb and our users safe
  * Be future looking - we might be focused on immediate regulations, but need to build for the long term
