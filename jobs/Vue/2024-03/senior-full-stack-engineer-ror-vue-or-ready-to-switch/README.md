We are a small team of 4 people who decided to start our own project - build a Shopify app. We chose a relatively small niche to compete in, so we could test whether we had what it takes to succeed. About a year later we dominated that niche! We are now serving more than 4000 merchants!During that time, all of us have gone through impressive personal growth. We learned a lot. We got confidence.Now we are ready to get into one of the biggest niches in the market. And eventually we will dominate it too. It will take a few years, but we know we can do it! We can do it only with your help.

What will you do?**

  * Maintain our existing app and help build a new one.
  * Create entire big modules from scratch.
  * Tackle lots of interesting challenges.
  * Help us reach 100k merchants!

Who are you?**

  * A damn good full stack developer (senior level).
