You will balance short and long-term efforts from a feature perspective and work on backend machine learning enterprise feature challenges. With the team, you will be building the backbone of our ML efforts that solve the challenges of today and tomorrow for our customers building in the journey of ML.

###  Some examples:

  * MLOps features in GitLab DevSecops Platform 
  * GitLab Model Registry 

#### **What you will do**

  * Play a key role in the design, implementation, building and integration of product features;
  * Solve technical backend machine learning problems of high scope and complexity;
  * Test, deploy, maintain, and improve ML system solution features that aid with registry, deployments, inference of models;

####  **About the team**

Today, data scientists piece together data, tooling, and frameworks to get bespoke data science workloads running and producing business value. Data scientists then hand off models to engineering teams to attempt to deploy them to production. These teams speak different languages, use different tools, and have completely different workflows. This makes it very difficult to deploy data science workloads to production, increasing time to value and costs. One of our primary goals for our ModelOps stage is to reduce the complexities of data science workloads and integrate these workloads to easily be managed and developed within GitLab.

####  **How GitLab will support you**

  * All remote, asynchronous work environment
  * Unlimited PTO (paid time off)
  * GitLab is home to many dedicated Team Member Resource Groups
  * Benefits to manage your health, wealth, and well-being regardless of location
