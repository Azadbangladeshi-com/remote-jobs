# [Software Engineer I](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-i-58355)  
### Civis Analytics  
#### `ðŸ’° 184000.0`  

At Civis Analytics, we bring objective, data-driven truth to organizational decision-makingâ€”from the boardroom to the worldâ€™s largest progressive social causes.

This mission isnâ€™t an aspiration: itâ€™s something we see realized every day, and it brings purpose to everything weâ€™re working on.

We combine a sophisticated SaaS product with our specialized data science consultancy to empower tens of thousands of active users to make millions of data-driven decisions every month. From joining disparate data sources and automating reporting, to building more elaborate models of targeted audiences and optimizing messages for them, organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the City of Boston, and iHeart Radio trust Civisâ€™s technology to make their most critical decisions.

Core to our product and consulting offerings is Civis Platform, which makes it easy to import, manage, transform, analyze, and report on data with integrated open source tools. Our customers love Civis Platform because it empowers them to focus on finding data-driven answers to their most critical questionsâ€”in other words, we empower them to run their business, rather than running a tech stack.

###  **What we are looking for**

Software Engineers are responsible for building the backbone of Civis Analytics -- the software products that our customers use to solve their hardest business problems.

We trust engineers from all over our team to pick the right architecture, library, or framework for the job at hand. They help make decisions about new products in cross-functional design sprints and take quarterly hack weeks to try out new ideas and new technologies. Civis engineers push code to production on their second day and quickly ramp up on projects of increasing responsibility.

We want to never stop learning. Everyone has a mentor from day one and tracks their personal development alongside their technical deliverables. We staff projects based on what people will learn, not just who knows it best today.
