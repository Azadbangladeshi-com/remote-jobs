Description

**Vonage Engineering Mission:**

Vonage is the emerging leader in the $100B+ cloud communications platform (CPaaS) market. Customers like Airbnb, Viber, Whatsapp, Snapchat, and many others depend on our APIs and SDKs to connect with their customers all over the world. As businesses continue to shift to a real-time, customer-centric communications model, we are experiencing a time of impressive growth.

Vonage was also recently acquired by Ericson, and is now forging ahead to create a brand new market around Network APIs, a market poised to be worth $15B+ by 2030, and Vonage and Ericson together are blazing a path to capturing the vast majority of that new market and is already far far ahead of the competition. The Ericson investment in Vonage has further boosted our growth and need for key talents.

**Why this role matters**

The Dashboard is the website our customers use to sign up, manage their account and their API settings. It is responsible for a sizeable chunk of the API group revenue, and the growth of our customers as they adopt our products. It also includes the developer documentation, which is a key area of acquisition, and a major touch point for every single customer, large and small use during their lifecycle.

As a Dashboard developer, you will be a key component in delivering an outstanding customer experience, delivering a stable and resilient architecture, and helping drive up the company revenue. You will also be part of a Dev Ops culture, challenging you to go beyond just code, and also consider how our applications are deployed, scale and behave under scale.

Situated at the intersection of all the product teams internally, itâ€™s a very diverse team and it gives a sneak peek into all the Vonage API products and services - it couldnâ€™t be a better place to work!

  * Help promote a maintainable well designed Java, JavaScript and Typescript codebase and look for ways to further improve our applicationsâ€™ internal design, thinking about build, deployment, object-oriented design, automated testing, error handling, logging, monitoring, etc

**What we value**

  * Being disruptive. Getting things done. With smart people. Enjoying knowing that the work we do is having a global impact by enabling never before imagined communications.
  * We have big goals, and we want the people who join us to be self-confident, focused on customers and delivery, and who are structured and committed in their approach. We iterate quickly, we fail fast, we take smart chances. We value those who will help us continue this spirit
  * Values matter at Vonage. We are on a mission to bring value for consumers and enterprises through global cloud based communications.

  * We believe in integrity. Both personally and professionally. We believe in empowering our employees and are actively seeking entrepreneurs in training who want to help build something larger.
  * We have gotten to this point by being committed, passionate, and focused on getting things done. We need more people like us. If this appeals to you then we encourage you to apply.
