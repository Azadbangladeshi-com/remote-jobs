### Reliable Robotics  
#### `ðŸ’° 260500.0` `ðŸŒŽ United States`  
We're building safety-enhancing technology for aviation that will save lives. Automated aviation systems will enable a future where air transportation is safer, more convenient and fundamentally transformative to the way goods â€” and eventually people â€” move around the planet. We are a team of mission-driven engineers with experience across aerospace, robotics and self-driving cars working to make this future a reality.  
As a Displays Software Engineer at Reliable Robotics, you will be a part of the remote piloting software team. This team is responsible for building the pilot-facing application software that is used to command the aircraft's advanced automation systems â€” both onboard, and remotely. You will join a team of interdisciplinary and mission-driven engineers with experience across aerospace, robotics, and self-driving vehicles.  
Responsibilities  
In your role as a Displays Software Engineer, your primary focus will be designing, architecting, and building a variety of real-time user interface applications for controlling our automated aircraft systems. These can range from browser-based applications to real-time embedded UIs on aviation-grade hardware. All of these applications will support our work to build a fully certified system in multiple ways: they will serve as a platform for rapidly prototyping different workflows and designs; they will be directly used in our ongoing experimental test flight programs; and they will ultimately serve as a reference implementation for our certified displays and controls. You will have ownership over the entire lifecycle of these applications and will work with software engineers and designers within the team, as well as systems engineers and pilots to build systems that are safe, user-centered, and certifiable.

### Basic Success Criteria

  * 3+ years of experience developing user-facing software for high-performance or mission-critical applications
  * Fluent with C/C++ and/or Javascript
  * Strong technical, organizational, problem-solving, and root-cause investigation skills
  * Excellent documentation and collaboration skills
  

### Preferred Success Criteria

  * 3+ years of experience with core browser technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
  * 3+ years C or C++ experience
  * Expertise developing reusable features using Web Components or JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, Lit, etc
  * Thorough understanding of computer architecture, operating systems and networking
  * Expertise developing user-facing software requirements and following graphical specifications
  * Familiarity with aviation instrumentation design
  * Proficiency with design applications such as Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, etc
  * Familiarity with human-in-the-loop testing and certification campaigns
  * Commercial pilot license
  * Demonstrated ability to work in a self-directed manner in a fast-paced environment
