At PathAI, you'll work with a diverse and talented team of people, who are dedicated to solving complex problems and making a huge impact.

### Where You Fit

We're looking for skilled and motivated functional testers with some automation experience to help keep our quality and reliability bar high. This position focuses on understanding applications and creating the necessary test cases, being able to document and run the cases while looking for opportunities to collaborate with our SDET members to automate tests. Our functional testers are part of the SDET group, which is responsible for manual and automated testing of PathAI products. They work closely with software developers and quality engineers. Functional testers will be attached to specific projects and initiatives, as close to the start of these efforts as possible. Our functional testers will also collaborate across groups to find common patterns and opportunities for re-use and collaboration. Day to day we see our functional testers working besides the teams they are assigned to, participating in planning and design, understanding the application and its requirements and then
planning and writing out test cases. During release cycles functional testers will lead and coordinate the manual test execution effort, work with the engineering and product teams to evaluate bugs, and build documentation for our quality partners. _**This is a 6 month contract position. There will be an opportunity to renew and extend the contract with good performance in the role.**_

PathAI products are cloud software running in Amazon AWS, using Django and written primarily in Python. Our front-ends use Vue.js and TypeScript, and our end-to-end testing framework is written in Python using Playwright.

  * Be part of taking our testing strategy to the next level. Building on a solid base to evolve the PathAI testing strategy, documentation and processes to improve the overall quality of our platform. 
  * Work with our engineering teams to implement current best practices from the testing world based on our strict quality requirements. 
  * Work with our engineering teams to define the desired level of test and quality, creating test plans and automating them.

### What You Bring
