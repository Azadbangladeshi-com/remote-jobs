 **This role will require the candidate to time shift** and work from 4pm to 1am IST to overlap with our North American team.

At Moonvalley, our product development process will be a bit non-standard and consist of small autonomous teams working to ship great features and experiences. Here is a good primer.

In our team, we approach our work with the dedication similar to Olympic athletes. Anticipate occasional late nights and weekends dedicated to our mission. We understand this level of commitment may not suit everyone, and we openly communicate this expectation.

If you're motivated by deeply technical problems, a seemingly never-ending uphill battle and the opportunity to build (and own) a generational technology company, we can give you what you're looking for.

This is a fully remote position with Moonvalley, and we welcome candidates from anywhere. We meet a few times every quarter, usually in a center-point between NA and India (like Dubai).

If you're excited about the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI technology and help shape the future of sales, we encourage you to apply. We look forward to hearing from you!
