### What youâ€™ll do:

  * Solve interesting problems with code.
  * Build new features for internal and external users, and refactor existing ones to make them better.
  * Work with a wide range of systems, processes, and technologies to solve problems in sustainable ways. Sometimes you'll be neck-deep in low-level systems, and other times you'll be pairing up with the front-end team on the user interface.
  * Drive the architecture of our application platform, considering the team and our future product roadmap.
  * Collaborate with product, design, front-end, machine learning, and infrastructure teams.
  * Drive and uphold high engineering standards, bringing consistency to the codebases you encounter and ensuring software is adequately reviewed, tested, and integrated.
  * Mentor, learn, and share knowledge with others along the way.
  * Contribute to the development of software as a medical device aiming at improving patient outcomes

### What youâ€™ll need:

  * Experience. You've been around the block more than a couple times, typically via 5+ years of work in this field.
