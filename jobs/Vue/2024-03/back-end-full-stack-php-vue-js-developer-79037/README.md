Description

**OUR HIRING PROCESS:**

  * We will review your application against our job requirements. We do not employ machine learning technologies during this phase as we believe every human deserves attention from another human.

  * We may then invite you to submit a video interview for the review of the hiring manager. This video interview is often followed by a test or short project that allows us to determine whether you will be a good fit for the team.
