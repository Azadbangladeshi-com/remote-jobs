### About Shakepay

Shakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake, by making it bitcoin-friendly, secure, and rewarding. When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada‚Äôs fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.

### Senior Full Stack Engineer

Imagine shaking your phone to instantly earn bitcoin. Our customers might think it‚Äôs magic, but if you‚Äôre reading this you probably know that it‚Äôs not (or is it?). It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs our stellar dev team that makes it happen. That shaking idea started as a secret easter-egg for our fledgling customer base, and once word got out about it, we suddenly had to deal with service outages from too many people shaking at the same time.

Of course we‚Äôve since solved that problem, and now with over 1,000,000 shakers (aka ‚Äúcustomers''), it‚Äôs a core part of our identity‚Äînot the shaking, but the idea that we came up with something new and exciting in the slow and boring world of financial services. We‚Äôre looking for an senior full stack engineer to help us reimagine how Canadians build wealth and think about what they can do with their money. Unique ideas and the knowledge and determination to make them a reality: that‚Äôs the real magic.

Totally real Shakepay reviews from the future, after you join:

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Does Shakepay run on literal magic?

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I thought magic wasn‚Äôt real. Using Shakepay changed my mind.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Wow, it must‚Äôve taken all 3 genie wishes to make this app!

Oh yeah, we‚Äôre a bitcoin platform. In fact, Shakepay is the easiest way for Canadians to buy and earn bitcoin. We‚Äôve got a one of a kind community of shakers (aka ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù) that keeps on growing, regardless of how the crypto market is doing. They love Shakepay almost as much as they love bitcoin, which is really saying something. To the Bitcoin Golden Age!
