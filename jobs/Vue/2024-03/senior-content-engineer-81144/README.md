### **About the Team:**

As a Senior Content Engineer at Netlify on the Developer Education team, you'll work with a smart, collaborative, and humble set of team members who are very motivated to keep learning and continuing to grow each other in a supportive way.

Within our team, you will play a dynamic and pivotal role. You will be primarily responsible for developing and maintaining the web properties on which we deliver content to developers, including docs.netlify.com and developers.netlify.com, among others. This will require influencing the technical architectural decisions needed to ensure developers can find the content they are looking for with ease. Delivering developer content is our team‚Äôs primary focus, and this role must flex to support the team‚Äôs evolving content priorities. The position must balance creating and maintaining both code and content. On any given day, you may add a feature to the docs site, make edits to docs content, and draft a tutorial on using a new platform feature.

If you are passionate about frontend web development but also crave variability in a role through creating documentation and other developer content, we encourage you to apply!

### **What You‚Äôll Do:**

  * Leverage expert-level knowledge of an array of frontend technologies. Our sites include a mixture of Astro, Vue, React, Next.js, TypeScript, etc.
  * Collaborate with designers and engineers to craft accessible, reusable components and consistent design patterns that can be reused across multiple projects and teams.
  * Ship large features and improvements with minimal guidance or support from other team members.
  * Represent the team and significantly influence the vision and long-term goals for the team and its combination of developer content and web properties.
  * Identify and advocate for solving technical debt or impediments that slow down the team's ability to deliver content to production.
  * Develop and maintain strong testing practices to ensure sites are accessible, functional, and performant.
  * Support content needs through documentation, examples, and developer guides.

###  **What You'll Bring:**

  * An expert level of knowledge of the frontend ecosystem, within a JavaScript-centered workflow.
  * A deep appreciation for semantic HTML, accessibility, and performance.
  * A breadth of experience in implementing design systems or component libraries.
  * Ability to explain complex concepts and procedures clearly and concisely, through documentation and examples.
  * Experience giving and receiving feedback with regard for emotional and technical concerns.
  * A passion for digging into new tools, frameworks, and platforms.
  * Comfort with a Git-centric workflow, including continuous integration, continuous deployment, and solid tooling.
  * We welcome remote candidates based in US, Canada, or the United Kingdom.
  * Lead by example, seek to understand through active listening and questioning, actively address problems you identify, and assume responsibility for your work.
