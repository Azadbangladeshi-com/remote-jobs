You are a communicator, empathetic in understanding your client‚Äôs needs and showing care in their individual concerns. You are assertive and precise, able to convey a cohesive narrative of your work and progress; able to read and write issues that clearly explain your proposed changes.

  * Are flexible and adaptable with excellent verbal and written communication skills,
  * Work together with client teams on their code-base

  * Contribute to opensource projects linked to build systems such as Bazel and their extensions, e.g. rules_haskell, rules_nixpkgs, rules_scala.
  * Participate in public communication via giving talks, writing blog posts, and communicating with colleagues and the Bazel community on Slack and in mailing lists
