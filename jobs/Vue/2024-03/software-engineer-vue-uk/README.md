### Working Details

This is a full-time role (37.5 hours per week). We typically work from 09:00 - 17:30 from Monday to Friday, though we can be flexible around this, just let us know.

Weâ€™re ideally looking for someone in/around Edinburgh, though weâ€™re open to the possibility of this being a remote role (as long as you're in the UK). We're making the most of hybrid working, so you won't need to come into the office everyday (unless you want to!).

We don't mandate required office time, but we find that most of the team enjoy working from home 3-4 days a week, and come into our office to connect with each other, make use of space, and for meetings.

### Join the team!

Equality of opportunity is more than just a responsibility: we believe itâ€™s a huge advantage to welcome a variety of experiences and perspectives into the team. Diversity is a great asset and, as such, we strongly encourage applications from any background.

This is your opportunity to really influence how we get things done, and how our product develops to meet our customersâ€™ needs. We're doing well, but there's lots more to do in order to maintain the high bar and pace that we've set.

Everyone here is growing personally as the company grows, so if that sounds like something youâ€™d like to be part of, weâ€™d love to see your application.

***Please note the successful candidate for this role will be subject to background checks and will have an opportunity to declare anything to us beforehand***
