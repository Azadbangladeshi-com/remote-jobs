#WeAreCrowdStrike and our mission is to stop breaches. As a global leader in cybersecurity, our team changed the game. Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing over 1 trillion events a day with a petabyte of RAM deployed in our Cassandra clusters - and this traffic is growing daily. We‚Äôre looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to developing and shaping our cybersecurity platform. Consistently recognized as a top workplace, CrowdStrike is committed to cultivating an inclusive, remote-first culture that offers people the autonomy and flexibility to balance the needs of work and life while taking their career to the next level. Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.

 **About The Role:**

You'll be joining the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) team to work on the CrowdStrike‚Äôs Falcon platform. CSPM is a relatively new and complementary product area for CrowdStrike. We‚Äôre extending CrowdStrike‚Äôs mission of ‚Äústopping breaches‚Äù into the public cloud control plane and native cloud resources. CrowdStrike‚Äôs CSPM offering will give customers visibility into both the (mis)configuration and compliance of native cloud resources, and potential adversary activity involving those resources. When coupled with Falcon, CrowdStrike‚Äôs endpoint security offering, our CSPM offering will provide a more comprehensive perspective on how the adversary is targeting key customer infrastructure.

As a **UI Engineer** at CrowdStrike, you will work with a talented and dedicated team to build and maintain the user interface for the Falcon platform. You will provide a high-quality user experience that our customers around the world use 24/7 to protect their systems from the most sophisticated adversaries.

Our JavaScript framework is Ember, but if you've used React, Angular, or Vue.js, you'll feel right at home, and we‚Äôll help you get comfortable with both Ember and our codebase. Since we only support evergreen browsers, we can push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible on the web platform while working with truly massive amounts of data. Our ideal candidates are sensitive to the needs of the users and love to find solutions in a unique and dynamic problem space.

We‚Äôre a highly collaborative, friendly, inclusive and diverse group that prizes collaboration over competition. We provide opportunities to learn new skills, mentor fellow engineers, and contribute to the direction of both the team and the products for which we‚Äôre responsible. We work in a distributed, remote-first, high-trust environment where you manage your own time and have the flexibility to balance your work and personal life.

Our ideal candidate will be responsible for taking full ownership of the delivery of our products, driving the technical aspects, helping the team to define the architecture and coordinating with stakeholders in terms of scope and priorities.
