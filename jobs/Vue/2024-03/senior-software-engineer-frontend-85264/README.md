**Our Mission and Opportunity**

Early education is one of the greatest determinants of childhood outcomes, is a must for working families, and has a lasting social and economic impact. Brightwheelâ€™s vision is to enable high quality early education for every child â€” by giving teachers meaningfully more time with students each day, engaging parents in the development of their kids, and supporting the small businesses that make up the backbone of the $175 billion early education market. Brightwheel is the most loved technology brand in early education globally, trusted by thousands of educators and millions of families.

Our exceptional investor group includes Addition, Bessemer Venture Partners, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, GGV Capital, Lowercase Capital, Emerson Collective, and Mark Cuban.

  

We believe that everyoneâ€”from our employees to the students, teachers, and administrators we serveâ€” should be given the opportunity to learn and thrive, whatever their background may be. We celebrate diversity in all forms because it allows our team and the communities we serve to reach their full potential and do their best work.

  

 **Our Culture**

  

We challenge ourselves every day to improve quality of lifeâ€”from our employees to the students, teachers, and administrators we serve. We care deeply about how our work enriches our customers now and scales for the future.

We are owners and see our work through. We are growth-minded, we iterate, and we seek to continuously improve. We are pragmatic, and we root decisions in data, logic, and intuition. Yet we value speed and a strong bias for action. We lean into collaboration, assume the best from everyone, and welcome differing opinions. We have audacious goals with a can-do attitude, break down walls to get stuff done, and are resourceful in order to accomplish more with less.
