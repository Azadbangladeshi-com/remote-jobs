  * Youâ€™ll work with peers within the Plan Stage along with Engineering, Product, and UX counterparts to iterate on new features within your group and across the Plan stage.

### About the team

Youâ€™ll be joining either the Product Planning or Project Management team, which are part of the Plan stage, consisting of a globally distributed team where there is a culture of autonomy. Youâ€™ll also get the chance to work directly with Product Design and Product Management counterparts from time to time.

How do we work together? It starts with milestones planned through collaboration between the PM and EM where we identify and schedule deliverables for a given milestone, additionally, we also like to plan a few milestones in advance and prepare an Issue Board containing a list of Issues for current and a few future milestones which team members can use to pick work from. This process allows for engineers to prioritise deliverables, as well as pick up extra work voluntarily.
